18219,BROTHER OF SETH RICH Works For Cyber Security Firm…Reportedly BLOCKED Family’s Private Investigator From Determining If Seth Was Wikileaks Source…Refused To Let Investigator See Seth’s Computer: “I already checked it…Don’t worry about it”,"What the heck is going on? Why is the media, who has been virtually silent about former DNC staffer Seth Rich s death until now, coming out to attack President Trump and his administration, accusing them of pushing a false narrative about his murder? Shouldn t every American regardless of political affiliation want to get to the bottom of Rich s suspicious death? Why is there so much secrecy and mystery surrounding the staffer who was getting ready to move over to the Hillary campaign when he was murdered on the streets of DC, only blocks from his home early in the morning, after he was last seen leaving a local bar he frequented. The DC police called it a robbery. The  robbers  didn t take his wallet, the contents of his wallet or his expensive watch.Aaron Rich, who had reportedly been blocking his family s private investigator from looking into whether or not his brother Seth was a WikiLeaks source, works for an influential defense contractor that provides cyber security.According to a source close to the Rich family, Aaron works for Northrup Grumman, which was named as the fifth-largest defense contractor in the world in 2015. The source did not provide what his specific role is at the company. It s not just hacking and defending, there s a lot more to it,  a cyber software engineer at Northrup Grumman says in a video on the company s website.As we previously reported, Aaron Rich was actively attempting to shut down anyone looking into the WikiLeaks connection according to Rod Wheeler, who was brought on as a private investigator in his brother s murder case.Wheeler said that brother Aaron Rich tried to block Wheeler from looking at Seth s computer, even though there could be evidence on it.  He said no, he said I have his computer, meaning him,  Wheeler said.  I said, well can I look at it? He said, what are you looking for? I said anything that could indicate if Seth was having problems with someone. He said no, I already checked it. Don t worry about it. Aaron also blocked Wheeler from finding out about who was at a party Seth attended the night of the murder. All I want you to do is work on the botched robbery theory and that s it,  Aaron told Wheeler, according to Wheeler s claim on the audio. Wheeler said that Seth s father Joel  does not appear to have any hidden agenda. Rich was shot in the back in the early morning hours of July 10, 2016, near his home while he was on the phone with his girlfriend   12 days before the publication of the DNC emails by WikiLeaks. The police initially ruled that it was a botched robbery   but his wallet, watch, and necklace were still on his person when he was discovered by police.Big League Politics has also released an audio recording of journalist Seymour Hersh stating that Seth Rich was in fact WikiLeaks  source.Listen to the Seymour Hersh interview here: All I know is that he offered a sample, an extensive sample, I m sure dozens of emails, and said  I want money.  Later, WikiLeaks did get the password, he had a DropBox, a protected DropBox,  he said. They got access to the DropBox. Hersh also states that Rich had concerns about something happening to him,  the word was passed, according to the NSA report, he also shared this DropBox with a couple of friends, so that  if anything happens to me it s not going to solve your problems,  he added.  WikiLeaks got access before he was killed. For entire story: Big League Politics ",left-news,"Aug 2, 2017"
20353,FULL-FRONTAL ASSAULT ON CENSORSHIP: CANADA’S Post Office Refuses To Deliver Satirical Newspaper Because It’s “Offensive”,"The death of free speech seems to be catching fire around the world. The Left is winning the propaganda war, but the Right is beating them at the polls. Lets hope the trend continues through our elections in November TORONTO   Canada s post office says it will no longer deliver a Toronto-area newspaper described as openly anti-Semitic. Canadians who value free speech   and let s hope that is all of us   should be deeply troubled by Ottawa s decision to tell Canada Post to stop carrying a fringe Toronto newspaper.Those who have campaigned against the free paper are  ecstatic.  But consider the awful precedent this act of postal censorship sets.If people who are offended by something that appears in their mailbox can complain and get it banned from the post, where does it stop? Can a pro-choice feminist block the graphic pro-life pamphlet that comes in the mail? Can a fierce pro-lifer ban a flier from an abortion clinic? Or consider the feelings of the victim of East European communism who gets a Marxist tract in the mail? Why should an agency of the government that her taxes support be allowed to introduce that propaganda into her home?This is the trouble with just about all limits on free speech. Who says what is beyond the pale? Deciding to block child pornography or open incitement to violence is easy enough, because of the direct physical harm they can be shown to cause. After that, it gets tricky.Someone must have the power to determine what is dangerous or odious speech and what is merely passionate expression. It is always a matter of opinion. The line is impossible to draw, the scope for abuse endless.Even in democratic countries, authorities have often succumbed to the impulse to black out what they don t like. Communist propaganda was blocked on the grounds that it threatened national security, erotica on the grounds that it undermined public morals. The postal system was once one of the main agents of censorship. A century ago, postal censors blocked mailed instalments of James Joyce s Ulysses.Your Ward News is not Ulysses. Its editor, James Sears, who has been known to style himself as Dimitri the Lover, told City News that Hitler is his second-biggest idol, after Jesus. He ends his e-mails  Expel the Parasite!    all in capital letters, of course. The group that has been fighting him calls his publication a  neo-Nazi-rag  that  has been permitted to disseminate racism, homophobia, misogyny and anti-Semitism to as many as 300,000 homes in Toronto. If so, there are a couple of ways to fight back short of censorship. One is simply to toss Your Ward News where it belongs: in the recycling bin. Nobody is forced to read it when it comes in the mail. People like Mr. Sears thrive on the oxygen of attention. Ignoring him is the best revenge.Another is to argue back. If his opponents feel his maunderings are too despicable to pass over, they can always denounce or refute him. It is always better to fight speech with speech than to gag the speaker.It is a good time to remember these old lessons about how to handle troublesome speech. Free expression is always under attack to some degree, and the danger seems especially acute today. The little tussle over Your Ward News is part of a wider struggle.

18335,CHICAGO: 20-YR-OLD MUSLIM WOMAN Drops Baby To Death From 8th Floor Apartment Window…Judge Sentences Her To 4 Years Probation,"Mubashra Uddin, a 20-year-old Muslim college student and daughter of Pakistani immigrants dropped her newborn infant out of an eight-story apartment window in Chicago on November 11, 2015, and was just sentenced to only four years of probation.In the strict Muslim home where Uddin was raised, even speaking to boys   particularly African-American ones   was forbidden, relatives said.When her Pakistan-born parents found out about her boyfriend, they pulled her out of the high school and home-schooled her for her last two years, according to her family and friends.Uddin found out she was pregnant when she was 19 and only told her boyfriend and her closest friend. But in the strict Muslim home where Uddin was raised, even speaking to boys   particularly African-American ones   was forbidden, relatives said. When her Pakistan-born parents found out about her boyfriend, they pulled her out of the high school and home-schooled her for her last two years, according to her family and friends.She gave birth in her room in a three-bedroom apartment shared with her family in Chicago s Uptown neighborhood.Shortly after giving birth, she heard her mother coming down the hall and dropped her newborn out of her eight-story window.The newborn suffered broken ribs, a fractured skull, and spine, and a lacerated aorta and liver. A neighbor found the infant, still alive, on the ground, wrapped her up, and brought her to the hospital where she later died. The act of dropping a newborn out of an eighth-story window to its eventual death is exceedingly evil, exceedingly cruel,  Judge James Brown said Thursday as he ordered Uddin held without bail. With all her family has put her through, I m surprised she didn t jump out of the window herself,  said the mother of Uddin s former boyfriend, who asked not to be identified in order to keep her son s identity secret. Sometimes she felt under pressure to be this perfect daughter   even pressure to be this perfect Muslim woman that prayed, fasted, was humble and also didn t make mistakes,  a longtime friend, identified only as  Nina O.,  wrote to the judge.Uddin loved babies, according to family and friends.Prosecutors said that after she admitted guilt, police searched her home and found bloody sheets, bloody scissors and blood on the floor next to her bed, as well as near and on the window.

8737," MI Gov. Dick Sends SEVEN National Guardsman To Help 100,000 Flint Residents","Earlier this week, as public outrage and media attention focused on his failed response to the Flint water disaster, Michigan s republican governor announced that he was calling in the National Guard to help deal with the escalating crisis.On January 13, those troops arrived in the city of 100,000 people. All SEVEN of them. Yes, seven. As in one less than eight.Doing the math, Snyder s response equates to one guardsman per 14,285.7 people.The city of Flint is experiencing a crisis of epic proportions, thanks entirely to the Snyder administration. Water poisoned with lead, and water that is potentially contaminated with the Legionella bacteria (which has already caused 87 serious illnesses and ten deaths) is just one aspect of what is happening in Flint.After the governor and his appointed emergency managers switched the city s water supply to the Flint River, they decided not to bother to treat it with standard corrosion control measures.According to researchers from Virginia Tech University, Flint is the only city in the U.S. that did not have these measures in place.As Marc Edwards of the Virginia Tech water study described to Michigan Radio back in October: What we discovered to our shock was that they switched to a new water source that was obviously very corrosive, meaning it would eat up the lead pipe and iron pipe and essentially put the metals into the water, without controlling the corrosion. And this is a horrible idea in a city full of lead plumbing and lead pipe like Flint. He went on to describe the standard practice for changing a water source. Before you switch to a new water source, six months to a year ahead of time, you are supposed to do laboratory experiments to determine the corrosivity of the water, and the chemistry   the pH, the alkalinity, and the phosphate that you need to make sure that the lead stays on the pipes and out of the water. Edwards explains that Flint s new water system had to have a  corrosion control  plan in place, otherwise the result is that you re  doing an uncontrolled human experiment on a city s population. The decision by Rick Snyder s emergency manager to just skip what was apparently viewed as an  unnecessary  corrosion control expense has basically been just that.  An uncontrolled experiment on a city s population. The amount of damage done to the city s infrastructure is just beginning to be realized.This photo from Flint Water Study researchers Ni Zhu and Siddhartha Roy shows the magnitude of the situtuation.Image credit: Flint Water StudyAccording to a new report released today, researchers believe that the damaged and corroded pipes that are transmitting water throughout the city are likely to become a breeding ground for bacteria, such as the Legionella bacteria which causes Legionaire s disease, along with a host of other potential pathogens.Because of the nature of the Legionella bacteria, which is transmitted through tiny droplets of water in the air, Virginia Tech researchers are recommending that vulnerable populations have minimal contact with the water. That includes people who smoke, the elderly, people with diabetes, people who have recently had surgery and others who might be at greater risk of contracting a waterborne respiratory disease.About 100,000 Flint residents are affected by this unmitigated disaster.In response, Governor Snyder put on a big show of  sending in the National Guard.  Now we know that only SEVEN guardsmen were actually dispatched to the city.After being forced to respond to questions regarding the number of guardsmen he sent to the city, the governor s office proclaimed that there could be as many as 30 or 40 National Guardsmen sent to Flint by the end of the week.During his PR conference on Tuesday, Snyder told the people of Michigan  As we work to ensure that all Flint residents have access to clean and safe drinking water, we are providing them with the direct assistance they need in order to stretch our resources further. The Michigan National Guard is trained and ready to assist the citizens of Flint. He neglected to mention that he was sending SEVEN guardsmen.As reported by Fox 2: The Governor s rhetoric is not doing much to quiet the growing fury in Flint. Gov. Rick Snyder called in the National Guard to assist those helping to get bottled water and filters to the people of Flint. Just seven members of the National Guard showed up to help the nearly 100,000 people in Flint. Watch this video on Governor Snyder s pathetic response to the Flint water disaster, via Fox 2.

22864,REALLY FAKE NEWS: New York Times Finally Retracts Its ’17 Intelligence Agencies’ Claim on Russia Hacking US Elections,"21st Century Wire says Back during the 2016 election, 21WIRE declared with confidence how the US government and mainstream media s  Russian Hacking  meme as hoax. It turns out   we were right. More than mere canards however, these type of media disinformation talking points are how the establishment manufactures public consent for corrupt and dysfunctional policies. Once these fabricated talking points are circulated through the media, they later make their way into the mouths of politicians who repeat them incessantly, and in the case of the Senate and Congressional committee hearings on Russia and cabinet confirmation hearing   use the fake canards to bully people who are testifying on Capitol Hill. The fake  17 intelligence  agency claim was used by nearly everyone who used the hearings to grandstand and act tough on Russia, including pro-war Senators John McCain, Marco Rubio, Adam Schiff and countless others. It was also employed by Hillary Clinton, along with ever single panel  expert  on CNN and MSNBC who used the lie to prop-up their contrived and politicized narratives about how Russia hacked and influenced the 2016 election.What s more crucial though, is to realize the absolute key role to New York Times plays in this process of giving fake news the venire of officialdom at a government and mainstream level. They are a pivotal distribution point in the western propaganda dissemination machine   as nearly every US broadcast network across 4 time zones will routinely reference the New York Times as their primary source. 21WIRE has chronicled their exploits in helping to promote a series of illegal US-waged wars around the world.Consortium News Exclusive: A founding Russia-gate myth is that all 17 U.S. intelligence agencies agreed that Russia hacked into and distributed Democratic emails, a falsehood that The New York Times has belatedly retracted, reports Robert Parry Robert Parry  Consortium NewsThe New York Times has finally admitted that one of the favorite Russia-gate canards   that all 17 U.S. intelligence agencies concurred on the assessment of Russian hacking of Democratic emails   is false.On Thursday, the Times appended a correction to a June 25 article that had repeated the false claim, which has been used by Democrats and the mainstream media for months to brush aside any doubts about the foundation of the Russia-gate scandal and portray President Trump as delusional for doubting what all 17 intelligence agencies supposedly knew to be true.In the Times  White House Memo of June 25, correspondent Maggie Haberman mocked Trump for  still refus[ing] to acknowledge a basic fact agreed upon by 17 American intelligence agencies that he now oversees: Russia orchestrated the attacks, and did it to help get him elected. However, on Thursday, the Times   while leaving most of Haberman s ridicule of Trump in place   noted in a correction that the relevant intelligence  assessment was made by four intelligence agencies   the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Security Agency. The assessment was not approved by all 17 organizations in the American intelligence community. The Times  grudging correction was vindication for some Russia-gate skeptics who had questioned the claim of a full-scale intelligence assessment, which would usually take the form of a National Intelligence Estimate (or NIE), a product that seeks out the views of the entire Intelligence Community and includes dissents.The reality of a more narrowly based Russia-gate assessment was admitted in May by President Obama s Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and Obama s CIA Director John Brennan in sworn congressional testimony.Clapper testified before a Senate Judiciary subcommittee on May 8 that the Russia-hacking claim came from a  special intelligence community assessment  (or ICA) produced by selected analysts from the CIA, NSA and FBI,  a coordinated product from three agencies   CIA, NSA, and the FBI   not all 17 components of the intelligence community,  the former DNI said.Clapper further acknowledged that the analysts who produced the Jan. 6 assessment on alleged Russian hacking were  hand-picked  from the CIA, FBI and NSA.Yet, as any intelligence expert will tell you, if you  hand-pick  the analysts, you are really hand-picking the conclusion. For instance, if the analysts were known to be hard-liners on Russia or supporters of Hillary Clinton, they could be expected to deliver the one-sided reportthat they did.Politicized IntelligenceIn the history of U.S. intelligence, we have seen how this selective approach has worked, such as the phony determination of the Reagan administration pinning the attempted assassination of Pope John Paul II and other acts of terror on the Soviet Union.CIA Director William Casey and Deputy Director Robert Gates shepherded the desired findings through the process by putting the assessment under the control of pliable analysts and sidelining those who objected to this politicization of intelligence.The point of enlisting the broader intelligence community   and incorporating dissents into a final report   is to guard against such  stove-piping  of intelligence that delivers the politically desired result but ultimately distorts reality.Another painful example of politicized intelligence was President George W. Bush s 2002 National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq s WMD that removed State Department and other dissents from the declassified version that was given to the public.Since Clapper s and Brennan s testimony in May, the Times and other mainstream news outlets have avoided a direct contradiction of their earlier acceptance of the 17-intelligence-agencies canard by simply referring to a judgment by  the intelligence community. That finessing of their earlier errors has allowed Hillary Clinton and other senior Democrats to continue referencing this fictional consensus without challenge, at least in the mainstream media.For instance, on May 31 at a technology conference in California, Clinton referred to the Jan. 6 report, asserting that  Seventeen agencies, all in agreement, which I know from my experience as a Senator and Secretary of State, is hard to get. They concluded with high confidence that the Russians ran an extensive information war campaign against my campaign, to influence voters in the election. The failure of the major news organizations to clarify this point about the 17 agencies may have contributed to Haberman s mistake on June 25 as she simply repeated the groupthink that nearly all the Important People in Washington just knew to be true.But the Times  belated correction also underscores the growing sense that the U.S. mainstream media has joined in a political vendetta against Trump and has cast aside professional standards to the point of repeating false claims designed to denigrate him.That, in turn, plays into Trump s Twitter complaints that he and his administration are the targets of a  witch hunt  led by the  fake news  media, a grievance that appears to be energizing his supporters and could discredit whatever ongoing investigations eventually conclude.Investigative reporter Robert Parry broke many of the Iran-Contra stories for The Associated Press and Newsweek in the 1980s.

3489," New Poll Shows How Batsh** CRAZY Trump Fans Are, Gives Them A BRUTAL Reality Check (IMAGES)","The supporters of President-elect Donald Trump are very much like him   they live in their own little world, completely unaware of how history and the country has progressed. Thanks to a new poll that was recently revealed on MSNBC s  The Rachel Maddow Show  yesterday, we re able to see just how far removed Trump supporters are from reality.According to a recent Public Policy Polling (PPP) poll, Trump and his supports rarely have any grasp or knowledge of basic facts that are only a Google search away   and they don t really care about becoming informed. Maddow highlighted just how off Trump supporters were regarding some of the biggest issues our country has been faced with, and the findings were truly pathetic.It turns out, almost 40 percent of Trump supports truly think that President Barack Obama has caused the stock market to go down. The truth is, the stock market has DOUBLED during Obama s time in the White House:TwitterAnother thing that Trump and his rabid fans like to whine about is the unemployment rate. Despite numerous reports coming out about how Obama has done wonders for the unemployment rate, 67 percent of Trump lovers are saying it has increased. The truth is that in January 2009, the unemployment rate was 7.8 percent   and thanks to Obama, it is now 4.6 percent as of last month.TwitterTrump voters are also very uninformed about Trump s rival, Hillary Clinton   and we can thank Trump himself for that.

Even worse   60 percent think  millions  of illegal voters contributed to Clinton s win (another rumor that Trump is solely responsible for).TwitterThis is truly depressing, and shows just how much trouble America is in when Trump begins his term and his clueless followers are given even more reason to ignore facts. These polls show just how gullible Trump voters are and how easily they eat up Trump s weird conspiracy theories and fear-driven rhetoric.

4363, Mike Pence VICIOUSLY Refused To Pardon Black Man Wrongfully Imprisoned For 10 Years,"Republicans are so scared and desperate about the Pence-Kaine debate that they ve resorted to distorting Tim Kaine s record as a defense attorney   in which, yes, he had to defend murderers. But anyone who took a civics course (or has half a brain cell) knows that everyone, even accused murderers, are entitled to representation in a court of law.It s 2016, why is that still being debated?Seeing as though there s nothing shocking about that drummed up  scandal,  a real scandal lies on the horizon, and it has to do not with Tim Kaine, but Mike Pence.After serving 10 years of a 40 year sentence, Keith Cooper   who was accused of shooting Michael Kershner and his mother, Nona Canell   was found to be innocent after the victims admitted they were wrong, DNA evidence proved he was not at the scene, and a jail informant admitted to lying.After filing a pardon request, in which the board unanimously voted that Pence should indeed pardon Mr. Cooper, Pence balked. Why? [O]ut of respect for the judicial process,  Pence claimed, saying that Cooper s paperwork wasn t  in order  after a two year delay by the state. Pence s office admitted they haven t given th case much thought, but somehow thought it appropriate to slam Cooper s lawyer, saying they need to  do a better job. Cooper s attorney, Elliot Solsar, then claimed Pence bucked the case because he s running for president, and is instead trying to pass it off to his successor (if he wins in November):We are really disappointed in Governor Pence s failure to provide justice to an innocent man. It s clear that he has punted the petition to the next Governor because it s election season.Is that what Trump, Pence s running mate, means when he says they are the  law and order candidates? I wonder if the circumstances would be different if Cooper were white, instead of a black man. Black people, after all, are wrongfully convicted at higher rates than white people:The National Registry currently cites a total of 1,417 exonerations   the majority of which are attributed to Black defendants.By the Registry s own statistics broken down by race and crime, total exonerations for  all crimes  numbered 164 for Hispanic persons, 556 for Caucasian persons, and 662 for Black persons. The largest gap is associated with sexual assault (a difference of 78 exonerations), with the second largest belonging to homicide (a difference of 59 exonerations).Not only are black people more likely to be victims of wrongful conviction, they also wait longer to exonerating than others.In 2014, Pamela Perez, professor of biostatistics at Loma Linda University, told the Huffington Post:Blacks who are exonerated after a bogus conviction have served 12.68 years on average before the good news. It takes just 9.4 years for whites and 7.87 for Latinos.Racist governors like Mike Pence, while being stubborn and cruel, continue this system that has shown to be immoral, unfair, and unethical towards black Americans in modern society.Tim Kaine would be wise to bring this major issue up at the first debate.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"October 4, 2016"
4735, Mural Of Gov. LePage Wearing KKK Garb Has Maine City In Uproar (IMAGE),"The city of Portland, Maine has been thrown into pandemonium after a mural of the state s bigoted governor decked out in full Ku Klux Klan regalia appeared.The original graffiti art was painted onto the wall of the Portland Water District s wastewater treatment plant and featured Maine Gov. Paul LePage donning the trademark hood and robe of the KKK. Given the slew of racist remarks that he spews almost continuously, the image is fairly fitting. Next to the 6-foot-high likeness of LePage are the words racist,   homophobe  and  moron.   Governor,  the last word listed, is crossed out with a red line.City won t remove graffiti of ""racist"" Maine Gov. LePage wearing KKK hood https://t.co/9KkhiUSVPp pic.twitter.com/PNvIaJhiob  Talking Points Memo (@TPM) September 6, 2016The wall art sparked a string of graffiti and the image has since undergone several transformations. Portland resident Mark Reilly painted over the image with white paint, then a group of women scrubbed off his cover-up. By 10pm on Tuesday, the image had been reduced to just LePage s face with Mickey Mouse ears above his head. All references to the KKK were gone and the mural now reads only No Hate  and  Hate is Hate. As for city officials, they have been in turmoil over what should be down about the graffiti as well. Portland Mayor Ethan Strimling wanted the image removed. I do not want it up there. It is not reflective of our values,  Strimling said Tuesday.  The KKK has a long, problematic history in the state of Maine, and equating the governor and his rhetoric, as much as we disagree with it, is a step too far. The wall belongs to the Portland Water District and they have not removed graffiti from the wall in decades and has been treated as a public canvas. City officials initially said that they had no intention of removing the image, citing free speech. But later in the day, water district spokeswoman Michelle Clements said that the city and the district s general manager were discussing what should be done about the mural.Strimling, who has been known to be at odds with the Republican governor, clarified on Tuesday that his reasoning for suggesting that the mural should be removed had nothing to do with concern for LePage. I am as frustrated as the next person with the governor s rhetoric,  he said.  It is not appropriate to trivialize the KKK. LePage has a bad habit of letting his racism hang out for the world to see on a regular basis. He made headlines a few months ago when said black guys named  shifty  are coming into his state to sell drugs and impregnate young white girls. More recently, he said that he is at  war  and declared black people to be the enemy.

2846, BUSTED: Trump’s Senior WH Staff Have Email Accounts On A Private Server (DETAILS),"When Donald Trump was a running for office, he and his conservative followers repeatedly called for  locking up  Hillary Clinton for handling government work with a private server while secretary of state. Hypocrisy, thy name is GOP. Newsweek is reporting that senior Trump administration staffers have active accounts on a Republican National Committee email system. Kellyanne Conway, Jared Kushner, Sean Spicer and Steve Bannon are among those who are using the system (rnchq.org)   the same one the George W. Bush administration was accused of using in order to evade transparency rules after claiming to have  lost  22 million emails.What they re doing is not illegal but it is ironic.But after then-candidate Donald Trump and the Republicans repeatedly called for  locking up  Hillary Clinton for handling government work with a private server while secretary of state, the new White House staff risks repeating the same mistake that dogged the Democrat s presidential campaign. They also face a security challenge: The RNC email system, according to U.S. intelligence, was hacked during the 2016 race.  They better be careful after making such a huge ruckus over the private email over at the State Department,  says former Bush administration lawyer Richard Painter.And by the way, Hillary Clinton s server use did not violate the law. Still yet, last July, an informal adviser to Donald Trump s presidential campaign called for Hillary Clinton s execution. Al Baldasaro said that Clinton  should be put in the firing line and shot for treason  because of her use of private email server.It s not known yet how the Trump staffers are using the RNC email addresses, however, if they are actively using them then they are subject to the  Disclosure Requirement For Official Business Conducted Using Electronic Messaging Accounts. If White House staffers have already used the RNC emails system for White House work, they must copy or forward those communications into the government system within 20 days.But wait, there s more!The New York Times is reporting that Trump is still using his  old, unsecured Android phone  to take calls and tweet despite  protests from some of his aides. Last night when Trump tweeted that he would send in the Feds  to Chicago, he was using his Android. As for the White House phones, Trump said they are  the world s most secure system,  adding,  The words just explode in the air. Notably, this is the same RNC server that multiple intelligence agencies and officials claim was hacked during the 2016 race.Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images.",News,"January 25, 2017"
8409, Bigots Upset Their Daughter Was Taught World History Suing Maryland Public School,"John and Melissa Wood are typical right-wing loons. After their daughter told them about her class assignments, John Wood set off to LaPlata High School in Maryland in a fit of rage. His daughter, it seems, was taught about Islam as part of a world history course, which didn t sit well with the bigoted former marine or his wife.According to the Woods, their daughter was forced to accept Islam as her one true religion and was forced to memorize the five tenets of the faith. They argued that the class only spent a single day on Christianity and then moved on to two weeks of Islamic training.Learning to recite things in the course of a history class is what most people would call  studying,  but the dad found it so vile that she was being forced to convert to Islam that he went to the school and threatened the faculty, resulting in an immediate ban from the property and a no trespass order from local law enforcement.While the school contends that the reality of the situation doesn t fit the narrative the bigots have concocted, the Woods have decided to sue the school with the help of the Thomas Moore Law Center, the right-wing crackpot firm that unsuccessfully argues for intelligent design and Christian indoctrination in schools on a regular basis. The center said in court filings: A school cannot achieve diversity by punishing and alienating students who hold Judeo-Christian beliefs, while bolstering the doctrines and teachings of other religions. Parents must be ever vigilant to the Islamic indoctrination of their children under the guise of teaching history and multiculturalism. This is happening in public schools across the country. And they must take action to stop it. Yeah, that s not at all what s going on. As the school explained in a statement to WTOP: The particular unit in question is on the formation of Middle Eastern empires in which students learned the basic concepts of the Islamic faith and how it, along with politics, culture, economics and geography, contributed to the development of the Middle East. Other religions are introduced when they influence or impact a particular historical era or geographic region. For example, when reviewing the Renaissance and Reformation, students study the concepts and role of Christianity. When learning about the development of China and India, students examine Hinduism and Buddhism It doesn t matter how you try to explain teaching Islam to right-wing imbeciles. They see all Muslims as a threat the them. They hear the word  Muslim  in a public school and their heads explode, because the 1st Amendment says no religion in public places. Now tell that teacher to lead those kids in christian prayer before it s too late for them.The most ridiculous argument the suit brings is this: The course also taught false statements such as Allah is the same God worshiped by Christians and Islam is a  religion of peace' According to these people a religion of a billion people are out to kill us all. Considering if that were true they would only have to get about 6 people each to kill all non-Muslims, you have to wonder why it hasn t happened already. You also have to wonder how people can continue to call Islam a  pagan  religion when the tribe Mohammed came from was directly descended from Ishmael, son of Abraham, considered the steward of the faith to his tribe and brother of Isaac, patriarch of Judaism.I learned that from a high school world history course.The Woods are asking for injunctive relief barring the teaching of anything that has to with Islam from school grounds and for the trespass order to be lifted. It shouldn t be long before this case, much like all of the other zealot-friendly issues brought by the Moore Center.Featured image from Wikipedia",News,"January 31, 2016"

2733, Steve Bannon Promised That There Is ‘No Doubt’ We Will Be At War With China Soon (AUDIO),"According to white supremacist dirtbag, former head honcho of far-Right propaganda factory Breitbart, and Donald Trump s chief strategist Steve Bannon, the administration expects to throw us into a war with China within the next few years if their plans work out.Speaking on his radio show in March, Bannon said that relations with China would deteriorate and we will be at  war in the South China Sea in five to 10 years. There s no doubt about that. They re taking their sandbars and making basically stationary aircraft carriers and putting missiles on those. They come here to the United States in front of our face   and you understand how important face is   and say it s an ancient territorial sea,  Bannon said.He s likely right that the United States will be involved in some conflict, but it will be because of the Trump administration that this happens. Throughout his campaign and even after he was elected President-With-An-Asterisk, the Donald has been poking China repeatedly. We can t continue to allow China to rape our country, and that s what they re doing,  Trump said while campaigning in May. We re going to turn it around. And we have the cards, don t forget it. We re like the piggy bank that s being robbed. We have the cards. We have a lot of power with China. Just before he was sworn in, Trump needled china on Twitter and caused an international incident by bragging that the President of Taiwan  CALLED  (caps are all him) to congratulate him on his victory. The President of Taiwan CALLED ME today to wish me congratulations on winning the Presidency. Thank you!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 3, 2016China has been taking out massive amounts of money & wealth from the U.S. in totally one-sided trade, but won't help with North Korea. Nice!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 2, 2017In the past, Bannon has compared himself to Lenin. According to the white nationalist misinformation pimp, Lenin wanted to destroy the state, and that s my goal too. I want to bring everything crashing down, and destroy all of today s establishment    a great goal for someone Trump just installed on the National Security Council.If Trump and Bannon have their way (and so far, Republicans have allowed them to get away with a lot), they will be able to act on all their twisted fantasies of bombing every nation that they don t like.

In fact, he s made a career out of being a conman. From scamming businesses in real estate ventures to hosting a  reality  television show to his most recent and brutal scam   getting people to think he s actually qualified to be *president (he s not).Even Trump trying to get folks to believe that the news is fake is more proof that he s a conman. You see, if the news reports on everything he is doing wrong, people will stop believing him, and he can t have that. So, what does he do? Make the phrase  fake news!  popular.Hitting back on Trump s attack on the free press was none other than legendary author Stephen King, and he says what we re all thinking when it comes to Trump.King kept it short, brutal and directly to the point.

3256, ‘I’m Not A Racist’: Trump Campaign Official Blames Media For Racist Tirade Against The Obamas,"Carl Paladino, who served as the co-chairman of Donald Trump s New York campaign, wrote a wish list of what he d like for the New Year. He wished death and beastiality upon President Obama and wanted the First Lady to be  let loose  in Africa to live with a gorilla. Paladino also serves as a Buffalo School Board member and people have been calling for him to resign over his racist attack on the Obamas. I was wired up, primed to be human and make a mistake,  he wrote in a statement obtained by WBEN.  I could not have made a worse choice in the words I used to express my feelings. And that s where he should have stopped but unfortunately, he didn t:Even as Paladino apologized for hurting  the minority community  with his racist remarks, he took shots at the  attacking parasites,   vanquished progressive haters,  and  mean spirited disoriented press [sic]  who took issue with his comments. He also called Obama a  yellow-bellied coward  and  lazy ass president. I certainly am not a racist,  he insisted, then stated,  No, I m not leaving the school board.  He said he made a mistake then he blamed the media.Paladino also said the survey answers were accidentally sent to Artvoice. I filled out the survey to send to a couple friends and forwarded it to them not realizing that I didn t hit  forward  I hit  reply,  he said.  All men make mistakes.  In other words, he didn t mean to get caught being a racist.In the survey, Paladino wrote that he hopes  Obama catches mad cow disease after being caught having relations with a Herford. He added that he wishes  [Obama] dies before his trial and is buried in a cow pasture next to Valerie Jarret [sic], who died weeks prior, after being convicted of sedition and treason, when a Jihady [sic] cell mate [sic] mistook her for being a nice person and decapitated her. As for Mrs. Obama, he said he would  like her to return to being a male and let loose in the outback of Zimbabwe where she lives comfortably in a cave with Maxie, the gorilla. Yes, you are a racist, Mr. Paladino. Put your big boy pants on and own your words instead of attacking the media for reporting it.Photo by Audrey C. Tiernan-Pool/Getty",News,"December 27, 2016"
8257, Senator Slimeball Is At It Again: Cruz Sends Fake ‘Checks’ To Trick Voters Into Giving Him Money,"It might just be time to say Sen. Ted Cruz, in his desperation to win, is running the most disgusting, deceitful political campaign in U.S. history. He seems eager to keep using these underhanded tactics. He clearly enjoys it.After unapolegetically pissing off the entire state of Iowa with fraudulent mailers, Cruz immediately traveled to New Hampshire and beyond where  he s doing the exact same thing. In New Jersey, for example, residents woke up this week to find that Cruz had sent them a  check  in the mail.For a struggling family, a bit of free money coming in the mail out of the blue could mean everything. Tearing it open, what did they find? A shameless campaign tactic designed to get them to give money to Cruz s floundering campaign. Rather than a check made out to them, Cruz s campaign took it upon themselves to write out a check paid to the order of  Cruz for President  for $45.00.It was all part of Cruz s (possibly illegal) money-making scheme that he s used in recent weeks. Cruz has suggested that he has  secret  wealthy backers that have promised to match donations with regular voters. He begs supporters to give him as much money as they can so that these anonymous, super-secret definitely  real  rich friends of his will double the money.While these underhanded tactics probably do work to get Cruz the money he needs to pay people to like him, it s hard to imagine they are doing wonders for his electability. At this rate, there won t be a state in the country that Cruz hasn t personally disgusted with his slimeball campaign. Iowa s state government is already floating the idea that they will be looking into legal action against Cruz s campaign for the numerous election laws that Cruz skated the line of.For Cruz, all of this backlash might be worth it. He s long been considered one of the most reviled people in politics. People who know him, people who work with him, people who once lived with him in college, all say he s a creep. He s not going to win votes by popularity or policy. Instead, his campaign has always been about raising a ton of money from a select group of millionaires and billionaires and then desperately clinging onto fringe right voters who find his homophobia and poor-shaming rhetoric  a turn on.If Cruz s campaign continues to drag for the duration of the primaries, expect to see all the stops pulled out. His team is clearly looking for any possible way to win   ethics and lawfulness need not apply.Featured image from Gage Skidmore/Flickr ",News,"February 8, 2016"
3286," Netanyahu Whines About U.N. Resolution, Refuses To Abide By Terms Like A True Tyrant","Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu threw a temper tantrum like a petulant child because the United Nations finally passed a resolution condemning Israel s illegal settlements.For decades, Israel has been seizing more and more territory for themselves from the Palestinian people as nations around the world, including the United States oppose what they are doing. All the while, Israel has been fragrantly ignoring what the rest of the world thinks even as America continues to give Israel billions of taxpayer dollars to combine with their own military budget, a military they have repeatedly used to commit genocide against Palestinians.The best solution for peace is a two-state solution, but Israel rejects the idea because they want the land for themselves.And that forced President Obama and United States Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power to abstain from a U.N. vote on a resolution condemning the Israeli settlements. Applause within the United Nations broke out upon passage, proving that the world is tired of the conflict in the Middle East and wants to end it even if it means Israel does not get everything it wants.But Netanyahu threw a hissy fit in a statement on Friday whining about the resolution and accusing President Obama of abandoning Israel. Israel categorically rejects the despicable anti-Israeli resolution at the UN, and will not adhere to it,  the Prime Minister s Office said in a seething statement after the council voted in favor of the motion 14-0. While the Security Council does nothing to prevent the massacre of half a million people in Syria, it is shamefully singling out Israel   the only democracy in the Middle East. The Obama administration not only failed to defend Israel from this harassment at the UN, it cooperated with it behind the scenes. Israel is looking forward to working with President-elect Trump and with out friends in Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, to undo the damage of this absurd resolution. In reality, while President Obama still supports Israel s right to exist, he refuses to let Netanyahu bully us. For years, Netanyahu has refused to halt the settlements that prevent peace talks from moving forward. He has also been itching to start a war against Iran so he can sit back and watch as our troops fight and die doing Israel s dirty work.And frankly, if President Obama really hatred Israel, he would have let Iran wipe it off the f*cking map years ago and would never have approved the ridiculous $38 billion in military aid over the next ten years that Israel is about to receive. Also, past presidents have also supported resolutions condemning Israeli settlements, including Ronald Reagan.Perhaps Netanyahu should have respected President Obama instead of insulting him repeatedly over the years like when he delivered an address to Congress rebuking him for working with Iran to reduce their nuclear development. Let s keep in mind that President Obama succeeded in getting Iran to the table and both sides were able to come to a diplomatic agreement. Iran is now complying by giving up their centrifuges. If Netanyahu had his way, we would be at war with Iran, something he can now talk Trump into actually doing.If Netanyahu really wanted peace talks, he would have halted the settlements years ago. But Netanyahu and his right-wing government have no interest in peace. They have become frighteningly similar to the Nazis over the years as they kill Palestinians indiscriminately and advocate genocide against them. One would think that a people whose history is full of tragedies like the Holocaust would avoid trying to commit one themselves. But Netanyahu has dragged Israel to the extreme right-wing.Now Netanyahu is about to have Trump by his side, an egomaniac who hates Muslims as much as he does, which could mean the restart of perpetual war in the Middle East for our military or worse since Trump is obsessed with using nuclear weapons.So it looks like Putin isn t the only foreign leader who got a puppet in the White House. Israel did, too. And the world could be set on fire if we continue letting Israel bully us.Featured image via Press TV",News,"December 23, 2016"
20415,“MODERATE” MUSLIM SILENCE? Neighbors: “They Kept To Themselves…They Did Not Wear Religious Garb”…PEOPLE WHO KNEW HIM: “He Expressed Support For Terror Groups”,"If the Muslim terrorist who killed 49 people and wounded several others in a gay nightclub in Orlando had been scouting out Disneyworld and other possible soft targets in the Orlando area, why is this the first time we are hearing about it? Did his Muslim wife have her mouth taped shut? If friends are now coming forward to tell authorities that the Ft. Pierce terrorist had expressed support for terror groups, why didn t they contact the FBI before he committed a horrific  act of terror in America?  And finally, if the Ft. Pierce terrorist, who was clearly making incendiary statements, was visiting nations who fund the campaigns of United States Presidential candidates like Hillary Clinton, and have a history of supporting terror groups, should the FBI be held accountable, or should every US citizen demand the people who knew he posed a danger, but kept silent be held accountable?  Meanwhile, Barack Hussein Obama blames America and uses this horrific tragedy to trash Donald Trump and to promote his final, (and maybe most important) action that would prove his disdain for America and our Constitution GUN CONTROL.Orlando gunman Omar Mateen s two trips to Saudi Arabia, one of which was a pricey package that included four-star accommodations and fancy meals, were highly unusual and may have been cover for terror training, according to experts.The FBI is piecing together Mateen s radical Islam roots, and the trips to Saudi Arabia could be a sign of his growing religious devotion. His stated reason for both the 2011 and 2012 trips was umrah, a Muslim pilgrimage to the Kingdom that is not as significant as the hajj, a trip all Muslims must make to Mecca at least once in their lives. Either or both of the trips could also have included a side trip. It s very possible for someone to take a trip to a country like Saudi Arabia and declare it as their destination when it is in actuality just a pit stop to a different country like Yemen,  said Ryan Mauro, national security analyst for Clarion Project, a New York-based research institute that tracks global terrorism.  Based on his blatant extremism and ties to a convicted Orlando imam known for facilitating international jihadists traveling, the strong likelihood is that these trips were not benign. Mateen, 29, killed 49 people and wounded 53 inside the gay nightclub Pulse early Sunday, holding dozens hostage for hours before a SWAT team stormed the building and killed him in a gun battle. While holding captives, Mateen made multiple calls to 911, professing his allegiance to ISIS and support for the Muslim brothers who bombed the 2013 Boston Marathon, police said.When Mateen aligned himself with terrorists is not yet clear, but his trips to Saudi Arabia would have put him within a day s drive of Yemen, where Al Qaeda on the Arabian Peninsula has long had a large presence, and where ISIS also has gained a foothold in recent years. Several radicalized Americans have traveled to Yemen to train in terror camps.Mateen s first trip to Saudi Arabia was for 10 days, and the jaunt a year later was for eight. The 2011 trip was arranged by U.S.-based Islamic travel agency Dar El Salam and was a package the company calls the  Sacred Caravan Umrah. The package costs up to $4,000 and is generally comprised of four nights at four-star accommodations in Mecca and six nights in Medina, complete with buffet meals, sightseeing and religious studies and lectures.The travel agency did not respond to a request for comment.The second trip included a stop in the United Arab Emirates, but the exact itinerary of either trip is not known. The FBI, which searched Mateen s condominium in Fort Pierce, Fla., overnight Sunday and into Monday morning, taking a computer and several other items, declined to comment on what investigators may have learned about Mateen s travels.Muslim leaders said it was unusual for Mateen to have made two visits to Saudi Arabia in consecutive years   the first when he was just 24.Okay so why didn t anyone report his trips to the FBI??? It s not cheap to do so and people that young usually don t go twice,  said Adnan Khan, former leader of the Council of Pakistan-American Affairs.  And especially considering he appeared not to have come from a staunchly religious background. Okay so why didn t anyone report his trips to the FBI??? A single trip to Saudi Arabia could be attributed to the mandatory hajj or umrah, but the second trip and the visit to the UAE suggest that his stated reason for traveling was a cover,  he said.  Even if the trip included legitimate religious travel, it does not mean the activity was limited to that. One umrah is usually enough for a Muslim, said Timothy Furnish, an expert in Islamic history and consultant to the Pentagon, The fact that Mateen made two of those would suggest that he felt he had many sins needing rectifying and/or he was not engaged solely in religious activity but meeting with someone in Saudi Arabia,  Furnish said.Mateen was born in New York to Afghan immigrants. People that knew him have said he was not overtly religious, but often expressed anger and a deep hatred of minorities. He had once aspired to be a police officer, was trained with weapons and worked for an international security firm after being fired from a job as a prison guard.The Saudi Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Those Saudi s are quick to react when it comes to writing a check to the Clinton Crime Syndicate/Hillary for President fund though!Neighbors in the quiet condominium complex where Mateen lived with his 3-year-old son and wife, Noor Zahi Salman, said the couple kept to themselves and did not wear religious garb. We were all shocked when we found out,  one neighbor told FoxNews.com.  The most activity I ever saw from the apartment was his girlfriend   or wife   walking to the mailbox and back with their child. However, sources say Mateen had a large collection of Islamic literature in his home, and people who knew him said he had expressed support for various terrorist groups.- FOX NewsWouldn t any sane person knew someone who expressed support for terrorist groups report them to the proper authorities?

11587,PRESIDENT TRUMP Turns C-PAC Into T-PAC: “Era of empty talk is over…I’m Not Representing the Globe; I’m Representing Your Country” [VIDEO],"President Donald Trump returned to CPAC on Friday, receiving a rock star welcome from the packed ballroom.He kicked off the speech defending his statement on Twitter that the media was the  enemy of the people,  vowing to fight their  fake news  stories. A few days ago I called the fake news  the enemy of the people,  and they are. They are the enemy of the people,  he said, criticizing their  dishonest coverage  of his administration.Trump admitted that the media was very upset by his repeated criticisms, but that he would continue to do so, citing the First Amendment. They get upset, they say we can t criticize their dishonest coverage because of the first amendment. They always bring up the First Amendment,  he said.  I love the First Amendment. Nobody loves it better than me. Here are a few of our favorite zingers from his speech: Never underestimate the people never!

6668," Taxpayers Billed $800,000 A Year For Prayers In Congress","American taxpayers are being charged more than $66,000 an hour for prayers said in the US House and Senate.  The total cost per prayer, which lasts an average of 90 seconds, is a whopping $1,659.According to Andrew Seidel of the Freedom From Religion Foundation, who did the math to determine what taxpayers are being charged for prayers in Washington, the total annual bill comes to more than $800,000.Both the U.S. House and Senate employ a chaplain whose singular duty is to administer prayer. The budget for the House Chaplain s office is $345,000, while the Senate Chaplain s office receives $436,886.Seidel reports that both the House and Senate chaplains earn executive level salaries which are equal to those of high-ranking government officials, such as  general counsels of the Departments of the Army, Navy, and Air Force; the chief financial officers of NASA and the EPA; the Chief Information Officers of almost every major federal department and agency; and the Army s Director of Civil Defense. The two chaplains earn three-figure salaries for presiding over opening prayers in the house and senate, which only convene about 135 days out of the year.Seidel reports:And even with those fat salaries, the official chaplains let  guest chaplains  deliver many of the prayers about 40% in the House. The House chaplains gave 1,341 invocations over the 16 years from 2000-2015, or about 84 invocations each year. Guest chaplains gave another 857 over that same span. Congress is budgeting more than three-quarters of a million dollars every year for chaplains to give these prayers or coordinate the guest chaplains  prayers.As Seidel explains here, in 2011 the House Chaplain delivered just 104 prayers, lasting an average of 90 seconds each. That s about 2.6 hours of work. For that he was paid $172,500, or $66,346 an hour.Over the 15-year period between 2000 and 2015, US taxpayers spent $10 million on prayers in Washington. In the meantime, elected officials slashed spending on essential programs like WIC and SNAP as well as other assistance for the vulnerable.The idea that taxpayers are being billed exorbitant amounts of money for prayers, all while right-wing politicians screech about the national debt and wasteful government spending, is beyond outrageous.The church is not government and government is not a church. Everyone is free to exercise their religious beliefs in the U.S. Using millions of dollars in taxpayer money to support daily prayers in Washington, however, is not even close to acceptable.The Freedom From Religion Foundation is encouraging voters to make their voices heard on this issue by contacting their elected representatives here and here.Image credit: Wikipedia",News,"April 27, 2016"
22746,New Survey Shows No.1 Fear of US Citizens is Government NOT Terrorism,"Americans have lost the plot when it comes to evaluating the true nature of the  terrorist threat  (Image Source: Wikicommons)By Matt AgoristAn extensive survey of hundreds of adults across the United States has just revealed that the thing most Americans fear more than anything else is their own government. In fact, according to the survey, no other fear even comes close to the percentage of Americans who worry about their corrupt government officials.The survey was conducted by Chapman University and it serves to back up the point that while Americans claim to live in the Land of the Free, deep down, they realize they are living in a corrupt oligarchy. The Chapman University Survey of American Fears Wave 4 (2017) provides an in-depth examination into the fears of average Americans. In May of 2017, a random sample of 1,207 adults from across the United States were asked their level of fear about eighty different fears across a huge variety of topics ranging from crime, the government, the environment, disasters, personal anxieties, technology and many others. As Statista s Niall McCarthy notes, like last year, corruption of government officials came top in 2017, with 74.5 percent of U.S. adults saying it makes them  afraid  or  very afraid. Despite the constant fear mongering from the mainstream media and government on bogeymen terrorists plotting to steal our freedom, the public, according to this survey, is not buying it.In fact, the threat of terrorism isn t even in the top 20 fears. Terrorism comes in at twenty-two below credit card fraud and identity theft.While this survey is certainly promising, in the idea that people are waking up to government corruption, it is also a telling sign of America s ability to hold two entirely contradictory ideas as self-evident.This ability, or perhaps better defined as  disability,  to hold two opposing ideas, such as the spreading of freedom through war, as being logically sound, is called cognitive dissonance. When one is in a state of dissonance, they may sometimes feel  disequilibrium : frustration, hunger, dread, guilt, anger, embarrassment, anxiety, etc.In order for cognitive dissonance to work, society must remain just ignorant enough to support and to believe the lies fed to them from the establishment as reality; even though this reality is a complete contradiction.Once we step back and observe society with this in mind, the reason for this contradictory mental state becomes quite obvious. It is much easier to remain delusional and in a state of suspended disbelief than it is to deal with the opposing ideas held inside one s head. How can one chant  USA is number #1!  while at the same time fearing the rulers of that USA?( ) If this survey shows us anything, it is that Americans would do well to entertain the uncomfortable idea that this country they hold so high up on a pedestal has actually long been on a path to become the dystopian nightmare written about in books like 1984.Americans would do well to remember the words by John Basil Barnhill in 1914 when he said, Where the people fear the government you have tyranny. Where the government fears the people you have liberty.

11766,USA TODAY SPORTS COLUMNIST Calls For Tom Brady’s Head Over One Thing Found In His Locker…Who Does She Think She Is?,"Just recently, a USA Today sports columnist said New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady deserves  to get some tough questions  on President Trump as his team prepares for the Super Bowl. Tom Brady no longer gets a pass on his friendship with Donald Trump,  wrote Nancy Armour, a veteran sportswriter.  Not after this weekend, when the country boiled over in rage and indignation at Trump s decision to turn America s back on refugees. Armour said the 39-year-old quarterback   who did not campaign with Trump   cannot dismiss his friendship with Trump when he answers questions from the press leading up to Sunday s game against the Atlanta Falcons. It s only now, when he s facing questions and criticism, that he thinks the friendship should be off limits. But it doesn t work that way. If you stake out a position, you need to own it. Or if you ve had a change of heart, explain why,  Armour wrote.The columnist conceded that she doesn t know if Brady is aligned with Trump s perspective or policies, but says he should  disavow  him regardless.  Brady might not agree with Trump s views or his policies   but in refusing to publicly disavow Trump s actions, Brady is giving tacit endorsement to both Trump and the chaos he has created,  she argued.Armour concluded her column by stating that any harsh treatment Brady receives from the press this week is ultimately a situation he created. Regardless of whether he was duped into being a prop or is genuinely friends with Trump, Brady inserted himself into the national firestorm. He can t be surprised that people want to know more. And now expect more,  she writes.Trump and Brady have said they are golfing buddies. Brady was spotted with a  Make America Great Again  hat in his locker shortly after Trump launched his presidential bid. Asked in September 2015 whether he would like to see a Trump White House, Brady said:  It would be great. There would be a putting green on the White House lawn, I can tell you that. But Brady largely avoided answering questions about Trump throughout the race.Read more: The Hill",politics,"Jan 31, 2017"
2004, Trump Staff Hangs Absurdly Offensive Abraham Lincoln Banner In Mar-A-Lago Dining Room,"A few years ago, teenage pop star Justin Bieber angered many people by commenting that he thought Holocaust victim Anne Frank would have been a  belieber.  Today, the 70-year-old President of the United States and his enablers pulled a similarly bone-headed stunt. Bieber was 19 at the time. What s Trump s excuse?Visitors to Trump s Mar-a-Lago resort were shocked to find that over the weekend, his staff hung banners  honoring  Abraham Lincoln by photoshopping a  Make America Great Again  trucker hat onto the former president s head.This is genuinely hanging in Mar-a-Lago for a dinner honoring Lincoln  pic.twitter.com/sRQLtjwBi4  B (@bXbyrne) March 25, 2017The banner went up in conjunction with a Republican Party of Palm Beach County dinner to celebrate  Lincoln Day.  Honoring Lincoln apparently didn t include celebrating his actual accomplishments, but connecting him to Donald Trump.They were so proud of this feat of egomania that they distributed the picture in the dinner program as well.The cover of the 2017 Lincoln Day Dinner program for Republican Party of Palm Beach County tonight at Mar-a-Lago. @WPTV pic.twitter.com/SJPlB8V6qb  Andrew Lofholm (@AndrewLofholm) March 24, 2017The only person who might find this stunt in good taste is Donald Trump   who recently learned that Abraham Lincoln was a Republican. Great president. Most people don t even know he was a Republican. Right? Does anyone know? A lot of people don t know that. We have to build that up a little more. The Florida Republicans hosting the dinner (which, itself, is probably an ethics violation due to the fact that the current president owns the resort and will profit from it) seemed to take Trump s idea and run with it.That s an awfully big dose of wishful thinking. While it s impossible to know what a man who has been dead for 152 years would make of modern life, the idea that he would enthusiastically endorse a race-baiting grifter like Donald Trump is hard to picture. Trump couldn t even get a single living president to support him. Adding to that, the fact that Lincoln is widely regarded as perhaps America s greatest orator only makes it more unlikely that he would be impressed by a guy who can barely string two sentences together coherently.I mean, seriously  look at this garbage: Look, having nuclear my uncle was a great professor and scientist and engineer, Dr. John Trump at MIT; good genes, very good genes, OK, very smart, the Wharton School of Finance, very good, very smart you know, if you re a conservative Republican, if I were a liberal, if, like, OK, if I ran as a liberal Democrat, they would say I m one of the smartest people anywhere in the world it s true! but when you re a conservative Republican they try oh, do they do a number. It s not exactly  Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. If Lincoln were alive today, he would probably have a really articulate, beautiful way of saying  Donald Trump, go screw yourself.  I ll have to settle for saying it as plainly as that.Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images",News,"March 25, 2017"

8562, WATCH Tina Fey’s Triumphant Return To SNL As Crazy Sarah Palin Endorsing Trump,"Tina Fey once again took on Sarah Palin on Saturday Night Live, and as always, it was a gutbuster.Fey opened the January 23 edition of the comedy show with the  cold open,  appearing as Palin next to Darrell Hammond s always-on-point rendition of Donald Trump. The two were re-enacting Palin s bizarre endorsement of Trump from earlier in the week.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfDKKe04sBQIntroducing her, Trump said,  I hope nobody s allergic to nuts, because we got a big one here. Palin then launched into a monologue eerily reminiscent of the real thing, freestyle rhyming about the Americans she supposedly is representing as part of the Trump trainwreck.Palin explained,  I belong in [Trump s] cabinet.  Cause I m full of spice, and I ve got a great rack. In a moment made for social media, Fey/Palin also spoke in tongues, shooting off her finger guns:Speaking for most of America, Trump noted,  She s crazy, isn t she? Fey of course also appeared in a version of Palin s blinding blouse from the event, and many observers on social media pointed out that in addition to the shocking visual similarity between the two women, Fey had once again nailed Palin s accent and bizarre language.In 2008, Fey s impression of Palin set the comedy world on fire and SNL s ratings skyrocketed. The failed vice presidential candidate and half-term governor was repeatedly a source of material for the premiere satirical program in America, with her assertion that she read  all  of the media, and that Alaska provided a vantage point for oversight of Russia s Vladimir Putin.Palin recently tried to return the favor, appearing as Fey in a sketch for a conservative website, but despite the visual similarities, the skit mostly fell flat. Instead of going for the joke, as Fey has on SNL, Palin chose to promote a political message about  political correctness  and  safe spaces. Featured image via Twitter",News,"January 24, 2016"
4288, That Time Donald Trump Said Bill Clinton Was The ‘Victim’ Of ‘Unattractive Women’,"Donald Trump is pledging to bring up Bill Clinton s sexual prowess at the second presidential debate. Now that Trump is in the hot seat over a hot mic leak that shows him gleefully admitting to sexual assault, he does what he knows best   deflect.In his half assed apology, Trump took responsibility for his comments, saying that a video from 10 years ago does not reflect the  man  he is now, but said Bill Clinton has done  much worse  and that Hillary Clinton was complacent in bullying and intimidating his victims.So that  the Trump strategy   deflect from his admissions of sexual assault by drumming up sins of Bill Clinton from the 1990s to smear Hillary (because women just love it when the wife is blamed for the husband s misgivings). There s only one teeny tiny problem with that, though.I don t necessarily agree with his victims. His victims are terrible. He is really a victim himself. But he put himself in that position.That s Donald Trump, in August 1998, calling Bill Clinton the real victim. In an interview with Fox News  Neil Cavuto, the billionaire mogul also trashed Monica Lewinsky, Linda Tripp and Lucianne Goldberg as a  really unattractive group  and an  unattractive cast of characters. The transcripts are as followed:The whole thing, it s just so unattractive. Linda Tripp may be one of the most unattractive human beings I ve ever seen not women, human beings. She s just an unattractive person. This [Lucianne] Goldberg person, her agent or whatever she is, is just a terrible woman. You look at Paula Jones, I mean the whole cast of characters. It s like it s from Hell. It s a terrible group of peopleBut Trump wasn t finished insulting their personal appearances:The whole group, it s truly an unattractive cast of characters Linda Tripp, Lucianne Goldberg I mean, this woman I watch her on television, just vomiting. She is so bad. The whole group Paula Jones, Lewinsky it s just a really unattractive group. And I m not just talking about physical, but I am also talking about physical.Trump then went on to say that had Lewinsky and Jones been  supermodels,  they would be  more pleasant to watch. Once again, Trump proves that he does not care about women unless they are visually appealing (which is completely subjective).But now, all of a sudden, he s their unsung hero against  abuser  Bill Clinton and his enabling wife, Hillary?Gee, what changed?If one thinks Trump truly cares about Jones, Lewinsky, Brodderick, Flowers or any of Clinton s alleged victims, they should keep in mind that Trump only cares about their appearances   and their appearances discount them   and he thinks Bill is the real victim.Do not be deceived America.

This time was a different story. Trump supporters came prepared for the unprovoked attacks of these hate groups and took them to task. With all the violence that happened yesterday, leftist media outlets seemed to be obsessed with reporting on the video that was taken of an alleged Trump supporter who punched an antifa female who was part of the violent group  Oak Roots Collective  that traveled to Berkeley to confront Trump supporters and shut down their right to free speech.Here s the video. At the 18 second mark you can see the woman cock her arm back as though she is about to swing her arm at someone. When she brings her arm forward, that is where she gets hit.

22478,Not a Journalist: CNN’s Brian Stelter Manages Clinton Health Cover-up,"21st Century Wire says CNN s Brian Stelter hosts a show facetiously titled,  Reliable Sources , where Stelter pretends to be a hard-hitting  journalist , but the reality couldn t be further from the truth. Based on CNN and Stelter s reporting so far, their only  sources  appear to be those of the Clinton campaign s damage control team. IMAGE: CNN s Brian Stelter host of  Reliable Sources . Normally, Stelter, who describes himself as a  media analysis expert , is able to play the part of journalist partly because it s easy to blend in at CNN which probably employs more political operatives and pseudo-journalists than any other media outlet in the US, but in the high stakes game that is the 2016 election season, Stelter s cardboard facade has quickly fallen apart, in full view. Buckling under pressure while trying to manage Clinton campaign messaging on CNN, Stelter then lost it, attacking two leading nationally syndicated radio hosts, Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh, accusing them of wanting Hillary Clinton  dead,  (yes that s right, he said dead) during the nationally aired PBS Charlie Rose segment with fill-in host Andrew Ross Sorkin.Listen to the rebuttal by Rush Limbaugh: The HillMedia reporters are a relatively new breed. A breed that basically came along during the last decade when digital media came into existence, creating hundreds of more avenues for actual reporting to exist, and therefore keep an eye on.The job of media reporter is fairly straightforward: Observe the industry in all of its forms. And when good or bad reporting happens, simply call it out.If a police force is a parallel of the Fourth Estate, a media reporter exists in that context as Internal Affairs, as a check and balance for those who are supposed to speak truth to power.But lately it appears that even Internal Affairs/media reporters are compromised, biased and even dishonest. Exhibit A is CNN s Brian Stelter in his reporting on Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton s health issues, or per his consistent narrative for weeks, total lack of issues.Sunday was an active news day well outside of coverage of the 15th anniversary of 9/11: Clinton left a ceremony at Ground Zero early. And Fox News s Rick Leventhal   as solid a news reporter as they come out there   first went to air of Clinton s unexpected departure.From there, Leventhal was alone in his report citing a Clinton health episode for leaving early. The Clinton campaign wasn t talking. Other news organizations were waiting for another outlet or the campaign to come forward to verify before even cautiously broaching it.But shortly after 11:00 a.m. on CNN, Stelter broke away from his planned segment on  Reliable Sources  to break the news, via CNN s Jeff Zeleny, that Clinton had indeed become  overheated  during the 9/11 event under comfortable conditions (76 degrees at the time, mild breeze, low humidity).Here is video of Clinton attempting to enter her secure vehicle: Sunday RCP headline: CNN s Stelter to Media: Do Not Give Oxygen To  Conspiracy Theories  That Hillary Clinton Is  Secretly Ill BRIAN STELTER, RELIABLE SOURCES: Very worrisome news to hear, obviously, Jeff. As someone who covers the Clinton campaign everyday, what can you tell us about how frequently Clinton may have any health issues. Because obviously for years, there have been conspiracy theories online promoted by conservative websites saying that she is secretly ill. The campaign denied that and her physician said she is fit to serve as president. JEFF ZELENY, CNN: Indeed, her physician said she is fit to serve as president. She s released more medical information than her rival has of course but still has not released all of her records that all candidates have had over the years.Now, this certainly is going to prompt and renew and raise more questions about her health potentially here. She is 68 years old. She will turn 69 in October, before election day. It has, you know, we have seen it a lot over recent weeks, you know, some selected images and pictures and video of her either stumbling  BRIAN STELTER: Taken out of context.ZELENY: Taken out of context, yes. And I can tell you, Brian, I cover her a lot day in and day out on the campaign trail. Her schedule is very aggressive. We hear Donald Trumpoften saying,  Oh, she is taking a nap in the middle of the day.  That s not true. She has a very rigorous campaign schedule.( ) Stelter later connected with Zeleny for the following exchange   which had nothing to do with the episode Clinton experienced on Sunday that showed her knees buckling while falling into her security van with aides catching her before potentially injuring herself   around an older tabloid photo instead of discussing the situation at hand.Translation: Nothing really to see here, so let s deflect the conversation to a completely irrelevant point.STELTER:  You know, they had that horrible   let s be honest, Jeff, they had this horrible photo on the cover of that supermarket tabloid. Clearly, Hillary was Photoshopped in the picture. I thought it was disgusting.And yet, even though there are these conspiracy theories, which we should not give oxygen to, saying that she is secretly ill, suggesting she is on her deathbed, which we can she is not, there are legitimate questions to ask by reporters. And I think that s the distinction here to make.ZELENY: Right. It is a distinction, no doubt about it. Like I said, she has released more information than Donald Trump has, but both of them have released far less than John McCain did and Barack Obama did, than Mitt Romney and Barack Obama did, going back much beyond that.But the picture on the tabloid did looked doctored. I see her most every day. That looked nothing like her. And she has joked about it, Brian. I think we saw her on TV STELTER: Yes, good point.ZELENY:   a couple weeks ago saying, you know, look, they ve predicted that I would be on my deathbed by October and I m still here. So she has made humor of this. And I think that this could go one of two ways here. If the other   if her critics keep this up and criticize her, this could certainly motivate and inspire some of her supporters as well here.But we see her waving there, again. She s scheduled to go to California tomorrow. She will be on the West Coast for three days this week. As of now, her schedule is going forward here, Brian.On Thursday, for example, I flew with her all day as she left the airport in Westchester around 10:00 a.m. after a press conference and we returned at 11:00 p.m. She had a couple different campaign stops, a couple different fundraising stops and working along the way. So she is keeping up a rigorous pace here.But there are going to be questions about her health. In this incident, this episode, this situation this morning in Manhattan is just the latest example of that. The fact the Clinton campaign putting out this statement this morning saying that she felt overheated at Ground Zero and was taken to her daughter s apartment certainly is the information we have right now at this hour, Brian. The report would end there.The trip to California has since been cancelled.Takeaway: Stelter never broaches during any of these live reports   big ones considering the news here   that other prominent doctors, including President Obama s ex-physician of more than two decades   made the recommendation recently that Clinton should take a neurological exam.Obama s physician, who gave him a clean bill of health before the 2008 election and is widely respected, was Dr. David Scheiner from 1987 until his election in 2008. Scheiner isn t a Trump fan, but instead a Clinton supporter who said the Republican nominee  scares the devil out of him. There are a number of questions I have,  said Dr. Scheiner to CNN s Erin Burnett in mid-August.  First of all, she s also 68 years old, and while I think that letter was well-written and very professional, unlike Dr. Bornstein s [Donald Trump s doctor], it s not enough. For example, she s on Coumadin, a medication to prevent blood clots,  he continued.  You have to monitor that and it says she s being monitored regularly. I d like to know how well she s being controlled. That s a difficult drug to use. But here s the part Stelter   a media reporter whose job it is to present the full story   has curiously omitted in his numerous television appearances pontificating on the topic of Clinton s health which he has continually dismissed as conspiracy theories: Also, I think she should have had a neurological examination, a thorough neurological examination in 2016,  recommended Scheiner.  We know what happens to football players who have had concussions, how they begin to lose some of their cognitive ability, I think both [Trump and Clinton] should release their records. On Twitter, I asked Stelter   who had repeatedly made the argument that any questions raised about Clinton s health status are strictly those of Drudge, Fox s Sean Hannity, Breitbart and the alt-right   why he has ignored the prognosis of the president s own ex-physician who made said recommendation on CNN primetime to much press reaction afterward:@brianstelter The former ex-physician of the president saying Hillary Clinton should have a neurological exam on CNN air is cherry-picking?  Joe Concha (@JoeConchaTV) September 11, 2016In reviewing transcripts of several Stelter appearances on the topic, the media reporter and critic not only has failed to present Dr. Scheiner s conclusion, but also none of the other top doctors who have come forward to state Clinton needs further medical analysis, scrutiny and transparency as well   and there are plenty to cite.Short version: The  conspiracy theories  that Stelter has characterized in the form of reporting dozens of times on air and in print around Clinton s health had gone well beyond right-wing media and Trump surrogates before Sunday s episode and should have been a legitimate concern worthy of questioning, as noted several times in this space over the past few weeks Continue this story at the HillREAD MORE ABOUT PROBLEMS AT CNN NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire CNN Files",US_News,"September 16, 2016"
5527," Joe Walsh: Americans Are Too Dumb To Understand Obama, So They’re Killing Cops (VIDEO)","Former Republican Congressman Joe Walsh appeared on CNN this week where he defended a tweet that he posted threatening President Obama and the Black Lives Matter Movement.  This is now war. Watch out Obama. Watch out black lives matter punks. Real America is coming after you,  Walsh tweeted after the shooting in Dallas that resulted in the deaths of five police officers on Thursday.During the appearance, Walsh insisted that he was not trying to incite violence towards President Obama. Yeah. Oh, absolutely, because I stand by what I meant, Don,  Walsh said.  I didn t intend to say everybody go threaten Barack Obama or incite violence against Barack Obama. I don t know of a sane person that would do that. That s not what I meant, Don. Walsh then went on to blame Obama for the deaths of the officers killed in Dallas. Because I m pissed off, a lot of Americans are pissed off, and a lot of police officers around the country are upset because there really is a war on our cops and a lot of police officers believe that it started with Barack Obama,  Walsh explained.  The last couple of years, Barack Obama has done nothing but hate on cops. Accusing cops of being bad and racist. But that s not accusing cops of being racist,  Lemon replied.  He s actually pointing out a fact there is systemic racism in this country and there are police departments that need to be reformed. Walsh then went on to say that most Americans   himself excluded of course   are just simply too dumb to understand what President Obama has said regarding his public statements on systemic racism in the criminal justice system. When he said there s systemic racism in the police department after the Minneapolis shooting, he s telling people on the streets that police officers are racist. Now, maybe you and I can make that distinction, but when people on the street hear the President of the United States time after time say that there is racism in police departments all over the country, man, that kind of hating leads to what you got in Dallas. Yeah, because  This is now war, Real America is coming after you,  is such a loving statement to make. Maybe if has-been Tea Party politicians such as Walsh didn t say things like  Obama has done nothing but hate on cops  repeatedly on social media and on television, then those  average people  might not be so quick to jump to the conclusion that President Obama hates police officers. You would think that a self-identifying above average person like Walsh would understand that.You can watch the segment below.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmENSX7lQigFeatured image from video screenshot",News,"July 10, 2016"

What leftist hack Katie Couric doesn t mention is that the protesters who sprayed her producers with urine were actually ANTIFA protesters. By leaving that little factoid out of her tweet, she has clearly attempted to mislead anyone reading her tweet into believing that the offending protesters were part of the white nationalist group. While we strongly condemn any group that believes they are superior because of their race or skin color, these people actually obtained a permit to protest, and until Antifa showed up, their protest was peaceful.Two of my producers just got sprayed with urine.

21610,PARENT FURIOUS AFTER 4TH GRADE CLASS JOINS HATEFUL PROTESTORS AND TEACHER IN CHANT ON CAPITOL STEPS: “[Governor] Walker Sucks!”,"The children were greeted at the Capitol steps in the communist state of Wisconsin by protestors singing hate songs with signs that read: Republicans and Walker rape or molest women and girls.APPLETON, Wis.   I don t frequent the Capitol building in Madison so I just assumed the  Capitol Singers,  a group protesting Governor Scott Walker in song had faded away.I learned recently however that they are, as a line censored out of the sitcom  Last Man Standing  said of the Clintons,  They re like shingles; just when you think they are gone, they pop back up. I received an email recently from a listener to my radio show who chaperoned a field trip his daughter s 4th grade class at Horizons Elementary School in Appleton took to the State Capitol in late May. The story he shared was simply stunning:Everyone on the field trip to the capitol was eating lunch on the capitol steps. At the same time there was a group of people protesting Walker and Act 10 singing hate songs and holding up signs saying that Republicans and Walker rape or molest women and girls.Another parent pointed out to me that my daughter s teacher was down there singing with them. I thought that I needed to find out what was actually being sung down there because a bunch of students were down there listening and recording on their cell phones what was happening. That is when I realized that they were singing terrible hate songs against Walker and what the signs said.By the way, her teacher was holding a piece of paper with the words they were singing on it. When the kids were on their way back up they started chanting  Walker sucks  and some other mean things. That s when I stopped them and asked why they were doing that and they didn t know what to say. I asked three times and one of the boys spoke up and said that Mr. Niquette was just doing it also. That is my daughter s teacher.Feeling it inappropriate to confront the teacher in front of children, the parent contacted the school to see if such behavior violated school policy. He ended up in an email exchange with the teacher, Scott Niquette:Scott, my issue is you going down there and singing with those people on the field trip.Did you see the signs they were holding? I m guessing that you saw the words you were reading off the sheet you were holding. Do you understand what the children were doing after they saw you down there singing? Scott there is video of you singing that hate Walker song.When the kids were walking back up the hill they were chanting hate speech toward Walker until I stopped them and asked them why. The answer was obvious. Someone with influence in their lives was doing the same thing. You have influence on these children and they trust that you will lead them. For crying out loud Scott those signs were way inappropriate. Talking about molesting children and raping women.In a show of Olympian chutzpah, Niquette pleaded ignorance in his response:With respect to the Capitol Singers, I joined them during my lunch break simply because I enjoy singing. I am currently an active member in our church s choir  I honestly did not see or notice any signs regarding molesting children or raping women when I entered the circle of singers. If I had, I can assure you that a most certainly would have immediately left. Again, I joined them simply because I enjoy singing. With respect to my teaching, I also take that very seriously and take great offense to accusations that I do not  You have visited my classroom on numerous occasions and sat in on a few lessons. What did you see and hear I stick to the objectives and leave the politics out.He couldn t resist joining a group of Scott Walker haters in public but we re supposed to trust he keeps politics out of the classroom? He didn t see what the signs said? He was unclear of the lyrics he was singing off a sheet?I reached out to Horizons principal Karen Brice. Initially she told me she hadn t heard of the incident and frankly found it hard to believe. But she told me she would look into it. A few days later she called me back, saying only that school officials were investigating to determine whether district policy had been violated.Then there is this classic line from Niquette in his email response to the parent:In retrospect, however, I do think I will save singing with the Capitol Singers for a time when I am at the capitol of my own accord to better reduce any opportunities of misunderstanding.Via: EAG News",left-news,"Jun 29, 2015"
950, Twitter Is Working On The Biggest F*ck You To Trump And You’re Going To Love It (DETAILS),"Many Americans have been begging Donald Trump to delete his Twitter account for the sake of the country s reputation, and Twitter might have actually found a way to make him quit the social media platform for good!In an effort to combat  fake news , Twitter is developing a feature that will allow its users to flag tweets that contain false or harmful information   which pretty much describes every tweet that Trump posts. Twitter s Vice President of Policy, Colin Crowell, stated that Twitter is working hard to detect spammy behaviors We ve been doubling down on our efforts. This feature is currently in the prototype phase, and is being noted as Twitter s most aggressive attempt yet to maintain the integrity of the content that appears on its platform. According to the Washington Post, this feature would work as a small tab in a drop-down menu next to tweets. According to two anonymous sources, Twitter is still testing and researching this function carefully, as there are concerns that legitimate information could also be censored if this feature could be manipulated.This might not only kill Trump s tweets, but it will also have a major effect on his audience. Trump loves to brag about how big his following is on Twitter, yet third-party service Twitter Audit states that over half (59%) of Trump s audience is comprised of fake accounts or bots.While this feature is very much in the early phases and there is no guarantee that it will definitely be implemented, this is big news for Trump s presidency. And while the company hasn t said anything about targeting Trump with this initiative, one can only wonder as we recall the words of Twitter s co-founder, Evan Williams: It s a very bad thing, Twitter s role in that.

8859, Bundy Terrorists Claim God Told Them To Act Like Toddlers And Take Over Wildlife Refuge,"Ammon Bundy and his wayward crew of temper tantrum-throwing white guys with guns are now claiming that God talked to them and told them to seize the federal wildlife refuge.On Friday, Bundy told a meeting of fellow right-wing domestic terrorists that he refuses to end the occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge because  the Lord  told him to go there in the first place. I was asked to do this by the Lord. I did it how he told me to do it. It sounds like Bundy and his band are suffering from a form of mental illness. Because the Mormon church that Bundy is a member of sure doesn t agree with him.In a statement earlier this month, officials from the Church of Latter-day Saints rejected Bundy s claim that his seizure of federal property had anything to do with religion. Church leaders strongly condemn the armed seizure of the facility and are deeply troubled by the reports that those who have seized the facility suggest that they are doing so based on scriptural principles. This armed occupation can in no way be justified on a scriptural basis. Exactly, and that is why we can no longer tolerate this armed occupation. Bundy and his pals are committing treason and domestic terrorism. They have illegally carried guns on federal property, along with breaking and entering and threatening violence against federal officials. They have forced the town of Burns to live in fear as schools and businesses are closed to avoid putting innocent children and adults in harm s way.If Bundy and his group were a bunch of armed black people or Muslims, federal and local law enforcement would have already riddled the building with bullets on the first day and Ammon Bundy would look like Swiss cheese.But because these guys are white rednecks with guns, law enforcement is giving them free reign to do as they please. Bundy thinks him and his buddies should be able to walk free when this is all over and they assume the government will give in to their demands. If that were to happen, nothing will stop these terrorists from becoming more emboldened in the future. Perhaps they ll set their sights on the Capitol building or the White House next.This armed takeover has been totally unjustified from the very beginning. Not only have Dwight and Steven Hammond, the arsonist ranchers whom Bundy says he is fighting for, rejected his cause, history and the law are firmly against him as well.Bundy claims the federal government stole the land from ranchers, but that is far from the case.According to Oregon Live, the federal government has legally held the title to all public lands in Oregon since it was a territory. After exhaustive research, the Supreme Court also ruled in 1902 and 1935 that this is the case. Furthermore, ranchers have willingly sold and been paid fair value for their land by the federal government to expand the wildlife reserve over the years.In short, the Bundys do not have religion, history, nor the law on their side. They are terrorists, pure and simple, and they need to be arrested and thrown in prison, or treated just like we have treated terrorists in the Middle East, who ironically enough also claim religion justifies their cause.Featured Image: WMUR",News,"January 9, 2016"

2896, WATCH: Former Clinton Aide BLASTS Lying Sean Spicer; Says He Should Resign,"The internet has been destroying the Trump administration s press secretary, former Republican National Committee mouthpiece Sean Spicer. As everyone now knows, Spicer spent his very first press briefing lying about Trump s inaugural crowd size as compared to those of President Barack Obama. Of course, we all know that President Obama s 2009 crowd size reached historic numbers, exceeding one million people. When comparison photos were tweeted out, this was clearly just too much for Trump s fragile ego, so he sent Spicer out to rag on the press for reporting, well, facts about Trump s pathetic crowds.Well, since this administration clearly has no issue with lying straight to the faces of the American people, Brian Fallon, the former press secretary for Hillary for America, went on CNN to weigh in on what he would have done had he ever been put in the position of lying to the American public regarding this or anything else. Fallon said: There s clear intent. It was a lie. It should be called a lie. And if he was put in the situation by [Chief of Staff] Reince Priebus or his boss, Donald Trump, to go out and tell a lie to the American people, he should have resigned rather than go out and take the podium. Spicer, of course, lied through his teeth, and said, as he blasted the press: This was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period, both in person and around the globe. This is simply untrue, and there are photos and numbers to prove it. But the ease of fact-checking such a thing matters not to the Trump White House. In fact, while speaking to NBC s Chuck Todd on Sunday, Kellyanne Conway called Spicer s lies  alternative facts,  as if refusing to call them what they are lies makes everything just a-okay.Fallon continued, saying that he s never been asked to do any such thing, but he hoped he wouldn t do what Spicer did after being asked by CNN s Brian Stelter what he d have done if he were asked to lie like that: But I d like to think that if I ever was, I would have too much integrity to go out and look in the cameras and say something that was provably false. Then again, Brian Fallon would never be in such a position, because a) Hillary would never ask her staff to do such a thing because she s not a petulant brat like Trump is, and b) she wouldn t need to, because her inaugural crowds would have reached record highs as well.Too bad we ll never know what could have been, and we re stuck with this orange moron for at least four years.Watch the exchange below:[ad3media campaign= 1422 ]Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"January 22, 2017"
22879,What’s the Leading Killer of American Adults Under 50? Drug Overdose.,"21st Century Wire says Last April, the UN general assembly met to discuss how the world s nations can  combat the global drug problem.  It was just the latest non-event in a long line of categorical failures, led by the United States. Ever since US president Richard Nixon declared the  War on Drugs  in 1971, the international narcotics trade has grown from strength to strength, in a black global market that is now worth hundreds of billions of dollars per year. After Nixon, other US presidents tried to champion the issue, from Reagan to Clinton, Bush and Obama. Each of them presided over one epic failure after another. However, where long-term data is available, it does point to systematic failures in drug policies. A study published in the British Medical Journal in 2013 found that despite efforts to limit the supply of these drugs, since 1990 prices have fallen while the purity of the drugs has increased. The trends were similar in the US and in Europe. The authors  conclusion was clear:  These findings suggest that expanding efforts at controlling the global illegal drug market through law enforcement are failing.  (The Guardian)As a direct result of the policies of western governments led by the US, and their corrupt accomplices in the international banking, UN and NGO sectors  in 2017, cheaper, newer and more deadly drugs continue to ruin families and communities, and millions of lives in the new western underclass and youth population Zero HedgeThe opioid crisis that is ravaging urban and suburban communities across the US claimed an unprecedented 59,000 lives last year, according to preliminary data gathered by the New York Times. If accurate, that s equivalent to a roughly 19% increase over the approximately 52,000 overdose deaths recorded in 2015, the NYT reported last year.Overdoses, made increasingly common by the introduction of fentanyl and other powerful synthetic opioids into the heroin supply, are now the leading cause of death for Americans under 50. And all evidence suggests the problem has continued to worsen in 2017. One coroner in Western Pennsylvania told a local newspaper that his office is literally running out of room to store the bodies, and that it was recently forced to buy a larger freezer.The initial data points to large increases in these types of deaths in states along the East Coast, particularly Maryland, Florida, Pennsylvania and Maine. In Ohio, which filed a lawsuit last week accusing five drug companies of abetting the opioid epidemic, the Times estimated that overdose deaths increased by more than 25 percent in 2016.In some Ohio counties, deaths from heroin have virtually disappeared. Instead, the primary culprit is fentanyl or one of its many analogues. In Montgomery County, home to Dayton, of the 100 drug overdose deaths recorded in January and February, only three people tested positive for heroin; 97 tested positive for fentanyl or another analogue.In some states in the western half of the US, data suggest deaths may have leveled off for the time being   or even begun to decline. Experts believe that the heroin supply west of the Mississippi River, traditionally dominated by a variant of the drug known as black tar which is smuggled over the border from Mexico, isn t as easily adulterated with lethal analogues as the powder that s common on the East Coast Continue this story at Zero HedgeREAD MORE WAR ON DRUGS NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire War on Drugs FilesSUPPORT OUR WORK BY SUBSCRIBING & BECOMING A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV ",Middle-east,"June 8, 2017"

22875,SYRIA: British and American Presence Directly Escalating Conflict Near Al-Tanf," US paratrooper on security duty during a mission to train Iraqi forces (Photo: US Department of Defense. Source: Wikicommons)21st Century Wire says In southeastern Syria, the region around al-Tanf has quickly become a focal point for the ongoing conflict in the region. Near to both the Iraqi and Jordanian borders, al-Tanf is currently the location of a contingent of US-led coalition forces, supposedly there for the purpose of providing training to  anti-ISIS  militias, but also anti-Assad militias too   the fabled  moderate rebels . Not surprisingly, the US-led coalition has unilaterally imposed a self-styled  deconfliction zone  around their camp in al-Tanf and claim to be defending their position from  pro-Syrian forces , otherwise known as the Syrian Arab Army (SAA) and allied militias. It has been reported by mainstream media outlets that coalition members represented at al-Tanf include not only the United States but also the British SAS, and also possibly Norway too.Although coalition forces are also present in other parts of Syria, including the area around Raqqa, an ISIS stronghold, the last few weeks have seen coalition forces striking Syrian military targets on at least three occasions near the coalition training camp close to al-Tanf  including incidents on May 18th, June 6th and June 8th. It is now being reported that the US is supplying  truck-mounted long range missiles  to its forces near al-Tanf, in a move that risks immediate escalation in the already-tense situation, and despite diplomatic efforts by Russia to calm the situation. All this comes as the US and its Kurdish proxy militia, the SDF, mount their attack on the ISIS stronghold Raqqa in Northeast Syria. The US has also seized the opportunity to invade more Syrian territory after an alleged sarin gas attack on April 4th that prompted President Trump to launch a missile strike on a Syrian airbase in retaliation.In the following segment filmed two weeks ago, 21WIRE editor Patrick Henningsen speaks to RT International about the recent US strike on Syrian forces near al-Tanf. Henningsen explains how the US are taking advantage of the tension to secure its own territory inside of Syria:. US and Britain: A Policy of DeceptionOne could easily be confused by the narrative that is being spun by the US, Britain, and compliant mainstream media in both countries. Less than two years ago, in 2015, then British Prime Minister David Cameron ruled out sending British ground troops into Syria. In mid-2016, however, it emerged that British special forces were engaged in combat in the country. Between 2013 and 2015, former US President Barack Obama said on at least 16 occasions that there would be no boots on the ground  in Syria, but then changed his mind in late 2015 when US Special Forces were deployed into Syria.President Trump s statements are no less contradictory. On April 11th 2017, soon after his initial missile strikes on the Syrian airbase, Trump said that the US was  not going into Syria ; the current situation at al-Tanf simply contradicts that statement.Since that time, both Britain and the US have been slowly ramping up their presence in Syria, ostensibly to fight ISIS. But by repeatedly striking at Syrian government forces    the single most effective fighting force against ISIS    the US and Britain are actually helping ISIS to achieve its objectives.Note the mismatch between the US-led coalition s presence in Syria and how it s presented to the public. Not only do they claim to be fighting ISIS while at the same time indirectly helping them, but they also call their attacks on Syrian army targets  defensive   even though the Syrian military has never attempted to attack any coalition forces. And it is similarly ironic that these strikes against the Syrian military have occurred in what the coalition calls a  deconfliction zone , where supposedly no conflict is allowed. According to security analyst Charles Shoebridge: These are self-declared [US occupied] zones of  deconfliction.  What they really mean there is that they are not allowing other people to enter these zones, notwithstanding that this is part of a sovereign country, Syria  What they mean is that actually conflict is allowed, and military forces, as long as they are American, British and their  rebel  allies. They are not agreed deconfliction zones. Syria doesn t agree to them. Russia, which of course has established de-escalation zones elsewhere in the country, hasn t agreed to this. Consequently they really are, as [Russian Foreign Minister] Lavrov or his spokesman said, effectively unilateral zones. And not only is the narrative confusing, it is also not given the highest priority among mainstream headlines, with many other prominent stories conveniently serving to occupy the public while the situation in al-Tanf escalates. In a week that saw Congressmen shot at and injured at a baseball practice, a massive tower block fire in London taking at least 17 lives, and the UK election aftermath continuing to be unresolved, one could easily remain unaware of the escalating situation around al-Tanf in Syria. With the US-led coalition now directly and deliberately attacking Syrian forces, what has been a proxy war is suddenly growing more dangerous, and the prospect of a direct conflict between nuclear-armed powers looms ever closer.As former British Ambassador to Syria Peter Ford remarked during a recent conversation with 21WIRE, the British military has neither Syrian approval to be in Syria, nor international approval from the UN, nor even legislative approval from its own Parliament. The same applies to the United States; although the US Constitution gives the power to declare war exclusively to Congress, the US now has quite a long history of entering wars or using deadly military force without Congressional approval under the flexible guise of an  Authorization of Force. More on this story from Newsweek  Two Syrian army tanks destroyed in a battle against  moderate rebels , Azaz, Syria (Photo: Christiaan Triebert. Source: Wikicommons)Tom O Connor NewsweekRussia has demanded that the U.S. stop attacking forces that support the Syrian government as they overtake positions held by the Islamic State militant group (ISIS) on the country s border with Iraq.Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov reportedly made the comments Saturday on a phone call with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, responding to three U.S. air strikes in the past few weeks against forces battling ISIS and other insurgent groups on behalf of Russian-backed Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The Pentagon has argued that the pro-Syrian government coalition, which it describes as Iran-backed militias, has breached a  deconfliction zone  declared by the U.S.-led international coalition in southern Syria but not recognized by Moscow or Damascus. Lavrov criticized the U.S. s moves, and the pair reportedly agreed to cooperate more closely in the future. Lavrov expressed his categorical disagreement with the U.S. strikes on pro-government forces and called on him to take concrete measures to prevent similar incidents in future,  Russia s Foreign Ministry said in a statement, according to Reuters.While the Syrian army and its allies, which include Russia, Iran and various pro-government militias, advance toward the besieged eastern city of Deir Al-Zour, held by ISIS since 2014, the U.S. has deployed Special Forces to train anti-Assad rebels near the southern region of al-Tanf. Both factions are involved in the battle against ISIS but differ on Syria s political future, with the former insisting that Assad remains in power and the latter mostly advocating for his removal.Continue this story at NewsweekREAD MORE SYRIA NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire SYRIA FilesSUPPORT OUR WORK BY SUBSCRIBING & BECOMING A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",Middle-east,"June 16, 2017"
13206,"NOT KIDDING: Obama’s Weak Immigrant Vetting Process Doesn’t Even Include Asking If They Belong To ISIS, Al Qaeda Or Muslim Brotherhood","This new information just adds more validity Trump s argument, that the US needs to take a more serious look at the way we vet immigrants if we want to protect our national security While State Department and the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service branch of the Department of Homeland Security do ask if immigrants have been involved in terrorism, the most well known of over a dozen terrorist groups aren t listed in applications, according to the analysis from homeland security expert Mark A. Sauter.The form asks if the applicant has ever belonged to a terrorist group, but neglects to ask if they currently belong to one. How hard would that be to update? He said that federal officials told him that the questions about terror group involvement are required by federal law, meaning that congressional action is needed to include modern-day threats in the written questions.However, detailed written questions are asked about Nazi cooperation, as are questions about whether applicants are drunks, polygamists, or Communists. One survey does single out Colombian terror organizations in the written questions, though they have never attacked inside the U.S. The lack of specific questioning about the biggest threat to the United States as the country eyes thousands in line from Syria, Afghanistan, Iran and elsewhere seeking residency raises new questions about how immigrants are vetted, and gives ammunition to Republicans like presidential candidate Donald Trump who has called for  extreme vetting  to weed out likely terrorists.

18389,OMINOUS WARNING TO EUROPEANS: You Are Committing Self-Murder…Life As You Know It Is About To Change…Immigrants Will Bring Their Wars To Your Doorstep [VIDEO],"Douglas Murray, author of The Strange Death Of Europe: Immigration, Identity, Islam gives a stunning account of the  self murder  or Europe in the  Death Of Europe  article published by ExpressUKI have travelled to the places where migrants continue to land and the places where they keep ending up. Everywhere I have gone I have come to the same conclusion: our continent is in the process of self-murder.Amid the day-to-day distraction of life and politics, it is easy to forget this biggest event of our time. All pale into insignificance besides the story of the loss by Europeans of the only place we had to call home.Whenever this country does have a debate about immigration it is minuscule. It tends to focus on Calais. The British public sees footage of people sitting in makeshift tents or hurling missiles into the roads to slow the trucks down so they can board them and break into Britain.Each time actors, celebrities and politicians head to Calais and visit the camp. They return to tell the British public that it must be more open-hearted and generous.The argument they make is humane. It is an understandable reaction to human misery but it is a core part of our society s suicide mission.Take that example of Calais. Before the latest clearance of the camp there were about 6,000 people living there. None of them should have been there.By being there they had already broken every one of the rules that our continent put in place which demands they seek asylum in the first country of arrival. Almost nobody arrives into France first.All these people have landed in Greece or Italy and made their way north.And yet still the celebrities and others pick at our consciences. Can we not be generous and at least let in the people who are there? It is wholly understandable   and also ill-informed madness.Over this year s Easter weekend alone about 8,000 people were picked up between the coast of north Africa and the south of Italy.They were described   as everyone always is   as being  rescued . In fact what happens   what has been happening for years   is that each day boats filled with migrants set out from north Africa.During the heights of the migration crisis of 2015, when Germany s Chancellor Angela Merkel opened up the doors of Europe to the world, the whole continent began to buckle.But in reality that flood of millions into Europe only sped up a process that had been under way for years. Ever since the postwar period European governments had encouraged migrant workers to come in.At first   as Chancellor Merkel herself admitted in a speech in 2010   they expected the workers to return home. But they didn t. They stayed. As did the flow after that and the ones for decades after that.The governments of countries such as ours failed to get anything right. All their predictions were wrong for decades. They were wrong that people would stay for only a short time. Wrong to think that they would not continue to come in large numbers.Wrong that they might not want to bring their extended families to join them. And wrong to think that once the tap was turned on anything but very radical action could ever bring the numbers to a controllable level.During the course of researching The Strange Death Of Europe: Immigration, Identity, Islam, I have travelled to see the places where those migrants who arrive on our continent end up. Last year the migrant crisis was widely believed to have slowed down.But it had not and its effects were still visible everywhere. In the outskirts of Paris I saw hundreds of young sub-Saharan men living in tents in the middle of roadways. The French police would occasionally move them a few hundred feet further along.In remote parts of Sweden areas that used to be filled with Swedes are inhabited instead by the residents of other continents.Still the dream of some Europeans is that the arrivals into Europe will become European. It is more likely that Europe will simply begin to look increasingly Third World.

4979, The Kaiser CEO LOVES Obamacare – Thinks Aetna Did It Wrong,"You ve probably seen the headlines that Aetna, one of the largest providers in the Affordable Care Act exchanges, has pulled out. Critics of Obamacare had nothing but schadenfreude. They told us Obamacare was doomed and this was proof. As it turns out, Aetna s move was less about the viability of Obamacare (as they claimed) than about a personal and political vendetta against the President, whose administration denied a merger between Aetna and Humana.The CEO of one of the largest providers in the network thinks Aetna is completely wrong. Bernard Tyson of Kaiser Permanente thinks Obamacare has been great for his bottom line and that if Aetna was in fact losing money, it was because they were bad at managing it.Tyson does understand that it s a tough market. People have been sicker than anticipated, which makes sense. If you give millions of people who haven t been able to afford medical care medical care, it will take a few years to bring their health up to that of people who have had insurance. Congress hasn t helped either. Republicans have blocked the assistance that was being offered to the insurance companies to help with the transition.But, according to Tyson, that DOES NOT mean that Obamacare is a failure. The idea that I would turn my back on a segment of the American population who really needs the coverage and the care I m in for the long haul,  Tyson said.  And I m cautiously optimistic that at some point, we begin to make sure we have the right regulations, meaning oversight, to make sure the market is behaving like it was intended. Kaiser has made a  slight margin  overall on its ACA plans, Tyson said. Centene Corp., Molina Healthcare and Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida similarly have found ways to make money on the exchanges. Narrow networks of hospital and doctors, as well as high deductibles, have worked for Medicaid plans like Centene and Molina. Florida Blue has relied on higher premiums than its peers.Source: Modern Health Care</blockquote>Another problem is that the insurers themselves may be pricing themselves out of the market because of the *drum roll* free market. There were conscious decisions made in the pricing of the product when it first started that did not hold logic to the marketplace,  Tyson said.  This is not rocket science. There s a pool of people to take care of, there s an underwriting process, and there were decisions made that   I m going to consciously underprice, and what I m going to do is gain market share and over time it s going to work itself out. Here s the full interview. It s quite interesting, and if you live in a Kaiser market, it might be worth supporting them:Featured image via video screen capture. ",News,"August 19, 2016"
428, Trump Brags About Hurricane Size As Florida Braces For Disaster,"Donald Trump is apparently thrilled that Hurricane Irma will be the biggest storm to ever hit the United States.Only weeks after Hurricane Harvey left a swath of devastation and death in Texas, Florida is bracing for an even deadlier and more destructive storm.People will die. Businesses and homes will be wiped off the map. Suffering and homelessness will be the reality in Florida. But Trump is too busy bragging about the size of the hurricane to actually care about the people who are in the path of the storm.In yet another Twitter rant on Wednesday morning, Trump proclaimed that his team is already in Florida preparing for the storm after bragging about what a  good job  they have done in Texas.Watching Hurricane closely. My team, which has done, and is doing, such a good job in Texas, is already in Florida. No rest for the weary!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 6, 2017In fact, Trump s response to Hurricane Harvey was to brag about the size of that storm, and he ended an Obama-era flood policy as Houston drowned. Trump has also proposed massive cuts to FEMA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which predicts and tracks hurricanes.It should also be noted that Trump inherited a FEMA that took the lessons of Hurricane Katrina seriously in preparation for future storms. So, Trump and his team did nothing special.But what Trump did next on Twitter shows just how little empathy and compassion he has for the people in the path of Hurricane Irma.Hurricane looks like largest ever recorded in the Atlantic!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 6, 2017Yeah, you read that right. Trump literally bragged about the size of this hurricane as if it s something to be proud of. This coming from a man who denies the very climate change that is causing bigger and more destructive hurricanes to form.As Floridians prepare for disaster, they must be wondering why Trump is so excited about watching them get slammed by the largest hurricane to ever strike the United States. If anything, Trump should be concerned about the coming destruction and death instead of bragging like he s about to win a prize.Featured Image: Jim Lo Scalzo   Pool/Getty Images",News,"September 6, 2017"

12326,STUDENTS BRAVELY DEFY Catholic College VP’s Warning To Reconsider “Offensive…Divisive…Harmful” AMERICA-THEMED Party,"Student government leaders at Loyola University Maryland faced a barrage of pressure from the university administration to change the theme of a senior class party described as  very alienating, divisive and harmful  and against the university s  core values,  according to emails provided to The Daily Caller. The theme? America.The theme for Loyola s annual  Senior 200s  party   one of four celebrations exclusive to seniors held throughout the year   was based upon a survey of Loyola seniors taken last summer. The party was held on Nov. 18 and went off without a hitch, according to students who attended, despite warnings that the administration might have to get involved if students were offended.Emails sent to student government representatives were provided to TheDC on condition of anonymity. Multiple student government representatives confirmed the emails  authenticity on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation from the administration.Right before the presidential election, some student government members wondered if they should nix the America theme if Donald Trump won, according to internal SGA group chats shared with TheDC on condition of anonymity for the same reason.One representative claimed that  if Trump wins it will be bad,  while another argued it would be wrong to change the party theme simply because of disagreement with the president-elect s policies. The party was still on.The day after Trump s victory, a handful of students messaged SGA representatives to argue that   because of Trump s victory   an America-themed party was now inappropriate. One female student claimed she was  a victim of horrible hate words  and worried that similar mean things might be said at the party if the theme wasn t changed.When the possibility of unpleasant feelings wasn t enough to cancel a class-wide event, the administration got involved.The university s executive vice president, Susan Donovan sent an email to two SGA members claiming she  talked with a number of students and heard from faculty members  about the party.  None of it is positive and it sounds very alienating, divisive and harmful. Sheilah Horton, the university s dean of students also tried to pressure students to change the party theme, in a lengthy email that portrayed the students as insensitive for not canceling the America theme.Horton worried that the theme  provides an opportunity for students to dress or behave in a way that offends or oppresses others. Horton also said the administration would have to  deal with  any fallout from the party, which she worried would make students feel  unsafe.  She also worried that the America-themed party might keep potential students from attending Loyola and implied the event could be the  defining  incident of the senior class. Even one negative event, especially with social media can cause the campus community to feel unsafe; it can be shared with potential students which can have an effect on admissions and indeed can be the defining incident for the class of 2017,  she said. So, you have made a decision that in effect, has the potential to cause negative consequences for the university and even to the students whose behavior crosses the line,  she continued. Horton did not respond to TheDC s request for comment by press time. I was amazed and shocked at not only the reaction and lack of confidence of the administration in our class and SGA itself, but how they handled everything including some of the rude things said about our organization. It is quite disgusting how people feel and see the word  America  as something that is discriminatory,  said one student government representative, who wished to remain anonymous out of fear of retaliation from the administration. We should see the theme  America  as a way to forget political divide and come together as a country and class and celebrate all that we have accomplished. That is what ended up happening, yet we didn t have the support of people in our class and the administration itself.   Daily Caller ",politics,"Nov 22, 2016"
2729," Trump Doubles Down On Being An Ass To Australia, And Twitter BUTCHERS Him (TWEETS)","Trump isn t smart. He s a complete buffoon with a temper that s so short it s virtually nonexistent. But he likes to pretend he s the President of the United States, which means he thinks he s this country s sole leader. As such, he believes he can do and say as he wishes, even if it means alienating people, countries and groups that we need.During a phone call to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, Trump threw a livid fit over an agreement we reached with them under Obama to accept 1,250 refugees. Trump accused Australia of planning to send us  the next Boston bomber,  and promptly hung up. Then, instead of staying quiet or actually (gasp) doing some basic homework and admitting he made a mistake with that, he took to Twitter to double down:Do you believe it?

16911,BARACK OBAMA Finds Friend In “Fundamental Transformation Of America”: Shocking Way Ryan Betrayed Americans With $1.1 Trillion Bill,"Funding for Sanctuary Cities, benefits for illegal aliens, fully funded refugee programs, quadruples number of work visas for foreigners, release of criminal aliens, tax credits for illegal aliens, locking in huge spending increases, making America less safe and more Rep. Paul Ryan s first major legislative achievement is a total and complete sell-out of the American people masquerading as an appropriations bill.Too harsh, you say? Let the programs, the spending, and the implications speak for themselves.(1) Ryan s Omnibus Fully Funds DACAThough much of the public attention has surrounded the President s 2014 executive amnesty, the President s 2012 amnesty quietly continues to churn out work permits and federal benefits for hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens. Paul Ryan s bill funds entirely this 2012 executive amnesty for  DREAMers or illegal immigrants who came to the country as minors.Specifically, Division F of Ryan s omnibus bill contains no language that would prohibit the use of funds to continue the President s unconstitutional program. Obama s executive action, known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), has granted around 700,000 illegal aliens with work permits, as well as the ability to receive tax credits and federal entitlement programs. A recent GAO report documented how this illegal amnesty program for alien youth is, in large part, responsible for the illegal alien minor surge on our southern border.In 2013, Paul Ryan said that it is his job as a U.S. lawmaker to put himself in the shoes of  the DREAMer who is waiting  and work to find legislative solutions to his or her problems.(2) Ryan s Omnibus Funds Sanctuary CitiesFive months ago, 32-year-old Kate Steinle was bleeding to death in her father s arms. She was gunned down in broad daylight by a five-time deported criminal alien whose presence in the country was the direct result of San Francisco s refusal to comply with U.S. immigration law yet Paul Ryan s omnibus rewards these lawless Sanctuary Cities with federal grants. Division B Title II of Ryan s omnibus funds various grant programs for the Department of Justice (pages 167, 168, and 169) and contains no language that would restrict the provision of such grants to sanctuary jurisdictions.In a Congressional hearing, Steinle s father demanded Congressional action and recalled his daughter s dying words:  Help me, Dad. (3) Ryan s Omnibus Funds All Refugee ProgramsDespite broad support amongst Republican lawmakers for a proposal introduced by Rep. Brian Babin (R-TX)to halt all refugee resettlement, Ryan s appropriations bill will fund President Obama s refugee resettlement operation and will allow for the admission of tens of thousands of refugees with access to federal benefits. Division H Title II of Ryan s bill contains appropriations of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and contains no language that would restrict the program. Nor are there any restrictions for the program in Division K of Ryan s bill, which provides funding for the Department of State, which oversees refugee admissions.Ryan is not one of the 84 cosponsors of Babin s bill to halt the refugee operation, and he recently told Sean Hannity that he does not support halting resettlement because,  We re a compassionate country. The refugees laws are important laws.  Similarly, this outcome represents a legislative win for Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), who told Sean Hannity he d  hate to use  Congress s power of the purse to deny funding for Obama s resettlement operation.(4) Ryan s Omnibus Funds All of the Mideast Immigration Programs That Have Been Exploited by Terrorists in Recent YearsAlthough multiple immigrant and visa programs in recent years have been exploited by terrorists (such as the F-1  student  visa, the K-1  fianc e  visa, and our green card and refugee programs), Ryan s proposal does nothing to limit admissions from jihadist-prone regions. As Senators Shelby and Sessions of Alabama noted in a joint statement:  The omnibus would put the U.S. on a path to approve admission for hundreds of thousands of migrants from a broad range of countries with jihadists movements over the next 12 months, on top of all the other autopilot annual immigration. (5) Ryan s Omnibus Funds Illegal Alien ResettlementOn page 917 of Ryan s omnibus a section titled  Refugee and Entrant Assistance  funds the President s resettlement of illegal immigrant border crossers.(6) Ryan s Omnibus Funds the Release of Criminal AliensSenior legislative aides tell Breitbart News that Ryan s bill does not do anything to change the enforcement priorities that Jeh Johnson established a little over a year ago that would shield entire categories of criminal aliens from immigration law, nor does it include language recommended by Sessions and Shelby to  deny the expenditure of funds to issue visas to countries that refuse to repatriate criminal aliens. (7) Ryan s Omnibus Quadruples H-2B Foreign Worker VisasDespite Ryan s pledge not to move an immigration compromise with President Obama, tucked 700 pages into Ryan s spending bill is language that would resuscitate and expand a controversial provision of the Schumer-Rubio Gang of Eight plan to increase the H-2B visa program.The provision  would quadruple the number of H-2B visas for unskilled guest workers, for a total of more than 250,000,  writes immigration attorney Ian Smith. The Americans who fill these jobs are typically  society s most vulnerable   including single women, the disabled, the elderly, minorities, teenagers, students, and first-generation immigrants,  Smith explains.A recent BuzzFeed expos  revealed how this program allows businesses to discriminate against American workers and  deliberately den[y] jobs to American workers so they can hire foreign workers on H-2 visas instead.  As one GOP aide told Breitbart News,  This provision is a knife in the heart of the working class, and African Americans. (8) Ryan s Omnibus Funds Tax Credits for Illegal AliensRyan s bill preserves the expansion of the President s expiring child tax credits without any accompanying language to prevent illegal aliens from receiving those tax credits. While Sen. Sessions attempted to include language in the bill that would prevent illegal immigrants from receiving tax credits, his recommendation was rejected.(9) Ryan s Omnibus Locks-In Huge Spending IncreasesThe bill funds the Obama-Boehner budget deal, which eliminated spending caps, and will increase both defense and non-defense spending next year by $25 billion more each.(10) Ryan s Omnibus Fails to Allocate Funds to Complete the 700-Mile Double-Layer Border Fence That Congress Promised the American PeopleNearly a decade ago with the passage of the 2006 Secure Fence Act, the American people were promised a 700-mile double-layer border fence. However, funding for the fence was later gutted and, as a result, its construction was never completed. Despite heightened media focus over the past six months about Americans  desire for this barrier to illegal entry, Ryan s bill does not require that funds be allocated to finish the construction of the 700-mile double-layer fence.A vote could occur as early as Thursday after midnight, giving lawmakers and the public only one full business day to review the 2,242 page package. The Ryan-Pelosi package represents nothing short of a complete and total betrayal of the American people.Yet Ryan s omnibus serves a second and equally chilling purpose. By locking in the President s refugee, immigration, and spending priorities, Ryan s bill is designed to keep these fights out of Congress by getting them off the table for good. Delivering Obama these wins and pushing these issues beyond the purview of Congress will suppress public attention to the issues and, in so doing, will boost the candidacy of the Republican establishment s preferred presidential contenders, who favor President Obama s immigration agenda.What may prove most discouraging of all to Americans is that recent reports reveal that conservatives in the so-called House Freedom Caucus are praising Ryan even as he permanently locks in these irreversible and anti-American immigration policies. According to Politico, the House Freedom Caucus will  give Ryan a pass  even as he funds disastrous policies that prioritize the interests of foreign nationals and global corporatists above the needs of the American people whom lawmakers are supposed to represent.

1418, Controversial Former Fox CEO Roger Ailes Dead At 77,"It has been reported that embattled former Fox News CEO Roger Ailes passed away this morning at his home in Palm Beach, Florida. The news was confirmed in a statement given to Drudge Report by his wife, Elizabeth Ailes. Elizabeth Ailes  statement on her husband s passing.Roger Ailes was born on May 15th, 1940 in Warren, Ohio. He attended Ohio University and graduated with a bachelor s  degree in radio and television. His long career in television began in 1962 as a production assistant for The Mike Douglas Show, a local talk show. In 1967, Richard Nixon appeared on the program, and Ailes argued with him about the political importance of television. That lead Nixon to hire Ailes to produce television for his campaign. After getting his foot in the door with Nixon, Ailes worked on two other presidential campaigns and helped Rudy Giuliani get elected mayor of New York City. He went on to become the president of CNBC in 1993, before being hired as CEO of Fox News in 1996. Ailes unique style of management and fearless approach to controversy have completely changed conservative broadcasting.Ailes was forced out of Fox News after allegations of sexual harassment came to light by some of the network s most popular and high-profile talent.A 2016 lawsuit by Gretchen Carlson alleges that Ailes retaliated against her for speaking out about his sexist treatment, denying her promotions and stalling her advancement.Megyn Kelly backed up Carlson s version of events, and went public with details of her own sexual harassment by Ailes when she was a young reporter.Lorie Luhn, who booked guests for the network, told of over 20 years of abuse. According her statements to New York Magazine, one time Ailes put her in charge of finding young talent for the network and told her,  You re going to find me  Roger s Angels.  You re going to find me whores.

15819,STEVE JOBS’ WIDOW ANNOUNCES SUPPORT FOR “Revolutionary” HILLARY On Same Day Hillary’s Busted For Faking This…,"You d think she d know a thing or two about email servers and at a minimum, question Hillary s integrity Apple founder Steve Jobs  widow Laurene has told of her admiration for Democratic White House front-runner Hillary Clinton.Ms Jobs, 51, called former First Lady Hillary a  revolutionary  woman, and added that it s not just because she s a woman   but  the type of woman she is .Speaking to Time 100, Ms Jobs said:  Hillary Clinton is not familiar. She is revolutionary. Not radical, but revolutionary: The distinction is crucial. She is one of America s greatest modern creations. Her decades in our public life must not blind us to the fact that she represents new realities and possibilities. Indeed, those same decades have conferred upon her what newness usually lacks: judgment, and even wisdom. Oops wrong picture! It matters, of course, that Hillary is a woman. But what matters more is what kind of woman she is. Mrs Clinton announced her intention to seek the Democratic nomination on Sunday   and set upon the campaign trail with a trip to meet  ordinary  voters in Iowa.But she was blasted for her  staged  visit on Tuesday morning to a coffee shop in LeClaire, Iowa.Austin Bird, one of the men pictured sitting at the table with Mrs Clinton, claimed the whole event was orchestrated  from beginning to end .Bird told Daily Mail Online that campaign staffer Troy Price called and asked him and two other young people to meet him Tuesday morning at a restaurant in Davenport, a nearby city. Price then drove them to the coffee house to meet Clinton after vetting them for about a half-hour.The three got the lion s share of Mrs. Clinton s time and participated in what breathless news reports described as a  roundtable  the first of many in her brief Iowa campaign swing. Bird himself is a frequent participant in Iowa Democratic Party events. He interned with President Obama s 2012 presidential re-election campaign, and was tapped to chauffeur Vice President Joe Biden in October 2014 when he visited Davenport. What happened is, we were just asked to be there by Troy,  Bird said Wednesday in a phone interview. We were asked to come to a meeting with Troy, the three of us, at the Village Inn. The other two, he confirmed, were University of Iowa College Democrats president Carter Bell and Planned Parenthood of the Heartland employee Sara Sedlacek. It was supposed to be a strategy meeting,  Bird recalled,  to get our thoughts about issues. But then all of a sudden he says,  Hey, we have Secretary Clinton coming in, would you like to go meet her? And then we got in a car   Troy s car   and we went up to the coffee house, and we sat at a table and then Hillary just came up and talked with us. Bird said  we all were called. I mean, Troy asked us all to do   to go to a meeting with him. And we didn t really know what it was about. I mean, he did. He knew. Via: UK Daily Mail",politics,"Apr 16, 2015"
11119,"MELANIA Thanks Troops For Sacrifices At Easter Egg Roll…FLASHBACK To 2016: “Peanut Crew” Had To Remind Michelle Obama To Mention Troops, After Using Easter Speech To Brag About All Of Their Accomplishments [VIDEO]","During the annual White House Easter Egg Hunt, President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump stood with their son Baron on the White House balcony and addressed the crowd. President Trump spoke briefly and then announced that as soon as they were finished with the activities, he and Melania, and their son Baron would be heading downstairs to sign cards they planned to send to our troops.  It was very touching to see Melania go out of her way to thank the military band and all of the staff and volunteers who worked  tirelessly  to make sure everyone had  memorable experience.  Melania then delivered a sincere and heartfelt message of gratitude to our troops,  I want to thank all of the military with us today, and all of the great military in this nation and service men and service women all around the world who is keeping us safe. Compare Melania s speech to this video of Michelle and Barack s final speech at the Easter Egg Roll in 2016:  Today is a little bit bittersweet for us, because this is the Obama administration s last Easter Egg Roll (pauses for reaction from crowd) yeah.   Michelle continued,  And if we think about what we ve accomplished over the past 7 years, it s pretty incredible. Because when Barack and I first got here, one of the goals that we had was to open up the White House to as many people from as many backgrounds as possible. To open it up to our kids to our musicians, to explore our culture, to expose families to healthy living and to just to have fun. Because what s more fun than being a kid and going to the White House for an Easter Egg roll and hearing the First Lady drone on about  healthy living? After several minutes of listening to Michelle drone on about all of her and Barack s achievements in  diversity  and bringing  their culture  to the White House, Barack had to interrupt her to remind her to mention the troops. He can be seen at least 2 times  saying,  military families  behind her before Michelle finally responded,  And also to our military families I ve got the peanut gallery back here remaining me of stuff.

7202," Minnesota Republican: Gay People Are Mentally Ill, Need Treatment For ‘Unhealthy Sexual Addiction’ (AUDIO)","He probably believes  pray the gay away  is the treatment, too.There is no law forcing straight people to seek such treatment, so this is clearly about stealthily trying to  cure  gay people when they do not need to be  cured  at all.But Minnesota GOP Rep. Glenn Gruenhagen thinks gay people have an  unhealthy sex addiction  that needs to be fixed.During an interview on WCCO Radio with Chad Hartman last week, Gruenhagen declared that gay people are mentally ill and should be forced to undergo treatment for their  unhealthy sexual addiction. Claiming that he has gay friends and friends who were former homosexuals, Gruenhagen fretted about the number of Americans who have an STD in this country, which the Centers for Disease Control says is about one-third of the population.Hartman then sought clarification. You are telling the millions of people in this country who are homosexual   and the rest of their lives are no different than me or yours   but that the reason they have described themselves as homosexual is because they have an unhealthy sexual addiction?  Hartman asked.After being given a chance to reverse himself, Gruenhagen didn t backtrack. Yeah,  he replied.  You can go on the Internet and there s treatment for sexual addictions right here in Minnesota, whether it s pornography or unhealthy sexual behavior. You can receive treatment for that and be free from those compulsions. Here s the audio via Raw Story.What Gruenhagen is likely talking about is dangerous conversion therapy which can cause lasting psychological damage and even be fatal. That s why it is opposed by the American Psychological Association.But Gruenhagen isn t just attacking gay people, he also thinks being transgender is a mental illness, too, and he has sponsored a bill in the Minnesota statehouse that would force them to use bathrooms corresponding to their  biological sex.  Such bills have been popular with Republicans as of late, with North Carolina being the latest red state to embarrass themselves with such a law on the books.Gruenhagen s proof that LGBT people have a mental illness comes from outdated versions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, which was updated in 1973 and 2012 to declare that being gay or trans is no longer considered a mental disorder.Republicans really need to stop being so obsessed with gay sex and it makes one wonder what Gruenhagen is hiding in his closet. After all, the lawmakers who fight homosexuality the most usually seem to be those who have homosexual attractions themselves. If that s the case, then Gruenhagen is the one who needs therapy, not to convert, but to stop living in denial.Featured image via Facebook",News,"March 30, 2016"

3728, About That Trump University Fine – There’s A Huge Catch; You And I Will Pay It,"After Trump s latest Twitter rant over the performance protest, or rather, polite urging of Mike Pence, the true big story of the day had some daylight, but not near enough. Trump, who claims he never settles lawsuits, did just that on Saturday when he agreed to pay $25 million in the Trump University fraud suits. While that might seem like a bit of justice served, it was revealed on Sunday that it will be the taxpayers who will pick up the bill.To be fair, it s not Trump s fault. It s the fault of the US tax code, which, as usual, favors the wealthy   you know, the people who can afford to pay $25 million in lawsuit settlements.Of course, the real cost to Mr. Trump is after tax, not before it. And most business settlements are fully tax deductible. The only part that arguably may not be here is the $1 million in penalties. But barring express non-deductibility commitments, many penalties can be deducted, too. In general, fines and penalties paid to the government are not deductible. Section 162(f) of the tax code prohibits deducting  any fine or similar penalty paid to a government for the violation of any law. Despite punitive sounding names, though, some fines and penalties are considered remedial and deductible. That allows some flexibility. Companies often deduct  compensatory penalties,  a maneuver affirmed in a recent Circuit Court ruling. Some defendants insist that their settlement agreement confirms that the payments are not penalties and are remedial. Conversely, some government entities insist on the reverse. Explicit provisions about taxes in settlement agreements are becoming more common.Source: ForbesYes, that is tax code, but there are exceptions which the Justice Department can enforce. For example, Credit Suisse was forbidden from writing off its fine of $2.6 billion for tax evasion.This all brings us back to the fact that we still don t have access to Donald Trump s tax returns. He doesn t pay taxes at all and in fact, one year, he reported a near billion dollar loss.Trump supporters paint him in a passive light. After all, it s not his fault the tax code is so easy for the wealthy to manipulate. The fact is, though, it s wealthy people like him who have been writing the tax laws for decades. That s why they are able to pay far less, as a percentage of income, than most Americans.If you expect this will get better with Trump in office, let s hope you re not holding your breath. Trump was caught just last week promising a restaurant full of wealthy people that he would be lowering their taxes. Of course, he didn t need to be caught on a hot mic. Analysts have already figured out that Trump s tax plan will benefit the wealthy, and only the wealthy, all while putting the country deeper and deeper into debt.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images.",News,"November 20, 2016"

3382, Trump Whines Like A Baby In Defense Of Russia Again And Gets OBLITERATED On Twitter,"Donald Trump sure is whining a lot in defense of Russia. In fact, he appears to have never heard the saying about protesting too much.Ever since the CIA concluded along with 17 other intelligence agencies that Russia meddled in our political process to help Trump win the election, the whiner-in-chief has been pouting like a petulant toddler.Trump first repeatedly denied that it was even Russia that attacked us, insisting that any country could have done it and that it could have even been someone living in their mom s basement.Then he claimed that nobody brought us Russian hacking prior to Election Day even though the media and public officials were definitely talking about it because it was one of the biggest stories on the campaign. Trump himself even encouraged the Russians to keep committing espionage against this country so that he could benefit from it.Now he s trying to deflect by tweeting about how Russia hacked the DNC and discovered that Hillary Clinton supposedly received debate questions in advance. Of course, Trump conveniently ignores the fact that he got questions in advance, too.Are we talking about the same cyberattack where it was revealed that head of the DNC illegally gave Hillary the questions to the debate?

15128,Just When Hillary Thought The News About Her Couldn’t Get Any Worse…This Bombshell From Secret Service Agents Happens [Video],"How this woman is even trending in the polls should tell you everything you need to know about the Democrat party Good morning, ma am,  a member of the uniformed Secret Service once greeted Hillary Clinton. F  off,  she replied.That exchange is one among many that active and retired Secret Service agents shared with Ronald Kessler, author of  First Family Detail,  a compelling look at the intrepid personnel who shield America s presidents and their families   and those whom they guard.Kessler writes flatteringly and critically about people in both parties. Regarding the Clintons, Kessler presents Chelsea as a model protectee who respected and appreciated her agents. He describes Bill as a difficult chief executive, but an easygoing ex-president. And Kessler exposes Hillary as an epically abusive Arctic monster. When in public, Hillary smiles and acts graciously,  Kessler explains.  As soon as the cameras are gone, her angry personality, nastiness, and imperiousness become evident.  He adds:  Hillary Clinton can make Richard Nixon look like Mahatma Gandhi. Kessler was an investigative reporter with the Wall Street Journal and Washington Post and has penned 19 other books. Among much more in  First Family Detail,  he reports:  Hillary was very rude to agents, and she didn t appear to like law enforcement or the military,  former Secret Service agent Lloyd Bulman recalls.  She wouldn t go over and meet military people or police officers, as most protectees do. She was just really rude to almost everybody. She d act like she didn t want you around, like you were beneath her. Hillary didn t like the military aides wearing their uniforms around the White House,  one former agent remembers.  She asked if they would wear business suits instead. The uniform s a sign of pride, and they re proud to wear their uniform. I know that the military was actually really offended by it. Former agent Jeff Crane says,  Hillary would cuss at Secret Service drivers for going over bumps. Another former member of her detail recollects,  Hillary never talked to us . . . Most all members of first families would talk to us and smile. She never did that. We spent years with her,  yet another Secret Service agent notes.  She never said thank you. Within the White House, Hillary had a  standing rule that no one spoke to her when she was going from one location to another,  says former FBI agent Coy Copeland.  In fact, anyone who would see her coming would just step into the first available office.  One former Secret Service agent states,  If Hillary was walking down a hall, you were supposed to hide behind drapes used as partitions. Hillary one day ran into a White House electrician who was changing a lightbulb in the upstairs family quarters. She screamed at him, because she had demanded that all repairs be performed while the Clintons were outside the Executive Mansion. She caught the guy on a ladder doing the lightbulb,  says Franette McCulloch, who served at that time as assistant White House pastry chef.  He was a basket case. White House usher Christopher B. Emery unwisely called back Barbara Bush after she phoned him for computer troubleshooting. Emery helped the former first lady twice. Consequently, Kessler reports, Hillary sacked him. The father of four stayed jobless for a year.While running for US Senate, Hillary stopped at an upstate New York 4-H Club. As one Secret Service agent says, Hillary saw farmers and cows and then erupted.  She turned to a staffer and said,  What the f - - - did we come here for? There s no money here. Secret Service  agents consider being assigned to her detail a form of punishment,  Kessler concludes.  In fact, agents say being on Hillary Clinton s detail is the worst duty assignment in the Secret Service. Watch Hillary show her true colors when a reporter in Africa accidentally refers to Barack Obama as  Mr. Clinton.  Hillary doesn t forgive her faux pas and does her best to embarrass the reporter:After studying the Secret Service and its relationships with dozens of presidents, vice-presidents and their families, Ronald Kessler s astonishment at Hillary Clinton s inhumanity should reverberate in every American s head.As he told me:  No one would hire such a person to work at a McDonald s, and yet she is being considered for president of the United States.

22854,Armed US immigration Officers to Be Stationed in UK Airports,"21st Century Wire says This latest move by the US is being sold to unwitting British holiday makers and business travelers as a  solution to long immigration queues at US airports. Under the new scheme, airlines would be forced to foot the bill for US security personnel and their families to live in the UK. They plan to pay for this by simply passing the extra costs onto passengers travelling from Britain to the US. In other words: air travel may have become more expensive for Brits heading to the US.It s not clear exactly why US officers have to be armed in UK airports. Not surprisingly, few UK media outlets bothered to even question that aspect of the story.Will the British government end up accepting this aggressive move by the US? If so, will it be a dangerous precedent?More from the Daily Mail Chris Pleasance Mail OnlineArmed US immigration officers could be stationed at airports in the UK under plans being discussed between the White House and Westminster.Under the plans British passengers would have their visa paperwork checked before boarding flights, allowing them to skip some queues after arriving in America.But there are fears it could drive up the price of tickets as it remains unclear who will foot the bill for immigration officers to live in this country.Both Manchester and Edinburgh Airport are said to be eager to join the scheme.Heathrow bosses are believed to have turned the idea down because the obstacles involved in bringing immigration officers to this country are insurmountable.Meanwhile Gatwick declared that it has  no plans  to participate in the scheme.Home Office officials confirmed that the plans were being discussed. While it would be up to each airport to negotiate a different process with US authorities, the scheme would need overall approval by the government.The US already has special immigration checks in six countries around the world, with more than 600 law enforcement officers are stationed at 15 locations.Pre-clearance operations in Dublin and Shannon in Ireland opened in 2008 Continue this story at the Daily MailREAD MMORE POLICE STATE NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Police State FilesSUPPORT OUR WORK BY SUBSCRIBING & BECOMING A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",Middle-east,"July 10, 2017"

12073,‘MIRACLE’ CONNECTION For Parents Of College Student Killed By Terrorists In France And Heroic Strangers,"Two days before the Berlin killings resurrected the darkest period in his life, Conrad Leslie says an unexpected message from a stranger on Facebook gave him and his wife a comfort unlike anything they had experienced since their son, a UC Berkeley student, died in the Nice, France, terror attack in July.The message, Leslie said, put to rest a recurring nightmare the couple had: a vision of their son s body on the promenade, alone for hours. In fact, a woman and her daughter had surrounded Nicholas Leslie s body with candles and prayed for him throughout the night, Leslie learned. Instead of running in fear, they asked the police if they could stay,  said Leslie of Del Mar (San Diego County).  It was a cold night, and they stayed with his body. It was like a Christmas story for us   a miracle almost. The Facebook message came from a French woman whose mother vacations in Nice every year. She said her mother ran into two women   also a mother and daughter   who told the story of finding a young man s body along the promenade and staying with him until first responders came.The woman who learned the story read an article in Le Monde that quoted Leslie as saying no one was with his son. But based on the description of the young man s body and the location of where he died as reported in the newspaper, she connected the dots and told her daughter, who speaks English, to track Leslie down at once.After they connected on Facebook, Leslie says he is now trying to track down the mother and daughter who stayed with his son s body. I just know they exist, and we re going to find them,  he said.Nicholas Leslie (pictured above), 20, was in France for a study-abroad program through UC Berkeley, where he studied business and environmental sciences. In the summer program, students were encouraged to develop their startup ideas. His was to create a way to measure lactic acid generation in athletes in real time.On the night of July 14, Nicholas Leslie and his friends were strolling down the Promenade des Anglais along the Mediterranean. The group had planned to watch the Bastille Day fireworks and get to bed early for a trip the next morning to Barcelona, Spain.Leslie said his son, with a long striding gait, was about 10 feet in front of his friends, who dived down to the beach when a man driving a cargo truck intentionally ran over dozens of people, killing 86. One friend swore he saw Nick run away. Later we found out it was probably PTSD,  Leslie said.  But that helped us get the strength to go to Nice to look for him. The uncertainty and pain were recalled in vivid detail Monday when a similar truck attack in a bustling Christmas market in central Berlin killed 12 people and injured dozens. A huge manhunt continued Thursday as German officials worked to track down the attacker. It just brings back the moment for us as parents. We felt the desperation, the pain,  Leslie said.  It s a new world we live in, and it s terrible. Leslie, an engineer and mostly lapsed Catholic, said the writings on death by the 18th century scientist Emanuel Swedenborg helped him cope. Although he s bothered when people tell him that his son s death was God s will or that Nicholas Leslie is in a  better place,  Leslie said he takes comfort in Swedenborg s idea that two angels carried his son to heaven, embodied by the mother and daughter who prayed over him.THE FAMILY OF NICHOLAS CREATED A SCHOLARSHIP IN HIS NAME: Nicolos Leslie Memorial Fundraiser Read more: sfchronicle",politics,"Dec 22, 2016"

It shows what life is like for teachers and students in Detroit.Detroit s mayor, Mike Duggan recently went on a tour of DPS schools. He was  heartbroken  over what he saw. I saw 4-year-olds in a classroom where it was about 50 degrees,  he said.  They told me they usually wear their coats until lunchtime, when they warm up a bit   because there s a part of each day they actually expect to have to wear their coats in the classroom. It s nice to hear that Duggan still has enough of a heart left to be broken. The tour was nothing more than a publicity stunt created to make it look like the state is trying to do something to fix the problem. Now that the nation is watching the state of Michigan and the Snyder administration s corruption and incompetence that has infected the entire state on every level, they really, really need to convince people that they care.Even with the Flint water crisis, the Detroit water crisis, the shame that is the DPS, Snyder cannot even bring himself to criticize emergency manager Earley. Here is what Snyder had to say about Earley and the teacher protesters last week: He s been doing a good job. He s been working hard. If you think about it, our goal is to get the Detroit Public Schools to be successful. I ve proposed a package that involves an investment of over $700 million to improve education in Detroit. I m not sure why people would want to go out and protest against a solution like that. The state of Michigan has been in control of Detroit Public School system for almost seven f##king years. The cries of anyone who have spoken out against the Snyder administration have been meet with silence. Snyder s $700 million dollar proposal should, at this point, be seen as nothing more than a last-minute attempt to try to bribe his way out of being lynched by a growing mob.Snyder and all his cronies must be brought to justice for their crimes against humanity.Featured Image Courtesy: Detroitteach via Twitter",News,"January 17, 2016"

Trump has a home in Palm Beach. In 2010, a local air traffic controller named the points DONLD, TRMMP and UFIRED.

8528, Maine’s Governor Refuses To Answer One Simple Question – Then Things Get Really Weird (VIDEO),"The Rachel Maddow Show attempted to reach out to Maine Governor Paul LePage s office to see if he would be delivering his annual State of the State speech this year (after threatening he wouldn t do it). Instead of getting a response to that simple question, the Governor s office decided to make things really weird. Not only did the Governor and his aides not answer the question, but they made complete fools of themselves in the process. It was a war of words, to say the least.Here is the question they thought was so horrible: Hi, wanted to see if the governor has made a decision about whether or not he will give the State of the State address in person to lawmakers or if he still plans to send a letter. Do you have any information on that decision yet? Thanks! The very first message Maddow got back was: Why does Rachel Maddow have such an unnatural obsession with Governor LePage? Her neurotic fixation on his is kind of bizarre. What happened after that is just a back and forth of sheer awkwardness.While it is true that Maddow has reported on Governor LePage, and probably not in the most favorable light, that is the job of a national reporter after all. And   he s made a lot of stupid statements. Of course, a liberal show is going to laugh at someone like LePage for those comments. She reports on the news. It would have been very easy for LePage s office to say  we re not sure yet,  leaving Maddow almost nowhere to go with the exchange, even if she was trying to troll him.Surely the Governor and his aides must have known that this is precisely the last thing they would want to do to someone who commands an audience of millions. Not very smart. Then again, Tea Party Republicans aren t the brightest, either.Featured image via screen capture",News,"January 26, 2016"

8910, NRA ‘Good Guy With a Gun’ Angry About Obama’s Executive Orders Shoots Up Apartment Building (VIDEO),"Gun enthusiasts across the country have been expressing their rage over President Obama s common sense attempts to close the  gun show loophole  and make America safer by keeping firearms out of the hands of people who should not have them   like those who would start shooting up a building because they are displeased with the idea of keeping children safe from violent criminals.Ever since Obama announced his planned executive action on guns, conservatives have been preparing for  war on the President s policies. We ve been hearing from the right that President Obama is making a gun grab   that he s coming to round-up law-abiding gun owners and something, something Dark Side. And, of course, as we saw with Robert Dear and the extreme anti-Planned Parenthood rhetoric, one brave ammosexual decided to do what he viewed as his duty and offer up an armed opposition to Obama s policies.At around 6 p.m. on Tuesday, police in Redding, California responded to a report of shots fired at an apartment building. According to a statement from the Shasta County Sheriff s Department, what law enforcement found was sort of expected. A white man in his 50s had fired 6-8 shots into neighboring apartments because he was mad at Obama for attempting to reform gun laws. If that s not bad enough, he also had a letter from the NRA taped to his window. Once police arrived, he began shooting at them: Officers made verbal contact with the subject, described as a white adult male in his 50 s via a patrol car PA system. The suspect would open the door to the apartment briefly and yell at the officers.  Witnesses on scene later advised detectives that the suspect was upset about the recent legislation regarding gun laws issued by President Obama. The suspect was not compliant with officers who directed the suspect to exit his apartment with his hands up. During this time, officers attempted to subdue the suspect by utilizing less lethal bean bag rounds which had no effect on the suspect s compliance.  An attempt to utilize a police K-9 to subdue the suspect was also unsuccessful. After further commands by officers for the suspect to surrender, the suspect exited the apartment holding a handgun in his right hand, leveling it at officers who were tactically positioned outside his apartment, in the parking lot near parked vehicles and nearby trees,  the release notes.  Nine officers engaged the suspect with handguns and rifles subsequently striking the suspect multiple times.  The suspect was declared deceased on scene. We heard the five shots   everyone was screaming,  resident David Rice recalled.  He came out screaming  Obama! Obama! Obama!  (Police) told him to come out with (his) hands up, and he kept telling them  No, no, no. One woman recounted being briefly taken hostage by the anti-Obama shooter, who grabbed her and pulled her into his apartment: As soon as he shut the door, he hugged me and he kissed me on the forehead. He was aiming at a guy, and then he just got sloppy   he was shooting everywhere. The shooter, whose name has not been released, had a documented history of mental issues and was a felon, but was somehow able to get a gun   in other words, he was exactly the sort of person the President s plan aims to keep from being weapons.Fortunately, no one was hurt (aside from the shooter) this time.Watch a video of the shooter below:(function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.3"";  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));EXCLUSIVE: Cell phone video captures exactly what happened at a deadly officer involved shooting Tuesday night in Posted by Madison Wade on Wednesday, January 6, 2016You can also view a report on the shooting here:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0-aOi2nkHk?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0&w=560&h=315]Featured image via screengrab",News,"January 7, 2016"

Natl Intel Director Coats about compliance track record pic.twitter.com/sT68H1yqHA  Fox News (@FoxNews) June 7, 2017It s not like Mike Rogers is untrustworthy. The guy has an incredible resume on Wiki:Michael S. Rogers (born October 31, 1959) is a United States Navy admiral who serves as Director of the National Security Agency (NSA), Commander of the U.S. Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) and Chief of the Central Security Service (CSS) since April 3, 2014. Prior to that, Rogers served as the Commander of the Tenth Fleet and Commander of the U.S. Fleet Cyber Command.Rogers is a native of Chicago, Illinois. He graduated from New Trier High School in 1977. He is a graduate of Auburn University (1981) and the Naval War College.Rogers received his commission through the Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps (NROTC) program and has served in the United States Navy since graduating from Auburn University in 1981. He started his career as a Surface Warfare Officer working in naval gunfire support operations off Grenada, Beirut, and maritime surveillance operations off El Salvador. In 1986, he was selected for transfer from Unrestricted Line Officer to Restricted Line Officer and re-designation as a cryptology officer.During the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq, Rogers joined the military s Joint Staff, which works for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, where he specialized in computer network attacks. From 2007 onward he served as director of intelligence for the military s Pacific Command. In 2009, he became director of intelligence for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and was subsequently named commander of U.S. Fleet Cyber Command and commander of the U.S. 10th Fleet, with responsibility for all of the Navy s cyberwarfare efforts. As such, Rogers was the first restricted line officer to serve as a numbered fleet commander and the first Information Warfare Community (IWC) officer to achieve the rank of vice admiral.In January 2014, the Obama Administration announced Rogers  nomination as director of the National Security Agency and the commander of the US offensive cyberoperations unit in the Department of Defense. Rogers succeeded General Keith B. Alexander, who served as the NSA director for nine years, and became the first IWC officer to achieve the rank of admiral. Although the NSA directorship does not require Senate approval, Rogers had to be confirmed by the Senate to head United States Cyber Command,[11] for which the Senate unanimously confirmed him.In his first public remarks as NSA director, Rogers stated that he believed that NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden was  probably not  working for a foreign intelligence agency, despite frequent speculation and assertion by the NSA s allies to the contrary. Rogers added:  He clearly believes in what he s doing. I question that; I don t agree with it. I fundamentally disagree with what he did. I believe it was wrong; I believe it was illegal. The Washington Post reported on 19 November 2016 that Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter and Director of National Intelligence (DNI) James R. Clapper Jr. had recommended to President Obama that Rogers be terminated as director of the National Security Agency. Carter reportedly recommended he be terminated due to poor performance, whereas Clapper considered it wise that the position be held by a civilian. Both Clapper and Carter had put Rogers on notice for poor performance in internal security and for a poor leadership style. His termination was reportedly delayed due to stalled changes to the bureaucratic structure of the intelligence community. Later, Rogers reportedly met with then President-elect Donald Trump without notifying his supervisors in what is an unprecedented action for a military officer. Trump was reportedly considering replacing Clapper with Rogers as DNI, however that position went to former Senator Dan Coats, with Rogers remaining NSA director.",politics,"Jun 7, 2017"
17112,OBAMA USES LABOR DAY TO HARM PRIVATE SECTOR WITH NEW EXECUTIVE ORDER Giving Government An Unfair Advantage With Workers,"Barack Obama, champion of the taxpayer funded government employee. Destroyer of the private sector President Barack Obama on Monday ordered government contractors to offer their workers seven days of paid sick leave a year and, without naming them, knocked Republican presidential candidates for advocating what he said were anti-union policies.Obama signed an executive order on sick leave, which the White House said would affect some 300,000 people, during a flight to Boston, where he spoke at a union event.Starting in 2017, workers on government contracts will earn a minimum of one hour of paid sick leave for every 30 hours worked. Contractors can offer more generous amounts at their discretion.Speaking to a friendly crowd without a tie or jacket, Obama said such policies were beneficial to employers and said more worker friendly measures, such as paid maternity leave, were needed. Right now, we are the only advanced nation on Earth that does not guarantee paid maternity leave,  he said. Now, for the men in the audience in particular, think about that. We wouldn t even go to work if we had to carry around somebody for nine months. The human race would evaporate,  he said, drawing laughter and applause from the crowd.Unions and organized labor are a key constituent for the Democratic Party, and their support will be critical in the 2016 presidential election.Obama, who joked that he was glad not to be on the ballot next year, made thinly veiled references to Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie for anti-union remarks and policies. He did not name them by name. It s clear he stands with the big government union bosses while we stand with the people,  Walker, during a campaign stop in New Hampshire, said in response to the president.The executive order follows a series of measures by the White House to expand access to paid leave. In January, Obama issued a presidential memorandum directing the government to advance up to six weeks of paid sick leave for the birth or adoption of a child, or for other sick leave-eligible uses.Obama is also pressing Congress to pass legislation giving government employees six additional weeks of paid parental leave. Labor Secretary Thomas Perez said he could not say what the cost of implementing the seven-day paid leave rule would be to contractors. We believe the cost of implementing this rule is offset by the efficiencies that come with reduced attrition, increased loyalty, all of those things that have been documented in a number of studies of state laws that have been enacted,  Perez told reporters on a conference call on Sunday.Obama also used the trip to Boston to renew his call for Congress to pass the Healthy Families Act, which would require all businesses with 15 or more employees to offer up to seven paid sick days each year.According to the White House, an estimated 44 million private-sector workers, about 40 percent of the total private-sector workforce, do not have access to paid sick leave.

4688, Watch This Mattress Company’s Impossibly Vile 9/11 Sale Commercial (VIDEO),"Miracle Mattress of San Antonio wants everyone to know that they ll never forget Sept. 11, 2001. To that end, they posted the most amazingly, disgustingly tone-deaf and just plain terrible commercial to commemorate the anniversary of the worst terrorist attack on U.S. soil. It was cheerful, it talked about the Twin Towers and used them to promote discounts on all their mattresses, and then And then they took it too far. Way too far. So impossibly far that we can t even see it from the boundaries of decency with the Hubble Space Telescope.Because using a national tragedy to promote a sale isn t classless enough.Watch it for yourself (TRIGGER WARNING):It was posted to a parody page aimed at shaming Miracle Mattress up one side and down the other for this, and remains viewable there. It has been removed from social media elsewhere.Miracle Mattress has been shredded to confetti for this, to the point where they ve posted a letter of apology on their main Facebook page, and changed their background image to show part of that letter.

Many of the comments below are from members of the military, people who were in NYC on that horrific day, and even some of the responders.They re rightfully angry and their comments are heart-wrenching.

6080, S.E. Cupp SLAMS Trump For His Attacks On The Media (VIDEO),"Throughout his entire presidential campaign, Donald Trump has whined about the media. He calls reporters  dishonest,  tells the thousands of low-information voters who flock to his rallies that the press hates him and therefore they should hate the press. He points to the press pit at these events and tells his supporters to yell at them and every single time he does an interview he complains that someone somewhere in the world of media, even right-wing media, is treating him  unfairly.  On Tuesday, CNN s S.E. Cupp slammed the presidential candidate for his treatment of the media and said that he is  fundamentally confused about the roll of free press. During a press conference about his  support  of veteran s groups on Tuesday, Trump threw another hissy fit about reporters and said that they are being  nasty  and not giving him credit for giving money to vets. Cupp responded to his whining, saying: When you re talking about suing journalists for doing their job, he s not saying that we re getting the story wrong, we re actually doing our job asking questions about where this money went that s the job of the press. He actually said in this press conference today, I wish you d just say thank you, thank me for,  that s not the role of the media, to thank the presidential nominee for raising money. It s not the job of the media to heap praise upon him. So I just think that he s fundamentally very confused about the role of free press.. .@secupp: Trump says he wished the press would just say thank you, that s not the role of the media! https://t.co/QUwwpKW7uS  The Situation Room (@CNNSitRoom) May 31, 2016I disagree, I think Trump is very aware of the role of the free press, but he doesn t want his supporters to be aware of it. It is no secret that the people who support the billionaire are not the brightest crayons in the box. Trump has even talked about how much he loves his  poorly educated voters.  He needs to convince these people to distrust the press because then they will just tune out the stories that would sink his candidacy. He needs them to ignore the shadiness around the money he supposedly raised for veterans. He needs them to ignore the Trump University story and how he swindled people out of their money. He needs them to ignore every single bad report that they may see on the news in the coming months.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 14, 2017That s right. Trump literally called Lewis  all talk  and  no action  and bashed the city of Atlanta despite the fact that the city is not the hellscape Trump claims it to be. In fact, the city hit back at Trump because Atlanta is a thriving city and the crown jewel of Georgia.It is also a fact that John Lewis tirelessly fought for civil rights and voting rights and marched with Martin Luther King. He even suffered brutal beatings by police for peacefully protesting.Trump, meanwhile, was born with a silver spoon in his mouth and inherited his fortune from his wealthy daddy. He never had to work a day in his life and he certainly never fought for anything or anyone but himself.Trump has drawn outrage across the nation over his attack, and Senator Elizabeth Warren fired back at Trump in defense of Lewis on Monday during the annual Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Breakfast in Boston.Warren slammed Trump for never putting his life at risk for anything and said Lewis has earned the right to criticize Trump and boycott the inauguration. The president-elect stepped over a line when he attacked John Lewis as a man who is all talk and no action,  Warren declared.  John Lewis is a man who literally put his life on the line to make this a better country, a fairer country, a country that is more open. Donald Trump hasn t put his life on the line for anyone except Donald Trump. John Lewis has earned the right to raise questions about legitimacy. Right now, our intelligence community tells us that Russia directly interfered in the election here in the United States. John Lewis has a question about that and if John Lewis wants not to attend because of that, that s certainly his right.

Lewis literally bled for this country while Trump dodged the draft during the Vietnam War because he cares nothing about this country. The only reason he ran for president was so he could enrich himself and his family. It s definitely not about helping the American people, or else he would not be cheering about millions of Americans being stripped of their health care. Lewis, on the other hand, has fought for bettering the lives of all Americans for decades and he deserves respect for that and an apology from Trump.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"January 16, 2017"
20489,LOL! The Woman Who Couldn’t Be Bothered With Protecting Lives Of Brave Americans Serving In Benghazi Attacks Trump On National Security,"Ironically, the two issues that catapulted Trump past all of his competitors in the GOP Presidential race were building the wall on our southern border and not allowing unveiled refugees to enter our country. We re gonna go out on a limb and guess that based on Trump s popularity with a wide variety of Americans, both issues are pretty important when it comes to our national security.Hillary Clinton will launch an attack on Donald Trump s national security policy Thursday, focusing on an issue the likely Democratic presidential nominee could use to her advantage over the billionaire New Yorker.The address in San Diego will  make clear the threat that Donald Trump would pose to our national security and to put forth her own vision for keeping America safe at home and leading in the world,  Clinton s campaign said in a statement Wednesday afternoon.For Clinton, the move is part of an effort to paint Trump as fundamentally unsuited to lead the world s most powerful military as she hopes to pivot away from the extended Democratic primary and toward a general election match-up with the presumptive GOP nominee.The attacks on Trump s lack of national security bona fides have increased speculation that he might pick a running mate with more experience in the defense or foreign policy, such as Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.). Throughout this campaign, Trump has refused to outline any coherent foreign policy doctrine, failed to demonstrate a basic understanding of world affairs, and repeatedly proven he s temperamentally unfit to serve as our commander in chief,  Clinton s campaign said on Wednesday.Despite his apparent weaknesses, however, Trump benefitted the most when the GOP primary contest took on a national security focus following deadly terror attacks in Paris and San Bernardino last year. Notwithstanding their radical nature, Trump s proposals to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and temporarily ban foreign Muslims from entering the country have attracted a fair amount of support from fellow Republicans.",left-news,"Jun 1, 2016"

He has continuously warned us about how dangerous this man is to our democracy. But on Thursday, he did something that was both unexpected and yet arguably necessary at this point: He pleaded with foreign intelligence agencies from around the world to help save the citizens of the U.S. from this  coup  by releasing any damning information they may have on the Trump administration.Olbermann begged these intel agencies, from all across the globe, to make the information they are rumored to have available to the American public. He urged them not to wait, to act now. Give the information to a reporter, leak it, put it on the internet, leave it outside someone s back door, he pleaded in desperation.Trump has fired the man investigating him, crippling our own intelligence agencies in the process, Olbermann continued. American citizens have lost their democracy as a result of this coup, and Republicans, the very people who have the power to stop him today, are choosing to do nothing. In a last ditch effort to save the U.S. from Trump, Olbermann has turned to the only people left that can help us: the intelligence agencies of other countries.Whether or not Olbermann s call to action will move someone to release damaging information remains to be seen.

5339, WATCH: Trump Stumbles When Asked If He Would Support Former KKK Grand Wizard (VIDEO),"Donald Trump sat down with for an interview with Chuck Todd Sunday morning during an episode of MSNBC s Meet the Press. During the interview, Todd questioned Trump on the matter of former KKK Grand Wizard David Duke. Duke has been a vocal supporter of Trump throughout the GOP primary. He is also now running for a U.S. Senate seat. Duke says that he was inspired to run for office because of Trump s campaign.Trump has previously denounced Duke s views and his endorsement of his campaign. Trump says in the interview that he does not support Duke s senatorial run. However, after a bit of grilling from Todd, Trump implies that he might vote for Duke under certain circumstances. Todd said: David Duke announced his Senate candidacy claiming your agenda for his own, or essentially saying glad that you spoke out. Newt Gingrich said, every Republican should repudiate this guy no matter what he says. Trump responds by saying  I did and I do. That s when Todd asks Trump: Would you support a Democrat over David Duke, if that was what was necessary to defeat him? Trump then says that it would depend on the Democrat who is running for office. Though he does say that he wouldn t support Duke. I guess, depending on who the Democrat was, but the answer would be yes. Look, the answer is, as quick as you can say it, rebuked. Is that OK? Rebuked. It shouldn t matter who is running against Duke, as long as they are better than Duke himself. It s nearly impossible to imagine a candidate that could be worse than Duke running on a Democratic ticket. Even if someone is a firm believer in not supporting the lesser of two evils relative to their political position, you do everything you can to support that candidate if their opponent happens to be a former leader of one of the worst hate groups in the United States.You can watch the interview below.Featured image via video screenshot",News,"July 24, 2016"
2096, WATCH: Republican Senator Admits That Trumpcare Bill Won’t Lower Health Insurance Premiums,"While the Affordable Care Act actually has slowed down the rising cost of premiums, the Republican healthcare bill that repeals it definitely won t.And Republican Senator Tom Cotton openly admitted it on Sunday during an interview on CNN.Ever since House Republicans unveiled their legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act it has been panned by Democrats and Republicans alike. Donald Trump thinks it s  wonderful,  but the American people are outraged because the bill would strip healthcare from tens of millions and would cause the cost of healthcare to skyrocket, especially among senior citizens and those with low incomes.The bottom line is that this is a terrible bill that will hurt millions of Americans who need affordable access to health insurance.Jake Tapper specifically asked Cotton whether he would keep the Medicaid expansion considering he represents Arkansas, one of the poorest states in the nation.Of course, Cotton seems to think that the only people who get Medicaid are people who are unemployed.Cotton said that he supports a Medicaid  transformation  bill in which  able-bodied  adults are not allowed to be covered by the program. He basically told them to get a job and pay for their own healthcare. The problem is that many of those able-bodied adults actually do have jobs. They just don t get paid enough to afford health insurance. And then Cotton admitted that the GOP bill will not bring the cost of premiums down, thus confirming a major problem with the bill The Medicaid expansion I think needs to be part of Medicaid transformation and that s what the House bill moved forward. It can be improved to some degree, but it s about a 70% or 80% solution, Jake. The bigger problem with this legislation is on the private insurance market. I simply think that it s not going to work to bring down premiums for working Arkansans or working Americans around the country. Here s the video via YouTube. Cotton s remarks on healthcare are at the 3 minute mark:The Affordable Care Act is not perfect but it s far superior to anything Republicans have offered. Trumpcare will hurt millions of Americans and do nothing to bring the cost of care down. And while the wealthy will get a tax cut from the GOP bill, low income Americans will only be saddled with a financial burden. They would once again live in fear that a major health crisis could leave them bankrupt and homeless. No one should have to live that way.Featured image via screenshot",News,"March 19, 2017"

7728, Veteran Newsman Ted Koppel Scorches O’Reilly: You Spent 20 Years Making The News Dumber (VIDEO),"Legendary ABC News reporter Ted Koppel has seen a lot of change in the way news is covered during his lifetime   and clearly not all of it is good.In a fiery interview with Fox News pundit Bill O Reilly, Koppel turned the tables and laid out a scathing indictment on the entire conservative network s way of doing business. It was beautiful to watch.O Reilly attempted to seek advice from Koppel on how best to approach an interview with Donald Trump. The Republican front runner is known for being brash, aggressive and evasive. O Reilly put it to his former colleague,  Not an easy interview. How would you do it? But Koppel wasn t having the fake sincerity. O Reilly, and his ilk at Fox, created this monster. You and I have talked about this general subject many times over the years. It s irrelevant how I would do it. You know who made it irrelevant? You did. You have changed the television landscape over the past 20 years   you took it from being objective and dull to subjective and entertaining. And in this current climate, it doesn t matter what the interviewer asks him; Mr. Trump is gonna say whatever he wants to say, as outrageous as it may be. Thanks to people like O Reilly, who routinely ignore facts to push a right-wing agenda, Trump can get away with saying anything he wants and the gullible Fox audience will eat it up. Facts no longer matter because they ve been told for years that the truth has a liberal bias anyway.When O Reilly ignored the critique, Koppel again went for the throat. He suggested Fox might try to counter Trump, and this might sound crazy to a guy like O Reilly,  by some reporting. It s an old-fashioned concept, but I think demonstrating who and what Mr. Trump is and what his policies really amount to is something you don t do in an interview. He doesn t answer the questions. Letting Trump control the interview doesn t work. MSNBC tried it with their townhall and it was a complete disaster. Trump is a showman, what he lacks in substance he makes up for in empty bravado. Instead, Koppel told O Reilly, try actually exposing the truth for once.It s refreshing to see someone so unequivocally call Bill O Reilly out right to his face. It helps that it comes from a long-time veteran of the news business. O Reilly had hoped to get some tips from the years of experience under Koppel s belt, but wound up getting way more than he bargained for.Watch the video below via Media Matters:Featured image via Fox News",News,"March 3, 2016"

2565, Trump-Loving KKK Leader’s Bloated Corpse Pulled From Missouri Riverbank,"The body of Ku Klux Klan Imperial Wizard Frank Ancona, who disappeared from his home under extremely suspicious circumstances, was located the bank of a Missouri river Saturday. According to Washington County Sheriff Zach Jacobsen, Ancona s vehicle, which could be identified by the Trump bumper sticker according to his son, was located on Friday, but there was no trace of Ancona. Deputies responded on Friday and located the vehicle and secured it,  Jacobsen told the Daily Journal.  We left deputies at the scene and secured it overnight due to the loss of light. On Saturday morning we conducted a search of the area by foot by member of the Potosi Fire Protection District and the sheriff s office. We didn t locate much of anything in the woods, but we did locate evidence of a burn pile near Mr. Ancona s vehicle. The body was found by a woman who was taking her family fishing on the bank of Big River. We processed the scene and the body was transported by the Washington County Coroner s office for an autopsy to determine a cause of death,  Jacobsen says.  The body was positively identified as Frank Ancona and his family was notified. The details of the investigation that have been made public are interesting to say the least.According to Malissa Ancona, Frank s wife, he was last seen Wednesday morning when he was leaving for work. She claims that his employer had sent him across the state to deliver an auto part, but his workplace says he was not asked to do that. According to police, Malissa had initially been unreachable, so they stopped by her home where the found her with her son, Frank s stepson. Officers say they found a safe that someone had smashed with a crowbar. The contents had been removed, but Leadwood Police Chief William Dickey says police do not believe it was a burglary.Malissa had also posted on Facebook she was looking for a roommate at around the time Frank had  left for work.  She claims that he said he was filing for divorce when he returned home and would need help paying the bills.Interestingly, all firearms had been removed from the home   Malissa says Frank took them with him   except one, the gun he keeps on him at almost all times. Right now no one has been charged in his death, but that may change tomorrow,  Jacobson says.While this is certainly a tough time for the Klan leader s family, the Internet is responding as though Black Santa left them a gigantic Black History Month present. In public posts on Ancona s son s timeline, seemingly all the people who have watched Ancona s beliefs hurt people over the years came together to celebrate the slight downtick in the number of fascists in the world:                               Ancona will always be remembered by the world as the man who threatened to gun protesters down in the streets after Michael Brown was murdered by Ferguson, Missouri police officer Darren Wilson.Featured image via screengrab",News,"February 12, 2017"
14904,Why Would Obama Regime Allow 23 Jihad Training Camps “Capable Of Mounting Terror Campaigns Within U.S.” To Remain Open?,"In normal times, Americans would demand these jihad compounds be shut down. But we re not living in  normal times.  Americans have been bullied into submission by the leftist shame police. We ve been told we re  racists  and  Islamophobes  for even suggesting Islamic terrorists have any ties to Islam. Our government tells us,  If you see something, say something.  But beware of the wrath of the Left if you  say something  against someone who happens to be part of the  protected victim class. If the fact that there are 23 jihad training camps within U.S. borders isn t frightening enough, the fact that president Barack Obama has done absolutely nothing about them should be.According to a document released by the Clarion Project, 23 confirmed terrorist Jihad compounds belonging to Jamaat ul-Fuqra, a Pakastan Muslim Brotherhood and Al Qaeda-related organization, were operating within our own borders.The group of Muslims of America (MOA) are documented to have a connection to terrorism with training inside the United States. There was a 2002 unsolved murder at one of these compounds in Texas. When the Clarion Project obtained the 2007 FBI document detailing the Texas Enclave of MOA, what they found was deeply disturbing.The organization says it has a network of 22  villages  around the U.S., with Islamberg as its main headquarters in New York. TheClarion Project obtained secret MOA footage showing female members receiving paramilitary training at Islamberg. It was featured on the Kelly File on FOX News Channel in October. A second MOA tape released by Clarion shows its spokesman declaring the U.S. to be a Muslim-majority country.A 2007 FBI record states that MOA members have been involved in at least 10 murders, one disappearance, three firebombings, one attempted firebombing, two explosive bombings and one attempted bombing.It states: The MOA is now an autonomous organization which possesses an infrastructure capable of planning and mounting terrorist campaigns overseas and within the U.S. The documented propensity for violence by this organization supports the belief the leadership of the MOA extols membership to pursue a policy of jihad or holy war against individuals or groups it considers enemies of Islam, which includes the U.S. Government. Members of the MOA are encouraged to travel to Pakistan to receive religious and military/terrorist training from Sheikh Gilani. The document also says that,  The MOA is now an autonomous organization which possesses an infrastructure capable of planning and mounting terrorist campaigns overseas and within the U.S.  ~Clarion ProjectJamaat ul-Fuqra is known to be an extremely militant group of international terrorists. The compounds allaegedly provide paramilitary training to new recruits for jihad against America.The document also claimed that Jamaat ul-Fuqra was an  autonomous organization which possesses an infrastructure capable of planning and mounting terrorist campaigns overseas and within the U.S. This document was obtained in 2007, but still nothing has been done about these compounds or their activities.If you re wondering why, the answer lies with our very own president and Department of Homeland Security, which refuse to classify Jamaat ul-Fuqra as a foreign terrorist organization   even though plenty of evidence proving they are terrorists reportedly exists.The fact that Obama has done nothing to stop these groups only reinforces the notion that he chooses to support Muslim interests over American interests, and that is disturbing in every way.What kind of president allows this kind of training to happen in his own backyard?This is as good a reason as any for Americans to exercise their Second Amendment rights. If our president is more worried about being politically correct than he is the safety of our country, then the people deserve the right to defend themselves.Via: Conservative Tribune ",politics,"Nov 21, 2015"

This was a hot topic, considering that Trump had just accused Comey of lying under oath last week, when Comey said Trump demanded that he drop the investigation on Michael Flynn, Trump s former National Security Adviser.When a reporter questioned Spicer about why Trump wouldn t give up the recordings if they could prove Comey had lied during his hearing, it was clear that Spicer wanted to hide behind the bushes again. Spicer stumbled over his words and said: I think the president made it clear on Friday that he would get back as soon as possible on this. Things got even more humiliating as the reporter pressed Spicer further, So what s he waiting for, what s the delay? It looked like Spicer had completely given up defending Trump or trying to come up with a more clever response. Instead, Spicer said: He s waiting for  he s not waiting for anything.

The man, whom police have identified as 78-year-old John McGraw, was all smiles. He beamed as he told the camera:  You bet I liked it. Knocking the hell out of that big mouth. When asked why he needed to punch the 26-year-old, McGraw let his crazy fly at full force: We don t know if he s ISIS. We don t know who he is, but we know he s not acting like an American, cussing me. If he wants it laid out, I laid it out. McGraw believes the African American protester was from ISIS. However, his delusional bloodlust didn t end there. He went on to say that the man  deserved it  and warned that  next time we see him, we might have to kill him.  He again reiterated the idea that the man was a terrorist.The victim, Rakeem Jones, was reportedly sore but fine after the incident. However, police at the event decided to arrest him instead of McGraw.McGraw s violence is just another example of a disturbing trend at Trump rallies. As protesters continue to bravely come out to interrupt the Republican front-runner where ever he goes, his fans have taken to physically assaulting them. Based on McGraw s statements, the violence is inspired in part by delusional conspiracies gleaned from Fox News and the GOP that pretends Islamic terrorists, black people, and liberals are working together to destroy America.

While speaking on the issue of how to deal with Trump, Trudeau was able to show class and grace, while still throwing major shade at the bombastic, bumbling American president. Trudeau s low-key handling of Trump could cost him with his progressive base at home, but given Trump s penchant for retaliation, going after Trump explicitly could be harmful to Canada s economy, given the fact that they export so many products to our country.While speaking on Trump, Trudeau said: Why poke a grizzly bear while it s having lunch? Trump has just got into office and he is formulating his economic plans. This is clearly a departure from the closeness Trudeau had with President Obama. Their adorable bromance and open and affectionate friendship is surely something that will not be duplicated with Trump. Those familiar with the situation on how Trudeau may handle Trump acknowledge that no one quite knows what to do with him at this point. One source said: He is totally unpredictable. Of course, this isn t the first time Trudeau has thrown passive aggressive public punches at Trump.

However, Canadian Pollster Nik Nanos says Trudeau is doing the right thing regarding Trump for now: He has to avoid making any kind of criticism.

Obama also expressed a warning about the unpredictability of this election cycle. If we are not running scared until the day after the election, we are going to be making a grave mistake,  he said.As expected, Obama also had praise for Clinton, who served as his secretary of state after losing to him in the 2008 Democratic primary, saying he s seen her in  really tough pressure situations.   I m a Democrat, so it s fair to say that whoever the Democratic nominee was, I would want to get behind them,  Obama said, according to the pool report.  But I don t display the kinds of enthusiasm and energy and commitment to Hillary candidacy just because of the fact we belong to the same political party. He continued:  Until you sit at that desk and you re making life and death decisions, and you re deploying young men and women to war, or you re having to avert a crisis that could affect millions or in some cases billions of lives, you don t know how you re going to respond. Obama said Clinton is  not always the flashiest  but she is  the person who s going to do the work. Read more: Mass Live",politics,"Aug 16, 2016"

8145, Columbine Shooter Dylan Klebold’s Mother Breaks Silence In Riveting New Interview (VIDEOS),"Columbine was the original school shooting. Sure, there had been others, but that was the one that got the world s attention. It was the horror that was to become all too common in America s high schools and colleges. On that fateful day   April 20, 1999   the nation was rocked when 17-year old Dylan Klebold and 18-year-old Eric Harris went to their own high school and opened fire. They wounded 24 victims and killed 13 more. The truly horrific part of all of this is the fact that it could have been much worse   because, even more than a school shooting, Columbine was a failed bombing. Klebold and Harris had brought several homemade propane bombs with them in their efforts to make sure their attack on their school reached maximum effect   but the bombs failed to detonate.In the past, the parents of these infamous school shooters have refused to talk to the press on television. However, that all changed when Sue Klebold, Dylan Klebold s mother, decided to break her silence and sit down for an intimate interview with Diane Sawyer   her first television appearance ever regarding her son s devastating crimes.Mrs. Klebold talked about the guilt she has lived with over what her son did, and about the many things that she missed that, in hindsight, may have prevented this travesty, saying: I had all those illusions that everything was OK because, and more than anything else, because my love for him was so strong. Klebold then acknowledges that she understands why some parents blame her, why they believe that she and her husband should have seen that something was not right with their son long before he took it upon himself to commit any such atrocity. Before Columbine happened I would have been one of those parents. If I had recognized that Dylan was experiencing some real mental distress, he would not have been there. He would ve gotten help. I don t ever, for a moment, mean to imply that I m not conscious of the fact that he was a killer, because I am. Klebold hopes to help parents who might be unknowingly missing the signs that they might be raising killers by speaking out, both in this interview, and the book she has written, entitled A Mother s Reckoning, which will come out next week. Klebold says what we all know: that hindsight is always 20/20. I wish I had known then what I know now: that it was possible for everything to seem fine with him when it was not, and that behaviors I mistook as normal for a moody teenager were actually subtle signs of psychological deterioration. Perhaps the most powerful lesson comes from an essay Sue Klebold wrote for O Magazine, which is that you try to protect your kids from outside dangers, and can often fail to recognize the internal ones. She says in the essay:  I taught him how to protect himself from a host of dangers: lightning, snake bites, head injuries, skin cancer, smoking, drinking, sexually transmitted diseases, drug addiction, reckless driving, even carbon monoxide poisoning. It never occurred to me that the gravest danger   to him and, as it turned out, to so many others   might come from within. Most of us do not see suicidal thinking as the health threat that it is. We are not trained to identify it in others, to help others appropriately, or to respond in a healthy way if we have these feelings ourselves. Hopefully, this brave mother accomplishes her goal of saving lives through telling her own story, and hopefully she can one day find some kind of peace with what her son did.You can watch Sue Klebold tell her story in the clips below, courtesy of ABC News: ABC Breaking News | Latest News Videos ABC Breaking News | Latest News Videos ABC Breaking News | Latest News Videos ABC Breaking News | Latest News VideosFeatured image from video screen capture via ABC News",News,"February 13, 2016"
10593,NO SHAME! MSNBC ANCHOR Attacks Critically Injured Steve Scalise Who Can’t Defend Himself [Video],"Joy Reid is known for her racist slant on the news. She s one bitter and angry woman we ve reported on numerous times for her over-the-top rhetoric. This latest rant is surprising even for Reid. She goes after critically injured congressman Steve Scalise with the aide of a NAACP board member. Steve Scalise cannot defend himself right now The left has no shame!Reid:  There s a whole country out there and a lot of people, at least in my Twitter timeline, and it s a delicate thing, because everybody is wishing the congressman well and hoping that he recovers, but Steve Scalise has a history that we ve all been forced to sort of ignore on race. He did come to leadership after some controversy over attending a white nationalist event, which he says he didn t know what it was. He also co-sponsored a bill to amend the Constitution to define marriage as between a man and a woman. He co-sponsored the House healthcare bill, which as you said would gut healthcare for millions of people including three million children and he cosponsored a bill to repeal the ban on semiautomatic weapons. Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise is still hospitalized in critical condition but liberal MSNBC host Joy Ann Reid didn t let that stop her from portraying Scalise as an extremist just three days after an angry left-winger shot Scalise and tried to assassinate dozens of Republican congressmen in Alexandria, Virginia on Wednesday.House Majority Whip Steve Scalise was in  imminent risk of death  when he was flown to a trauma center Wednesday after being shot during an ambush of a GOP congressional baseball team practicing on a Virginia field. He will be in the hospital for a considerable period of time, presumably weeks,  said Jack Sava, trauma director at MedStar Washington Hospital Center, who spoke Friday about the Louisiana Republican who remains in critical condition at the hospital in the District.Sava added that Scalise  was as critical as you can be when he came in  after a single rifle shot traversed his body from his left hip through internal organs to the other hip as witnesses said he was fielding ground balls.The shot fired at Scalise left perhaps hundreds of bullet fragments internally, many of which may never be removed because surgery might be more dangerous than leaving them in place, Sava said. That circumstance is not uncommon for that type of injury, known as a transpelvic gunshot wound, the trauma surgeon said.Sava said Scalise will require surgeries soon for abdominal and bone injuries, in addition to the two he has undergone to repair a bone in his leg broken by the bullet. The congressman sustained  substantial damage  to organs and blood vessels, Sava said, and remains in intensive care.How can these idiots keep arguing with a man who is critically injured in the hospital? It s horrible because he cannot defend himself! ",politics,"Jun 17, 2017"

10128,THROWING GAS ON RACIAL FIRE? VA Police Confirm….Governor Terry McAuliffe LIED About Weapons Being Hid Around Charlottesville By White Nationalists,"Will the mainstream media report about this?Contradicting statements by Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, the Virginia State Police say they did not find caches of weapons stashed around Charlottesville in advance of last Saturday s deadly white nationalist rally.In an interview Monday on the Pod Save the People podcast, hosted by Black Lives Matter activist DeRay Mckesson, McAuliffe claimed the white nationalists who streamed into Charlottesville that weekend hid weapons throughout the town. They had battering rams and we had picked up different weapons that they had stashed around the city,  McAuliffe told Mckesson.McAuliffe s comments were picked up by other news outlets and spread through social media. But Corinne Geller, a spokesperson for the Virginia State Police, says that no such stashes were found. The governor was referring to the briefing provided him in advance of Saturday s rally and the extra security measures being taken by local and state police,  Geller tells Reason.  As a safety precaution in advance of August 12, such searches were conducted in and around Emancipation and McIntire Parks. No weapons were located as a result of those searches. The Virginia State Police also disputed McAuliffe s claims that Virginia State Police were underequipped to deal with the heavily armed militia members at Saturday s rally. The governor was referencing the weapons and tactical gear the members of various groups attending the rally had on their persons,  Geller says.  I can assure you that the Virginia State Police personnel were equipped with more-than-adequate specialized tactical and protective gear for the purpose of fulfilling their duties to serve and protect those in attendance of the August 12 event in Charlottesville. McAuliffe claimed in an interview with The New York Times that law enforcement arrived to find a line of militia members who  had better equipment than our State Police had.  In longer comments that were later edited out of the Times  story, McAuliffe said that up to 80 percent of the rally attendees were carrying semi-automatic weapons.  You saw the militia walking down the street, you would have thought they were an army,  he said.  Reason ",politics,"Aug 17, 2017"

It also was an opportunity to display some nimble gymnastics, according to Japan s TV Tokyo. The television network flew a helicopter over the Kasumigaseki Country Club on Sunday to capture the highly anticipated informal game.HERE S WHAT HAPPENED:It broadcast a video showing a player identified as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe trying repeatedly to hit his ball out of a steep bunker.

But just as the 63-year-old prime minister stepped onto the grass, he slipped, making a backward flip down into the sand. He quickly stood up and picked up his cap.Trump apparently never noticed the flip as he walked away, his back to Abe. An attendant raking the sand also continued his work.Tabloid magazines raised questions over whether the two leaders really talked during the game.

19046,RACIST LIBERAL REPORTER Arrested In Connection With 8 Jewish Community Center Bomb Threats…Blames “Nasty/Racist White Girl” [VIDEO],"The media and the Democrat Party has been coming down pretty hard on President Trump for not doing enough to call out the rise of hateful anti-semitism, as though Trump has a direct line to the anti-semites. Well, as it turns out, the first person to be arrested for his involvement in a string of bomb threats that were made to Jewish Community Centers is an openly racist, leftist journalist. Let that sink in. When 31 year old disgraced journalist Juan Thompson was arrested in connection with making threats against eight Jewish Community Centers, he immediately took to Twitter (where his feed is filled with hateful, racist views) to blame a white former girlfriend for framing you so you d be  raped in jail what else? Juan Thompson, of Missouri, is accused of making the threats as part of an extensive cyber-stalking  campaign  against his ex-girlfriend to  harass and intimidate  her, the U.S. Attorney s Office for the Southern District of New York announced on March 3.Thompson was fired by The Intercept last February after he was accused of fabricating sources in a story about the Charleston church shooting.Here s what you need to know.1. During One Threat, Thompson Claimed There Were Bombs in a Middle School & There Was Going to be a  Jewish Newtown In the now-retracted article, Thompson had claimed that  Scott Roof  had speculated during a phone conversation that Dylann Roof may been driven to murder nine black churchgoers at a Charleston, South Carolina church because  he kind of went over the edge when a girl he liked starting dating a black guy two years back.  Thompson s report was picked up by dozens of other news outlets.Thompson was hired by The Intercept s founding editor-in-chief, John Cook, in November 2014. Reed replaced Cook, a former editor of Gawker.com and the current executive editor of Gawker Media, in December 2014. Prior to The Intercept, Thompson had reported in Chicago for DNAInfo and interned at the local NPR affiliate, WBEZ.*On Twitter, Thompson claimed that the threats were made by his ex-girlfriend, the FBI said in court documents.The FBI has been investigating more than 100 bomb threats made to Jewish Community Centers, schools and the Anti-Defamation League, along with other Jewish organizations, since early January. There have been at least five waves of attacks, with multiple threats coming on the same day.Police do not believe Thompson is the main suspect behind the majority of the threats, ABC News reports. Police sources told ABC News that Thompson appears to have taken advantage of national news coverage of the threats to continue his ongoing harassment against his ex-girlfriend in revenge for her breaking up with him.

13835,BREAKING! INVESTIGATION: Hillary Clinton Did NOT Comply With Records Rules," Was Hillary Clinton negligent or was she doing this on purpose? Either way, it s a really bad situation and gives more fodder for the Trump campaign. Keep at it!The State Department inspector general concluded that Hillary Clinton did not comply with the agency s policies on records, according to a report released to lawmakers on Wednesday that also revealed that Clinton and her top aides chose not to cooperate with the review.The agency on Wednesday released the long-awaited report to Capitol Hill, copy of which was obtained by POLITICO, providing just the latest turn in the headache-inducing saga that has dogged Clinton s campaign.While the report concludes that the agency suffers from  longstanding, systemic weaknesses  with records that  go well beyond the tenure of any one Secretary of State,  it specifically dings Clinton for her exclusive use of private email.The watchdog s findings could exact further damage to Clinton s campaign, and they provide fresh fodder for Trump, who has already said he will go after Clinton for the email scandal  bigly.  The Democratic frontrunner s bid for the White House has already been hindered by high unfavorability ratings, with people saying they don t trust her. The report represents the latest pushback   in this case by a nonpartisan government entity   against her campaign s claim that she did not break any rules and that her use of a private server was completely allowed. The report also details how some technology staff said they were instructed to not talk of Clinton s email set-up after they raised concerns about the unusual arrangement.

Speaking at a campaign rally in Iowa, she blasted him for suggesting that the  Second Amendment people  were the only ones that could stop her from becoming president and appointing justices to the Supreme Court.Clinton said in no uncertain terms that Trump had  crossed the line  when it comes to his  casual inciting of violence. Words matter, my friends, and if you are running to be president or if you are president of the United States, words can have tremendous consequences. Yesterday, we witnessed the latest in a long line of casual comments from Donald Trump that crossed the line. His casual cruelty to a Gold Star family, his casual suggestion that more countries should have nuclear weapons, and now his casual inciting of violence.

Though the second amendment folks, maybe there is   He has since argued unconvincingly that he didn t mean it the way it sounded. Honest. He wasn t alluding to the assassination of his rival.

Can you take a guess as to who that one person might be? It s none other than your favorite democratic socialist, Senator Bernie Sanders.You heard that right: No one else, not Donald Trump, not even Hillary Clinton, pay their interns, not in a house, not in a tree, not anywhere (to borrow a line from Dr. Suess).The Washington Post ran an unofficial investigation from the angle of how  Presidential candidates ignore the costs of unpaid internships  despite their rhetoric to the contrary. It s particularly fitting considering they talk a big game about the  eroding middle class and rising social inequality,  yet they treat their own workers like slaves.Even the leading Republican candidates talk about income inequality openly, even though they may not get as much press coverage on the topic, yet still, somehow Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, Ben Carson, Ted Cruz, and Donald Trump don t care enough to pay their interns. Not Bernie Sanders, though. He pays his interns $10.10 an hour. Not too shabby!While we will admit this is nowhere close to the $15.00 an hour Bernie advocates for on the campaign trail, it s far and above anything else the other candidates are offering.If you believe in a higher minimum wage, this should be important to you.

The nutritive conditions of the North Korean soldier who recently defected through the Panmunjom were unveiled,  an official told Yonhap News Agency.Consistent updates have been broadcast through South Korean military s loudspeakers since the soldier, identified by his surname, Oh, was shot at least five times while dashing across the Joint Security Area   a strip of land at the DMZ where North and South Korean forces stand face-to-face   on Nov. 13. The broadcast operation is part of an ongoing psychological warfare between the North and the South.

Campbell asked:  What do you make of this whole thing?   Schlussel responded,  Well, only by Sean Hannity, not by Bill O Reilly.  Campbell stopped her Whoa Wait, wait, wait! Say that again. Schussed responded: Only by Sean Hannity, not Bill O Reilly.  Although listeners get the sense the whole interview was a set-up, Campbell appears shocked by this new sexual harassment allegation being made against Sean Hannity and asks again,  Sean Hannity what?  He hit on you, or he made you feel uncomfortable? to which Schlussel responded,  Yeah. She then went on to explain her so-called experience with Hannity.After she finished her story where she claims Hannity asked her to come back to his hotel, and that she received horrible treatment from him and his executive producer after she declined his offer, She went on to claim that he never booked her on his show again and that she got a  very weird feeling about it . This kind of stuff very uh all over the place at Fox News and with anything that has to do with Sean Hannity. She then went on to make an infer that Hannity s executive producer Jill Vitale quit the show because Sean Hannity wanted something from her and she wouldn t give it.  Schlussel claimed that everyone should start looking into it because,  it s not an above-board story. Here is Jill Vitale s response to the LIE Schlussel told radio host Pat Campbell, when she inferred the reason Vitale left Hannity s radio show had to do with Hannity s inappropriate sexual behavior:I left because I had kids! https://t.co/Ek81EVGkrH  Jill Vitale (@Flirtyflipper) April 23, 2017Sean Hannity used to tease Vitale about being a liberal on his show, which makes her tweet defending Bill O Reilly very interesting:Bill O'Reilly's out. Who's next?  Jill Vitale (@Flirtyflipper) April 19, 2017Vitale also advocates for O Reilly here where she tweets that NYC s top radio talk show should hire O Reilly. She doesn t exactly sound like a woman who left Sean Hannity s show because she was victim of sexual harassment:It'd be a smart decision for @77WABCradio to hire him! https://t.co/kOiG93QC7K  Jill Vitale (@Flirtyflipper) April 20, 2017Schussed continued to make more accusations during her interview:  And it s funny because I have a friend that s a radio host in a different city and, um that used to work for Rush Limbaugh. And whenever Sean Hannity would take about Jon Edwards and his love child, he would always call me and we would laugh about it because he could ve had a love child too, given that with some of the stuff we ve heard about him and some of the stuff I know about him. Schlussel went on to make another wild claim about Hannity, calling him a  pimp  for Roger Ailes and a  Fixer  for Bill O Reilly. Debbie Schlussel, a former Fox News guest, appeared on a local radio show on Friday and recounted an incident where Sean Hannity purportedly asked her to a hotel, and when she rebuffed his advances, she claims, she was ostracized by the network star. The story has since gone viral garnering headlines like  Sean Hannity Accused of Sexually Harassing Fox News Guest in publications like The Daily Beast and The Huffington Post. Now, in an interview with LawNewz.com on Monday morning, Schlussel is denying that she was ever sexually harassed by Sean Hannity. While Schlussel stands by her description of the incident, Schlussel told us that she doesn t believe what happened between the two amounted to sexual harassment by any legal definition. I would never accuse him of that. Sexual harassment has a special meaning under the law, and I would never accuse him of that,  Schlussel, an attorney herself, said.  Schlussel said the interaction happened in the early 2000 s when Hannity was in Detroit taping a show. He tried to get me to go back to the hotel after the show after he and his executive producer Bill Shine treated me horribly,  she said on the radio program. Schlussel later clarified that it wasn t his hotel room, but rather his hotel. She told LawNewz.com that she did go on the show following the incident, but after that was  banned from Fox News. I never thought I was sexually harassed by Sean Hannity, I thought he was weird and creepy not someone I liked,  Schlussel said.Following the radio interview on Friday, Hannity issued a strongly worded statement denying Schlussel s claims saying he plans to take legal action against Schlussel for possible libel. LET ME BE CLEAR THE COMMENTS ABOUT ME ON A RADIO SHOW THIS WEEK by this individual ARE 100% false and a complete fabrication,  Hannity said in a statement obtained by LawNewz.com.  This individual is a serial harasser who has been lying about me for well over a decade. The individual has a history of making provably false statements against me in an effort to slander, smear and besmirch my reputation. The individual has not just slandered me over the years but many people who this individual disagrees with. Schlussel responded to Hannity s legal threats, telling LawNewz.com she believed they were  laughable,  and that she is also contemplating countersuing him based on his statements on Sunday in which he called her a  serial harasser. It s defamatory,  Schussel said,  Everything I said was true, and truth is an absolute bar to defamation. He on the other hand has a murky record on truth. The accuser has a history of making allegations against Hannity. Back in 2010, Schlussel, who Gawker claimed at the time was a  crazy birther blogger, wrote a blog post claiming that the  Freedom Alliance,  a war veteran charity, which is supported by Hannity, was skimming donations, and was all a  huge scam. According to a 2010 letter obtained by LawNewz.com, Thomas Kilgannon, the charity s founder and president, fired back in a note to donors: the blog posting accuses our friend Sean Hannity of personally benefiting from Freedom Alliance. This is FALSE. Freedom Alliance has never provided planes, hotels, cars, limos, or anything else to Sean. Sean gets nothing from Freedom Alliance except our gratitude for his personal generosity and for all he has done to help the troops and our organization.  Hannity has reportedly donated more than a million dollars to the charity over the last several years.  LawzNewz",left-news,"Apr 24, 2017"

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017Drawing on sources including the New York Times and the Washington Post, Levin described the case against Obama so far, based on what is already publicly known. The expanded version of the case can be found here.Here is an important portion of that case: October: FISA request. The Obama administration submits a new, narrow request to the FISA court, now focused on a computer server in Trump Tower suspected of links to Russian banks. No evidence is found   but the wiretaps continue, ostensibly for national security reasons, Andrew McCarthy at National Review later notes. The Obama administration is now monitoring an opposing presidential campaign using the high-tech surveillance powers of the federal intelligence services.January 2017: Buzzfeed/CNN dossier. Buzzfeed releases, and CNN reports, a supposed intelligence  dossier  compiled by a foreign former spy. It purports to show continuous contact between Russia and the Trump campaign, and says that the Russians have compromising information about Trump. None of the allegations can be verified and some are proven false. Several media outlets claim that they had been aware of the dossier for months and that it had been circulating in Washington.January: Obama expands NSA sharing. As Michael Walsh later notes, and as the New York Times reports, the outgoing Obama administration  expanded the power of the National Security Agency to share globally intercepted personal communications with the government s 16 other intelligence agencies before applying privacy protections.  The new powers, and reduced protections, could make it easier for intelligence on private citizens to be circulated improperly or leaked.January: Times report. The New York Times reports, on the eve of Inauguration Day, that several agencies   the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the National Security Agency (NSA) and the Treasury Department are monitoring several associates of the Trump campaign suspected of Russian ties. Other news outlets also report the exisentence of  a multiagency working group to coordinate investigations across the government,  though it is unclear how they found out, since the investigations would have been secret and involved classified information.February: Mike Flynn scandal. Reports emerge that the FBI intercepted a conversation in 2016 between future National Security Adviser Michael Flynn   then a private citizen   and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. The intercept supposedly was part of routine spying on the ambassador, not monitoring of the Trump campaign. The FBI transcripts reportedly show the two discussing Obama s newly-imposed sanctions on Russia, though Flynn earlier denied discussing them. Sally Yates, whom Trump would later fire as acting Attorney General for insubordination, is involved in the investigation. In the end, Flynn resigns over having misled Vice President Mike Pence (perhaps inadvertently) about the content of the conversation.February: Times claims extensive Russian contacts. The New York Times cites  four current and former American officials  in reporting that the Trump campaign had  repeated contacts with senior Russian intelligence officials. The Trump campaign denies the claims   and the Times admits that there is  no evidence  of coordination between the campaign and the Russians. The White House and some congressional Republicans begin to raise questions about illegal intelligence leaks.March: the Washington Post targets Jeff Sessions. The Washington Post reports that Attorney General Jeff Sessions had contact twice with the Russian ambassador during the campaign   once at a Heritage Foundation event and once at a meeting in Sessions s Senate office. The Post suggests that the two meetings contradict Sessions s testimony at his confirmation hearings that he had no contacts with the Russians, though in context (not presented by the Post) it was clear he meant in his capacity as a campaign surrogate, and that he was responding to claims in the  dossier  of ongoing contacts. The New York Times, in covering the story, adds that the Obama White House  rushed to preserve  intelligence related to alleged Russian links with the Trump campaign. By  preserve  it really means  disseminate : officials spread evidence throughout other government agencies  to leave a clear trail of intelligence for government investigators  and perhaps the media as well.In summary: the Obama administration sought, and eventually obtained, authorization to eavesdrop on the Trump campaign; continued monitoring the Trump team even when no evidence of wrongdoing was found; then relaxed the NSA rules to allow evidence to be shared widely within the government, virtually ensuring that the information, including the conversations of private citizens, would be leaked to the media.Levin called the effort a  silent coup  by the Obama administration and demanded that it be investigated.In addition, Levin castigated Republicans in Congress for focusing their attention on Trump and Attorney General Sessions rather than Obama.  Breitbart NewsPresident Trump also used Twitter to build his case against the Democrats and how they are attempting to unfairly trash the reputation of Jeff Sessions,  an honest man :Jeff Sessions is an honest man. He did not say anything wrong. He could have stated his response more accurately, but it was clearly not .  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 3, 2017 intentional.

11545,BUSTED! OHIO ATTORNEY GENERAL DISCOVERS ILLEGAL ALIEN VOTERS…Calls For Full Investigation [Video],"Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted announced an investigation has uncovered that hundreds of non-US citizens are registered to vote in the state, and dozens of them voted illegally.According to a release from Husted, 385 people who are not citizens of the United States are registered to vote in Ohio. Out of those, 82 voted in at least one election in the last year.19 of the 82 non-citizens voted in the central Ohio area. 14 of those were in Franklin County, 2 were in Delaware County and 1 each in Fairfield, Licking and Union Counties.The 303 registered voters identified as non-citizens who have not cast a ballot will be sent letters both informing them that non-citizens are not eligible to vote and requesting that they cancel their registration. A follow-up letter will be sent to any individuals that still remain on the rolls after 30 days. Any non-citizens identified that remain on the rolls after being contacted twice will then be referred to law enforcement, according to Husted.

17784,WOW! CONFIRMED BY ICE: 5-Time Deported ILLEGAL ALIEN Protected By Sanctuary County Is Suspected ARSONIST Behind Worst Fires CA History,"Remember when candidate Donald Trump was condemned by the left for telling Americans that we have criminals coming across our borders? Well, it turns out that he was not only correct, it appears as though the worst fire in California s history that caused the death of 42 so far and over $1 billion in damage to almost 3,000 homes was very likely started by an ILLEGAL ALIEN arsonist. From Donald Trump s campaign speech at a rally in Arizona: The U.S. has become a dumping ground for everybody else s problems. When Mexico sends its people, they re not sending their best. They re sending people that have lots of problems, and they re bringing those problems with us.  They re bringing drugs, they re bringing crime, they re rapists and some, I assume are good people. Watch:Well, now that ICE has confirmed that the arsonist arrested in connection with setting the fires that devastated California is a 5-time deported ILLEGAL ALIEN, who in the media is going to tell Trump they re  sorry  for criticizing him? Will it be one of the local government officials in Sonoma County who decided to make their county a  sanctuary county  to protect people like Jesus Fabian Gonzalez, who was arrested Sunday?Breitbart   U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Acting Director Tom Homan confirmed on Thursday that a man arrested in connection with setting a fire in Sonoma County Wine Country is an illegal alien from Mexico who has been twice returned to his  home country. Homan also confirmed that ICE has issued detainer requests for Jesus Fabian Gonzalez five times now in the past year alone, including the one issued on October 16 in relation to his most recent arrest on suspicion of arson. All of the arrests were made  by Sonoma County on various felony and misdemeanor charges,  according to Homan.Sonoma County is considered a sanctuary jurisdiction and does not fully cooperate with federal immigration officials. That includes not honoring ICE detainer requests.  ICE was never notified of Mr. Gonzalez  various releases,  Homan wrote in the statement regarding Gonzalez.There were several fires in the region, and it is not clear what role the fires Gonzales allegedly set played in the overall disaster.The LA Times reported on the incident from eyewitnesses after Gonzalez was seen leaving the scene of the fire: He was screaming really bad things at the police when he was arrested,  recalled David Moreno, 29, who witnessed the arrest.  He was yelling things like,  I m going to teach you a lesson you ll never forget. Three Sonoma County probation officers patrolling Maxwell Farms Regional Park just before 3 p.m. noticed a plume of smoke rising from an area near the Sonoma Creek, Sheriff s Department spokeswoman Misti Harris said.Gonzalez walked away from the fire as the officers approached, Harris said. Nobody else was in the area,  Harris said.Sonoma County Sheriff s Department deputies followed Gonzalez to a nearby McDonald s. Gonzalez had  previous contacts  with law enforcement, she said.Gonzalez told police he started the fire because he was cold, Harris said. Officers found a lighter in his pocket.*The recorded temperature at the time that the fires started was a balmy 78 degrees.Some homeless people who knew Gonzalez said that he had a habit of setting fire to brush along the creek bed.Tensions were already high in this smoke-filled region, about 25 miles east of Santa Rosa.Local mechanic Shawn Stephensen, 40, said,  A few days ago I was walking down the street with a gas can and someone driving by stopped to say,  I wouldn t be carrying a thing like that around at a time like this. At first I didn t get it,  Stephensen, who knew Gonzalez, said.  Then it dawned on me    Oh yeah, instant felony case. What will Governor Jerry Brown, who recently signed off on legislation that makes the entire state of California a  sanctuary state  have to say about this recent development?

3217, Conservatives Are Now Arguing We Shouldn’t Be Able To Vote For The President At All,"If it weren t for the Electoral College, we would soon be inaugurating President Hillary Clinton. If it weren t for the Inaugural College, we would likely never have had a President George W. Bush and all the disasters that followed. No wonder Republicans love the Electoral College. They haven t won the popular vote for the presidency since 1988. It s also no wonder they want to abolish the popular vote.In an OpEd in the conservative blog, the Reason, writer Eric Boehm argued that ONLY the electors should vote and no one else.It s difficult not to agree with some of the argument. Boehm suggests that the Founding Fathers didn t trust Americans to think for themselves, and there is some truth to that and they were right, to an extent. In their days, literacy was not for the common man and today, well, we fall for fake news.Yes, get rid of the popular vote. For all the money, time, and attention paid to the presidential race, the actual votes cast on Election Day are basically meaningless. In non-swing states, votes are literally meaningless. Even in states where a small number of votes could change the outcome of the election, your vote and mine are still so insignificant as to be practically worthless, as Reason editor in chief Katherine Mangu-Ward explained in detail in 2012.The only reason to hold popular votes for president, as the system functions now, is to select the  electors  from each state who will participate in the Electoral College.Here s a better way. Hold a national lottery to determine the 538 electors (drawing an appropriate number from the voter rolls of each state) and then let those people choose the president.Source: ReasonAccording to Boehm, this would ensure that people who actually care about the election would be the ones voting. It would also free the rest of us up to do whatever we want to be doing, or whatever we need to do to keeps our lives on track.While it might be appealing to take the masses out of the equation, Boehm s solution does absolutely nothing to solve the problems created by the Electoral College. A vote in Wyoming, for example, is worth four times what a vote in California is worth. In other words, the Electoral College isn t even representative, let alone democratic.The other huge problem with the Electoral College is that it s designed to keep white people and people in power in power. It s also designed to suppress the vote and it leaves women and minorities without a voice at all.Obviously, I can t know what Boehm s motives are, but it s clear that the motives of the Republican party are to keep minorities from voting, wherever they can. The demographics in this country are changing quickly. If it weren t for the Electoral College, it s doubtful we d ever have another Republican president, at least unless they dramatically change their platform. As for the lottery he proposes, well, who s to guarantee the lottery would choose engaged voters? We d still have uninformed voters, just a lot fewer of them.Featured image via Sarah Rice/Getty Images.",News,"December 31, 2016"

As you know too well, this is a booming business down here. No more. We are going to shut down and jail those who have been profiting off this lawlessness   people smuggling gang members across the border, helping convicted criminals re-enter this country and preying on those who don t know how dangerous the journey can be. Further, where an alien has unlawfully entered the country, which is a misdemeanor, that alien will now be charged with a felony if they unlawfully enter or attempt enter a second time and certain aggravating circumstances are present.

Let me start by thanking the brave men and women of Customs and Border Protection, who not only served as our gracious hosts today, but who put themselves in harm s way each day to secure our borders and protect us.Here, along our nation s southwest border, is ground zero in this fight. Here, under the Arizona sun, ranchers work the land to make an honest living, and law-abiding citizens seek to provide for their families.But it is also here, along this border, that transnational gangs like MS-13 and international cartels flood our country with drugs and leave death and violence in their wake. And it is here that criminal aliens and the coyotes and the document-forgers seek to overthrow our system of lawful immigration.Let s stop here for a minute. When we talk about MS-13 and the cartels, what do we mean? We mean criminal organizations that turn cities and suburbs into warzones, that rape and kill innocent citizens and who profit by smuggling poison and other human beings across our borders. Depravity and violence are their calling cards, including brutal machete attacks and beheadings.It is here, on this sliver of land, where we first take our stand against this filth.In this fight, I am here to tell you, the brave men and women of Customs and Border Protection: we hear you and we have your back. Under the President s leadership and through his Executive Orders, we will secure this border and bring the full weight of both the immigration courts and federal criminal enforcement to combat this attack on our national security and sovereignty.The President has made this a priority   and already we are seeing the results. From January to February of this year, illegal crossings dropped by 40 percent, which was unprecedented. Then, last month, we saw a 72 percent drop compared to the month before the President was inaugurated. That s the lowest monthly figure for at least 17 years.This is no accident. This is what happens when you have a President who understands the threat, who is not afraid to publically identify the threat and stand up to it, and who makes clear to law enforcement that the leadership of their country finally has their back. Together, we will drastically reduce the danger posed by criminal aliens, gang members and cartel henchmen.To that end, the President and I want to do our best to arm you, and the prosecutors who partner with you, with more tools in your fight against criminal aliens. So today, I am pleased to stand here with you and announce new guidance regarding our commitment to criminal immigration enforcement. As we speak, I am issuing a document to all federal prosecutors that mandates the prioritization of such enforcement.Starting today, federal prosecutors are now required to consider for prosecution all of the following offenses:The transportation or harboring of aliens. As you know too well, this is a booming business down here. No more. We are going to shut down and jail those who have been profiting off this lawlessness   people smuggling gang members across the border, helping convicted criminals re-enter this country and preying on those who don t know how dangerous the journey can be.Further, where an alien has unlawfully entered the country, which is a misdemeanor, that alien will now be charged with a felony if they unlawfully enter or attempt enter a second time and certain aggravating circumstances are present.Also, aliens that illegally re-enter the country after prior removal will be referred for felony prosecution   and a priority will be given to such offenses, especially where indicators of gang affiliation, a risk to public safety or criminal history are present.Fourth: where possible, prosecutors are directed to charge criminal aliens with document fraud and aggravated identity theft   the latter carrying a two-year mandatory minimum sentence.Finally, and perhaps most importantly: I have directed that all 94 U.S. Attorneys Offices make the prosecution of assault on a federal law enforcement officer   that s all of you   a top priority. If someone dares to assault one of our folks in the line of duty, they will do federal time for it.To ensure that these priorities are implemented, starting today, each U.S. Attorney s Office, whether on the border or interior, will designate an Assistant United States Attorney as the Border Security Coordinator for their District. It will be this experienced prosecutor s job to coordinate the criminal immigration enforcement response for their respective offices.For those that continue to seek improper and illegal entry into this country, be forewarned: This is a new era. This is the Trump era. The lawlessness, the abdication of the duty to enforce our immigration laws and the catch and release practices of old are over.In that vein, I am also pleased to announce a series of reforms regarding immigration judges to reduce the significant backlogs in our immigration courts.Pursuant to the President s executive order, we will now be detaining all adults who are apprehended at the border. To support this mission, we have already surged 25 immigration judges to detention centers along the border. I want to thank personally the judges who answered the call to help us with this new initiative.In addition, we will put 50 more immigration judges on the bench this year and 75 next year. We can no longer afford to wait 18 to 24 months to get these new judges on the bench. So today, I have implemented a new, streamlined hiring plan. It requires just as much vetting as before, but reduces the timeline, reflecting the dire need to reduce the backlogs in our immigration courts.With the President s Executive Orders on Border Security, Transnational Criminal Organizations and Public Safety as our guideposts, we will execute a strategy that once again secures the border; apprehends and prosecutes those criminal aliens that threaten our public safety; takes the fight to gangs like MS-13 and Los Zetas; and makes dismantlement and destruction of the cartels a top priority. We will deploy a multifaceted approach in these efforts: we are going to interdict your drugs on the way in, your money on the way out, and investigate and prosecute your trafficking networks to the fullest extent of the law.Why are we doing this? Because it is what the duly enacted laws of the United States require. I took an oath to protect this country from all enemies, foreign and domestic. How else can we look the parents and loved ones of Kate Steinle, Grant Ronnebeck and so many others in eye and say we are doing everything possible to prevent such tragedies from ever occurring again?Let me finish where I started, by thanking you   the brave men and women in uniform who are at the front lines of this fight. I know we ask a tremendous amount from all of you, but know this: we have your back, and will do all we can to empower you and support you in your work.God bless you and thank you.",politics,"Apr 16, 2017"
1540, Comey Learned He Was Fired When Background TVs Flashed The News While He Was Giving A Speech,"Trump is famous for his  You re fired  catchphrase, but when it comes to actually firing someone, he s shown nothing but cowardice. His inability to face the person he s about to get rid of led to an incredibly humiliating moment for James Comey.Standing in front of an audience of FBI employees, Comey was reportedly mid-speech when phones began lighting up and the televisions dialed into cable news in the background broke the news that Comey should have been the first to hear: Donald Trump just fired you.According to the New York Times, the moment was understandably sheer chaos in the room:Mr. Comey, who is three years into a 10-year term at the helm of the F.B.I., learned from news reports that he had been fired while addressing bureau employees in Los Angeles. While Mr. Comey spoke, television screens in the background began flashing the news that he had been fired. Shortly thereafter, a letter was delivered to the F.B.I. s headquarters in Washington.The sheer lack of professionalism was so inconceivable that Comey laughed when he saw it and told the crowd that it was a great prank they just pulled.In response, Mr. Comey laughed, saying he thought it was a fairly funny prank.Then his staff started scurrying around in the background and told Mr. Comey that he should step into a nearby office.Nobody at the FBI was reportedly told ahead of time that their boss was about to be terminated. People are freaking out   even those within the White House.Another administration official described that the decision which caught FBI officials and top lawmakers completely off-guard on Tuesday was  kept very close to the chest  within Trump s inner political circle up until the moment  [we] were ready to pull the trigger  on axing Comey.Adding insult to injury, Trump s abrupt firing of Comey leaves the now former FBI director stranded in Los Angeles.Legitimate question about how Comey will get home from LA.

1542, Fear Of Being Defeated By Elizabeth Warren In 2020 Has Trump FREAKING OUT,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has been the object of some serious concern in the White House due to her potential as a 2020 presidential challenger, despite the fact she has said she will not run.The White House is teaming up with the Republican National Committee (RNC) to dig up whatever they can on Warren   and whatever they can fabricate   so they can circulate condemning memos to reporters.Meanwhile, aides in the White House are keeping tabs on Warren s criticism of Trump and have used the media to aggressively hit back. Last month The Hill published the Senator s criticism of America s largest non-nuclear bomb being dropped in Afghanistan, the White House quickly scrambled with a rebuttal   an unusually high level of concern over one senator. As somebody who is probably, in the hearts and minds of liberal activists, a leader of the party, that voice carries some weight, and we have to respond,  said a White House official who wishes to remain anonymous.In an effort to put down the Senator, Trump brought back his favorite   and most offensive   Warren insults last month, referring to her as  Pocahontas  while delivering a speech to the National Rifle Associate. I have a feeling that in the next election, you re going to be swamped with candidates,  said Trump.  It may be Pocahontas, remember that. Many see Warren as a likely 2020 presidential candidate, and when Trump can t find legitimated faults with his adversaries, he cowardly resorts to racial insults as attempts to make them look bad. Warren has abstained from engaging in name calling, despite what the Trump administration has to say about her. Elizabeth Warren is the perfect foil for the Trump administration,  says former Trump aide Sam Nunberg.  I always thought she would be the new Rosie [O Donnell]. Our base hates her; we think she s a joke. She s somebody to galvanize us. It was very smart for the president to bring her up at the NRA. The White House claims they are focused on governing but believe they also need to brand the Massachusetts Senator as out of touch and unfit for the presidency, while she holds a 56 percent approval rating nationwide in a recent survey by Morning Consult.It seems the White House isn t very good at hiding the fact they are seriously afraid of Warren s momentum and her potential to reach the blue-collar voters who backed Trump. Luckily, Trump s racist name calling makes him look bad, not her.Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"May 9, 2017"

879, Idiot Donald Trump Jr. Just Released Russian Email Chain — He’s Toast (IMAGES),"Donald Trump Jr. may have been born with a silver spoon in his mouth, but he seems to be lacking the  superior genes  his father claims as a birthright. On Tuesday morning, while in the middle of being a focus of the scandal that will rock his father s administration, he tweeted the email chain that very literally implicates him in colluding with the Russians. Yes, it s that bad.The chain was from June 6, 2016, and it was about setting up the meeting between Trump Jr, Paul Manafort (Trump s campaign manager at the time) and Jared Kushner.Here s my statement and the full email chain pic.twitter.com/x050r5n5LQ  Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) July 11, 2017The smoking gun came in this one:Here is page 4 (which did not post due to space constraints). pic.twitter.com/z1Xi4nr2gq  Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) July 11, 2017Twitter users were stunned, especially over this part, which explicitly states that Trump Jr. attended the meeting with the intention of getting dirt on Clinton, which he said he would  love. The documents  would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father,  read the email, written by a trusted intermediary, who added,  This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government s support for Mr. Trump. If the future president s elder son was surprised or disturbed by the provenance of the promised material   or the notion that it was part of an ongoing effort by the Russian government to aid his father s campaign   he gave no indication.He replied within minutes:  If it s what you say I love it especially later in the summer. Source: NY TimesSo I think this is the part people will focus on as showing knowledge he was getting something of value from foreign source pic.twitter.com/b566VDVgkP  Rick Hasen (@rickhasen) July 11, 2017and this about the  thing of value  itself pic.twitter.com/Pm8kEMp24U  Rick Hasen (@rickhasen) July 11, 2017And as to proving  solicitation  or  coordination  under campaign laws, Trump Jr. says  If it s what you say I love it  pic.twitter.com/HVMLsYzDLB  Rick Hasen (@rickhasen) July 11, 2017You lied about the meeting  twice. Why are we supposed to believe you now?

They already had the emails.Trump Senior has been trying to distance himself from his son since the story broke on Monday, but as the New York Times notes, the meeting took place just three floors below his office. Even if Trump argues that Jr. and Kushner weren t officially part of his campaign, he can t make that claim about Manafort.This is serious stuff. Trump Jr. asked to see the information (solicitation), and such information would be considered to be a  thing of value.  It s both illegal to solicit and it s illegal for a campaign to accept a things of value from foreign entity, and it s hard to dispute that such  dirt  on an opponent wouldn t be a thing of value.A foreign national shall not, directly or indirectly, make a contribution or a donation of money or other thing of value, or expressly or impliedly promise to make a contribution or a donation, in connection with any Federal, State, or local election.This won t be the final shoe to drop, though. Rep. Adam Schiff (D-California) says that the Congressional intel committee has a lot more damaging information than the public knows. Thankfully, though, the Trump family keeps inching so much closer to hanging themselves.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,"July 11, 2017"
921," Trump Tries To Shake Polish First Lady’s Hand, She Refuses To Touch Him (VIDEO)","Poland is acting like they don t quite like fascists or something. While some have criticized Andrzej Duda for arranging a cheering crowd (complete with a Confederate flag) to make poor besieged snowflake Donald Trump feel safe enough from criticism that he was willing to visit,it was worth it. It was so worth it.Humiliating Trump is becoming something of a sport among world leaders, whether they are dominating the handshake game, trolling him on Twitter, or even just letting him speak.Shortly into his remarks on Thursday, Trump majorly undersold Hitler and Stalin s invasions of Poland, calling them  tough  and  trouble    remarks that baffled literally anyone who has opened a  history book and realizes how horrific these events were.To top things off, Trump managed to once again find himself humiliated by a woman   a huge blow for the kind of guy who thinks women aren t people.Today s example of how little the rest of the world respects Donald Trump is sponsored by Polish First Lady Agata Kornhauser-Duda, who apparently decided to follow Melania s numerous examples and refuse to touch his hands.Though Trump was able to shake her husband s hand, the First Lady didn t want his greasy, smallish p*ssy-grabbing hands anywhere near her. As Trump attempts to shake her hand, she walks straight past without even looking at him and warmly greets Melania first. The most beautiful part is Donald Trump s expression.Our  President  is a joke and we re still waiting for a punchline that will never come.

5986, Woman Arrested For DWI Has Jaw-Droppingly Stupid Reason For Saying Cops Targeted Her,"The cops should leave this woman, and all of her people, alone unless they ve done something really wrong, and swerving all over the road because she s driving while intoxicated doesn t count. Why? Because  driving while rich  is apparently a thing in Manhattan, on par with, say, driving while black in Liridona Selimaj s apparently warped mind.A former real estate broker, Selimaj is one of Manhattan s more affluent residents, and she claims that the cops just pick on her and other rich people. They pulled her over because she was driving a new Range Rover, according to the bizarre claim. Assistant District Attorney Christopher Mills read off her full statement at her arraignment: You re picking on me because I was driving an expensive car. You make no money, and you re poor   you re picking on rich people. I had one drink. I m not taking your test, so take me to jail. I ve been through this before. That s right, she thinks the NYPD specifically went after her and arrested her because they re jealous of her status and money. She does have a prior DWI from 2009, and another arrest that s sealed, so she has  been through this before,  and she probably thinks those were just due to jealousy, too. In all her righteous anger, she also allegedly said: How can you say I was swerving? I m not drunk. I wasn t doing anything you were saying I was doing. I was swerving because it was a new car. The police report says she had bloodshot, watery eyes, was unsteady on her feet, was slurring her speech, and had alcohol on her breath. She was, in a word, sloshed. Driving while rich.  The stupid, it burns! If anything, the police are more likely to leave wealthy people alone and target poor people, especially poor minorities. It s the same with the courts. What Selimaj just did was show herself to be the perfect example of how the affluent expect special treatment, even when they ve broken the law.It s also an insult to all the people particularly poor minorities who are wrongly targeted by the police. Don t tell her that, though. Remember, she s just a victim. All rich people are just victims of the law.Featured image by Spencer Platt/Getty Images",News,"June 6, 2016"
17989,"HATE-FILLED LEFTISTS Tell Former Fox News Host Eric Bolling, His 19-Yr Old Son’s Death Is “Karma”…What He “Deserved” In Response To His Request For Prayers","Eric Bolling tweeted out a heartfelt statement about the unexpected death of his only child, 19-year old Eric Chase Bolling only one day after he was fired from his position as a wildly popular host on FOX News. The Murdoch s appear to be cleansing the network of any passionate and outspoken Trump supporters.  The allegations of sexual misconduct surfaced after a  Huffington Post reporter Yahsar Ali interviewed women who said he sent them inappropriate texts that contained sexual content.Eric Bolling, like Fox News host Sean Hannity, decided to fight back, and not take what he calls  false allegations  sitting down. Sean Hannity was a target of washed up blogger and lawyer Debbie Schlussel until he hired a team of lawyers who threatened to sue her. Like magic, the false allegations went away.Eric Bolling tweeted about his decision to fight the allegations by suing the author of the story on August 9, 2017:I will continue to fight against these false smear attacks! THANK YOU FOR CONTINUED SUPPORT  Eric Bolling (@ericbolling) August 9, 2017Huffington Post writer Yashar Ali responded:Just received a summons.

The Murdoch brothers also fired Roger Ailes, the then-head of Fox News Channel, for sexual harassment. Roger Ailes died shortly after his firing, many believed the firing took a huge toll on his health. It appears as though the Murdoch brothers have no intention slowing down on the firing of their most popular conservative hosts, regardless of the consequences.On September 9, Eric Bolling and his wife Adrienne lost their only son, 19-yr. old Eric Chase Bolling. The details of his death are still unknown, but rumors have been circulating that he took his own life after watching his father being smeared in the hate-filled, anti-Trump mainstream media. It wasn t enough that Fox News fired Bolling, or that he is suffering the unimaginable loss of his only son, the hate-filled alt-left liberals wanted him to suffer even more, as they took to Twitter to let Bolling know he  deserved  it.Bolling tweeted about the death of his son on September 9, making it clear that the details of his death were still  unclear . Here are some of the vile and hate-filled comments that leftists posted under his request for prayers: Sad news about your son, BUT karma is a hot bitch when she visits.Think about what you've done and the affect it has on others. #repent  Anthony (@Amgiv) September 9, 2017KARMA IS A BITCH !!!

15796,OBAMA’S FUNDAMENTAL TRANSFORMATION: Census Record Shows In 8 Years You Won’t Recognize This Country,"Adios America Census: Record 51 million immigrants in 8 years, will account for 82% of U.S. growthWisconsin Gov. Scott Walker disrupted the debate this week when he said that legal immigration also needs to be reformed to make sure Americans don t suffer by losing jobs to new citizens.But even more, the CIS report said that the surge in mostly legal immigrants will have a huge impact on the nation and taxpayers. These numbers have important implications for workers, schools, infrastructure, congestion and the environment,  said Steven Camarota, the center s director of research.  They also may have implications for our ability to successfully assimilate and integrate immigrants. Yet there has been almost no national debate about bringing in so many people legally each year, which is the primary factor driving these numbers. Those numbers are likely to shake up Washington s political debate over the 12 million illegals in America, the expected 70,000 expected to pour over the border this year and the 4.4 million legal immigrants on a State Department waiting list who have relatives or jobs in the U.S.A key senator steering the immigration debate, Alabama Republican Jeff Sessions, has warned that higher numbers of immigrants will hurt the middle class. In a letter to the New York Times Saturday, he wrote,  It defies reason to argue that the record admission of new foreign workers has no negative effect on the wages of American workers, including the wages of past immigrants hoping to climb into the middle class. Why would many of the largest business groups in the United States spend millions lobbying for the admission of more foreign workers if such policies did not cut labor costs? On Friday, key business leaders including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and a group associated with former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg plan to pitch for more immigration. Their schedule is below.The numbers, as seen in the highlights below, will also raise concerns that Washington is giving the keys to the nation to new immigrants:  The immigrant population will grow four times faster than the native born population, reaching 15.8 percent, or 57 million, of the nation s population in 2030, 17.1 percent, or 65 million, in 2040, and 18.8 percent, or 78 million, in 2060.  Net immigration this year will be 1.24 million; green cards about 1.1 million.  Immigrants and their descendants  will account for the overwhelming share of population growth,  said the Center in projecting growth. They will account for 75.5 percent from 2010-2050 and 82 percent from 2010-2060.  Census Bureau projects that in 2023 the nation s immigrant population, legal and illegal, will reach 14.8 percent of the total U.S. population, the highest share ever recorded.Via: Washington Examiner",politics,"Apr 22, 2015"

21322,Disturbing Uncovered Emails From Huma Abedin Bring Hillary’s Mental Health Into Question: “Often confused”,"How quickly the Democrats have forgotten about that little  incident  that landed Hillary in the hospital, following the death of the 4 Americans that she likely caused in Benghazi After reviewing more than 35 pages of email from top Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin, Judicial Watch observes that Abedin advised a State Department staffer that it was  very important  to review phone calls with Clinton because she was  often confused. Judicial Watch notes that Abedin emailed State Department Clinton aide and companion Monica Hanley from her  Huma@clintonemail.com  to alert her about the need to go over phone calls with Clinton.Additionally, Abedin s emails reveal  repeated security breaches, with the Secretary s schedule and movements being sent and received through Abedin s non-governmental and unsecured Clinton server account,  states Judicial Watch.On January 26, 2013, Abedin had the following email exchange with Hanley:Abedin: Have you been going over her calls with her? So she knows singh is at 8? [India Prime Minister Manmohan Singh] Hanley: She was in bed for a nap by the time I heard that she had an 8am call. Will go over with her Abedin: Very imp to do that. She s often confused. The emails also provide specific details of Clinton s last day in office on January 31, 2013. Exact times and locations of all her appointments during the day are given. Huma Abedin s description of Hillary Clinton as  easily confused  tells you all you need to know why it took a federal lawsuit to get these government emails from Clinton s illegal email server,  said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton.  These emails also show that Hillary Clinton s and Huma Abedin s decision to use the Clinton email server to conduct government business was dangerous and risky.  Via: Breitbart NewsHere is Bill Clinton attempting to convince the interviewer that  Hillary works out every week (not every day) and that she is the picture of health:From Edward Klein s book  Unlikeable :Ed Klein, whose book  Unlikeable  hits shelves on Sept. 28, told the National Enquirer that the former secretary of state is battling a host of  mounting health issues  including  blinding headaches  that have  frequently plagued her. Bachmann, a former Minnesota Republican congresswoman, bowed out of the 2012 GOP primary race after reports surfaced that she was wrestling with debilitating migraine headaches   including one that kept her offstage during part of a televised debate. A Clinton friend told Klein that the Democrats  current leading light might even be suffering from multiple sclerosis.Clinton herself released a letter on July 28 from a doctor who gave her a clean bill of health.Dr. Lisa Bardack of Mount Kisco, N.Y. wrote that Clinton, 67, has completely recovered from a December 2012 concussion that left her seeing double for two months.While treating that condition, doctors diagnosed a blood clot in her sinuses, requiring long-term daily doses of the blood-thinning medication Coumadin.Bardack added that Clinton had been diagnosed with blood clots previously, in both 1998 and 2009. But Klein s book goes far beyond talk of ordinary medical conditions. For the first time I ve known her, she s showing self-doubt about her strength and vitality,  a friend of Hillary told him, according to Radar Online.She also reportedly suffers from severe insomnia, which has  sapped her energy just when she needed it most for the campaign. She is exhausted and depressed a lot of the time,  the friend said, and has turned to sleeping pills in order to rest at night. ",left-news,"Nov 17, 2015"

12833,OBAMA’S FEDERAL AGENTS CAUGHT Spying On Law-Abiding Gun Show Customers,"Big brother is alive and well 3 months only 3 months In Obamaland surveillance on Muslim terror suspects is considered Islamaphobia, surveillance on Black Lives Matter riots is considered racism, but surveillance on law-abiding gun owners is an important crime-fighting tool. It turns out that federal agents have been spying on customers at guns shows and tracking their movements. Why? Because the current administration is hostile to legal gun ownership and completely inept.The Wall Street Journal originally broke this story but they have a stupid business model and put the article behind a pay wall. Thankfully there is this thing called the Internet where all information is available for free and Fox News has the scoop:The first problem you may notice in this illegal surveillance is how insanely pointless the operation is. There was no way this would ever yield any results if you understand California gun law. The Golden State does not have the  gun show loophole  that liberals love to blame for all crimes involving a gun. Even at a gun show, a person purchasing a firearm must undergo a background check and wait 10 before taking possession of the weapon.All gun transfers in California go through a federally licensed firearms dealer with no exceptions. Handgun purchases are limited to one every 30 days and require additional licensing. The state maintains a firearms registry. This is the last place in America where a person would try to make a straw purchase. Even less so for someone trying to buy guns, smuggle them into Mexico, and arm the drug cartels.On top of all that, California also bans many popular handguns and all  assault rifles.  Do the feds really think there is a vibrant black market in Mexico for California-compliant weapons? Apparently so.And despite the feds  claim, this was completely illegal it is most certainly not. The government can t just start spying on Americans without probable cause that a crime is being committed. The feds went fishing here and they forgot to bring bait, rods, and reels. They also didn t pick a spot with any fish.If the feds want to know how guns are getting from the US to Mexico they should go ask former Attorney General Eric Holder who green-lit Operation Fast and Furious. In that, the BATF let guns  go walking  from US gun stores right into the hands of the Mexican drug cartels. One of those guns was used to kill a US border patrol agent.

1668," After Being Handed Yet Another Court Loss, Trump Threatens Revenge In Pure Dictator Style","Donald Trump hates losing. Not because it s a loss to his agenda, or a perceived loss to the American people. Trump hates losing because it hurt his paper thin ego and when he does lose, there s hell to pay (or at least threatened hell to pay). Trump suffered another major loss in court after a 9th Circuit Court judge ruled against his attempt at defundng sanctuary cities. Now, like a true dictator, Trump wants to break up the 9th Circuit.In an interview with the Washington Examiner, Trump said about breaking up the court: Absolutely, I have,  Trump said of considering 9th Circuit breakup proposals during a far-ranging interview with the Washington Examiner at the White House.  There are many people that want to break up the 9th Circuit. It s outrageous. He then accused liberal plaintiffs of court shopping for a more sympathetic body. Everybody immediately runs to the 9th Circuit. And we have a big country. We have lots of other locations. But they immediately run to the 9th Circuit. Because they know that s like, semi-automatic,  Trump said.The 9th Circuit, which covers nine western states and Guam, is based in San Francisco. San Francisco is, of course, one of the sanctuary cities, so plaintiffs didn t have go far to land on their docket.While the 9th has had some liberal rulings:Covering a huge swath of territory   nine western states plus Guam   the San Francisco-based court handles far more cases than any other federal appeals court, including some rulings that have invoked furor from conservatives over the years. Among them: finding that the phrase  under God  in the Pledge of Allegiance is unconstitutional, that the  don t ask, don t tell  policy on gays in the military was problematic long before President Barack Obama s administration ended it, and that states can force pharmacies to dispense emergency contraceptives.Source: Mercury NewsThey are far more balanced than right-wingers would let on.But some legal scholars say the 9th Circuit s liberal reputation is overblown and that the court has moved to the middle as some of President Jimmy Carter s appointees   who were considered extremely liberal   have taken semi-retired  senior  status or passed away. A Democratic Congress nearly doubled the number of judges on the court during Carter s tenure, and his appointees faced easy confirmation in the Senate.President George W. Bush appointed six of the court s 25 active judges, but 18 have been appointed by Democrats, though the seven appointed by President Barack Obama are generally considered moderate, said University of Richmond Law School Professor Carl Tobias.Still, conservatives, and especially Trump, would like nothing more than to make California even less relevant in national politics (a vote in California is worth less than 1/3 of a vote in Wyoming).The bigger picture behind Trump s threat is far more disturbing. We have three (supposedly) co-equal branches of government. Trump is trying to use his executive powers to shut down any dissenting views, even from another branch. Even if you are a Trump voter, you should find this very disconcerting.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images.",News,"April 26, 2017"
23457,Activist: ‘This is where you can make the most impact’,"21st Century Wire says If you ve been following the events outside of Burns, Oregon, you ll have seen 99% of the news coverage has been about the presence of  armed militia  and endless rumors of FBI  Waco Siege  plots   and not about the core legal issues surrounding the Hammond family. These stories often start out as local issues, then quickly spin out of control and end up being managed and contested at the Federal level.Sunday Wire host Patrick Henningsen spoke to independent activist Jason Casella from PANDA UNITE and the Solutions Institute about his recent experience at the Oregon Standoff, and also about America s  crisis of liberty , as well as some positive trends in activism today. Casella advocates getting closer to the sources of power and decision making in your local community: You have to make sure that your city council and county commission is acting on behalf of the people, and acting within the restraints of the Constitution, before you can ask somebody in DC, for example, or even at your state level of representatives.

4212, REPORT: Trump Blocked HIS OWN CAMPAIGN From Vetting His Past,"When one becomes any sort of public figure   especially a political public figure   one s past is often scrutinized. Therefore, it is pretty much standard practice for potential campaign officials to vet the potential candidate prior to launching any sort of run for public office. However, when GOP nominee Donald Trump s original campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, sought to do this, Trump himself pulled the plug on any such endeavor.According to Bloomberg Politics, Lewandowski requested that Trump s past be looked into before he even filed to run for president. However, Trump refused, which means that his campaign officials have been caught completely off guard by things like the lewd tape from the Access Hollywood bus, as well as by the subsequent allegations that he groped multiple women without their consent over the years. Apparently, the same thing happened with Trump s second campaign manager, Paul Manafort. Allegedly, Manafort wanted to vet Trump just like Lewandowski did, but was rebuffed. As a result of this, the only things Lewandowski was prepared to combat were Trump s monetary contributions to Democratic causes and politicians, and his Iraq war comments. All the rest was off limits.This is exceedingly odd, considering that any information found on the part of Team Trump would be used to prepare for any backlash relating to things that might come out from the candidate s past, as has happened in the last week and a half or so. Such secrecy would lead one to believe that there is something out there so bad that Trump feared people bailing on his then-fledgling campaign if they should find out about it.As for Trump s current spin master campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway? Well, she s just as in the dark as her predecessors were. She went on Fox News on Thursday and said of the dumping of information on Trump s past: I don t know what s out there. There s no way to know what is and isn t out there. Ohhh, Kellyanne. Dear, dear Kellyanne. You might not know exactly what else is out there, but you seem to be an intelligent pollster/GOP operative. You can figure it out. And, as a woman and as a mother, you should be ashamed of yourself for continuing to deflect and defend a man whose past includes such behavior.Featured image via Scott Olson/Getty Images",News,"October 13, 2016"

7652, Woman Receives Death Threats After Photo Of Her At Sanders Rally Goes Viral (VIDEO/TWEETS),"An Ohio mother who attended a Bernie Sanders rally has been receiving death threats after a photo of her breast feeding her child went viral.Margaret Ellen Bradford of Barberton, Ohio was at the Sanders rally with her six-month-old daughter Harper. When Harper became hungry, Bradford was standing in the middle of the crowd very close to where Bernie was speaking so she couldn t easily move to a quiet corner to feed her. With Harper crying, Bradford decided to feed Harper in place.It wasn t until later that Bradford realized that someone had taken a photo of her, and it went viral as a result of the hashtag #BoobsforBernie.Some women were very supportive of Bradford:Good for her! Good for Bernie Sanders! Nothing wrong with breast feeding. The ""stigma"" is backwards. #BoobsForBernie https://t.co/d4a0WicGEr  Tina-Desiree Berg (@TinaDesireeBerg) March 4, 2016Frowning down upon breastfeeding is like frowning down on someone for sneezing from their nose. #BoobsForBernie https://t.co/Ae6hPxC1nc  L.e.

Bradford said:  Honestly, I ve cried three times already from some of the hateful messages I ve received, telling me my daughter should be taken away or that I m just an uneducated lowlife hick. There is no reason why something like this should be so unheard of in 2016, because that s what moms do. Society, catch up with biology. It s crazy to think that people are so uncomfortable with something so natural that they would send a young mother death threats. So-called conservatives, especially men in this case, continue to believe they have some right to tell women what to do with their bodies on issues like contraception, abortion, and breast feeding.

20016,YIKES! WHAT THE HECK Did Hillary Just Cough Up Into Her Glass?…And Why Is There An Ambulance In Her Motorcade? [VIDEO],"Hillary was seen passing up a bottle of water in the midst of another one of her coughing fits in front of her press cheerleaders on her new campaign plane yesterday. Passing up a bottle of water in the middle of a coughing fit would seem strange, but what was even more strange is that she passed up a bottle of water for a glass of water that was handed to her by someone on her staff from behind the curtain. Pretty much everything Hillary does is done from  behind a curtain  so the idea that Hillary is likely hiding a serious illness like say .Parkinson s Disease is not really all that far fetched.DOES HILLARY HAVE PARKINSON S DISEASE?As a neurological disorder, Parkinson s disease (PD) has been shown to affect motor skills in the limbs, inhibit muscle coordination, and sometimes contribute to dysphagia.1 Dysphagia is the medical term for difficulty swallowing. Thickened liquids are often used in the management of dysphagia to improve bolus control and to help prevent aspiration. A range of starches and gums has historically been used to thicken liquids. Although thickened liquids improve swallow safety, they appear to have a great potential for unintended physiological consequences.What the heck did Hillary just cough up into her glass during her speech in Cleveland?https://twitter.com/NolteNC/status/773264547813744648Meanwhile a very interesting addition was spotted in Hillary Clinton s motorcade yesterday. There s a probably a perfectly good explanation for an ambulance being added to her motorcade. Maybe it s in case Hillary falls off the stage. She has been stumbling quite a bit and has been seen grabbing on to railings, chairs, tables, or pretty much anything she can get her hands on that helps to keep her upright. But it s only her health and she is only running for President of the most powerful nation on earth so, what difference does that make right?Watch the great coverage of Hillary s pathetic rally in Cleveland yesterday by this young InfoWars reporter.

19980,YIKES! NEW BILL CLINTON RAPE Details Emerge: “Her mouth was all swollen up…It was cut…Her pantyhose were all ripped”,"Hillary s all about protecting women who are victims of rape unless of course her husband is the accused rapist In her first extensive interview in over a decade, the nurse who found Juanita Broaddrick in her hotel room immediately after Bill Clinton allegedly raped Broaddrick recounted what she says she witnessed in that room 38 years ago. She was crying,  recalled Norma Rogers, a nurse who worked for Broaddrick, who at the time was a nursing home administrator volunteering for then-Arkansas Attorney General Bill Clinton s 1978 gubernatorial bid. And the thing I think I remember most is that her mouth was all swollen up. It was cut.   Her pantyhose were all ripped,  Rogers stated in dramatic, lengthy new testimony.Rogers drove Broaddrick back home after the incident. This week, she recounted that emotional drive.  I think we stopped at least twice to get ice. I would go up and get fresh ice and put it on her mouth because she was trying to keep her face from bruising and looking like something bad had happened to her, you know. It was just crazy. The whole situation was just crazy. Rogers was speaking in a lengthy interview on this reporter s talk radio program,  Aaron Klein Investigative Radio,  broadcast on New York s AM 970 The Answer and NewsTalk 990 AM in Philadelphia.Events leading to incidentRogers took listeners back to the spring of 1978 when she traveled to Little Rock for an industry convention along with her nursing home boss, Broaddrick. The two shared a room at the city s Camelot Hotel.In an interview with me in November, Broaddrick herself provided background on her personal encounters with Clinton leading up to that infamous day.Broaddrick said Clinton previously singled her out during a campaign stop at her nursing home.  He would just sort of insinuate, you know when you are in Little Rock let s get together. Let s talk about the industry. Let s talk about the needs of the nursing homes and I was very excited about that. Broaddrick said she finally took Clinton up on that offer when she traveled to Little Rock with Rogers for the convention.Broaddrick says she phoned Clinton s campaign headquarters to inform him of her arrival and was told by a receptionist that Clinton had left instructions for her to reach him at his private apartment. I called his apartment and he answered,  Broaddrick recounted during our November interview.  And he said,  Well, why don t we meet in the Camelot Hotel coffee room and we can get together there and talk.  And I said  That would be fine. Clinton then changed the meeting location from the hotel coffee shop to Broaddrick s room. A time later and I m not sure how long it was, he called my room, which he said he would do when he got to the coffee shop. And he said,  There are too many people down here. It s too crowded. There s reporters and can we just meet in your room? And it sort of took me back a little bit, Aaron,  she said of Clinton s request. But I did say, okay, I ll order coffee to the room, which I did and that s when things sort of got out of hand. And it was very unexpected. It was, you might even say, brutal. With the biting of my lip. In the new interview, Rogers confirmed Broaddrick s version of events:I just know when I left that morning it was my understanding that she was going to be meeting with Mr. Clinton downstairs in the coffee shop for a meeting that they had planned ahead of time to discuss nursing home issues.Bloody lip. Ripped pantyhose. State of shock.Broaddrick previously recounted the aftermath of the incident, when her friend Rogers came back to the room after Broaddrick failed to show up to the convention.In our radio interview, Rogers recounted what she says she saw upon entering the room.I went back to the room and I can t remember if it was because she didn t come down to the meeting because I expected her to have a short meeting and then come to the meeting. And so I went back up to the room and when I went back into the room and she was just very, very upset. She was crying.And the thing I think I remember most is that her mouth was all swollen up. It was cut. And she just told me. She started then telling me the story of how he had just basically overtaken her and bit her lip in order to keep her quiet and to keep her from trying to leave or get away from him. And then she proceeded to tell me that he had pushed her onto the bed, and had raped her.Her pantyhose were all ripped. And she was just in a terrible state. Crying and just, she began telling me, you know, what had happened.But in the meantime she was starting to get her things together and she said we are leaving now. And you know we just started getting our stuff together and I drove her home.Asked whether Broaddrick s lip was bleeding, Rogers replied,  There were obviously open spots where he had bitten her. It was open but not openly bleeding. You know it was just open spots on her lip. Read entire story here: Breitbart News",left-news,"Sep 14, 2016"

Using Open Society as a conduit, Soros has given more than $7 billion to a who s who of left-wing groups. This partial list of recipients of Soros  money says it all:ACORN, Apollo Alliance, National Council of La Raza, Tides Foundation, Huffington Post, Southern Poverty Law Center, Soujourners, People for the American Way, Planned Parenthood, and the National Organization for Women.George Soros wants to curtail American sovereignty: Soros would like nothing better than for America to become subservient to international bodies. He wants more power for groups such as the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, even while saying the U.S. role in the IMF should be  downsized.  In 1998, he wrote:  Insofar as there are collective interests that transcend state boundaries, the sovereignty of states must be subordinated to international law and international institutions. After protesters protested not getting their checks from MORE on May 14th, MORE allegedly distributed the following list as to who was paid to protest in Ferguson and elsewhere, to show where the money had been going.Obviously, as we ve mentioned before, this is far from a  grass roots spontaneous  protest.You can see money paid out to Lisa Fithian, $1,127.75 for  visit expenses .For those who do not know, Lisa Fithian is an infamous leftist organizer. She organized at Occupy, but has been used as a training organizer for many years before that. She spent time in Ferguson in 2014 training people to  simulate chaos. Is it possible that George Soros has a love affair with Lisa Fithian because of their common hatred for Israel?Also of note, you can see that some people are being paid to travel to other places to protest, you can see the travel to Selma, and to D.C., as well as money paid out for  vans , including to a union for providing the vans. Elizabeth Vega got $2000 for  activist trip to Baltimore .There is money paid for protester supplies and protester catering, as well as for video recording of the protests. Some things were not so defined such as $2000 to Taylor Payne for  support .$52,815 is paid to MORE. Money clearly was to go through them to the protesters, according to the protesters during their #Cuthtechecks protest.There are big payouts to Jeff Ordower. Jeff Ordower is a bit like a male Lisa Fithian, he was an organizer for the SEIU and ACORN. He founded MORE and his stated goal is  welcoming co-conspirators in attempts to scale up numbers of radical organizers who can financially support themselves in the work . He is the white man protesters are complaining to in this clip, when they protested not getting paid. He would appear to be disburser of the checks.WCC hot seat pic.twitter.com/Uo65IC2Uuz  Search4Swag (@search4swag) May 14, 2015Brittany Ferrell and Ashley Yates receive thousands on behalf of MAU, Millenial Activists United, one of the protester groups.

7483, The KKK Leader The Media Said ‘Endorsed’ Hillary? Here’s Proof He’s Actually A Trump Voter,"Fox News and other right-wing outlets are quivering with glee at the fact that a known Ku Klux Klan leader is endorsing Hillary Clinton. What they AREN T reporting though is this: the guy is actually a Trump supporter. This  endorsement  is really just an effort to paint Clinton as a racist and damage her brand and her campaign with the dark stain of open and obvious racist terrorism that is the KKK.The outrageous reason for California KKK Grand Dragon Will Quigg to endorse the Democratic frontrunner? He thinks Hillary is a secret racist   even to the point of being in line with the KKK s views. Quigg told the Telegraph of his Clinton  endorsement : She is telling everybody one thing, but she has a hidden agenda. She s telling everybody what they want to hear so she can get elected, because she s Bill Clinton s wife, she s close to the Bushes. Once she s in the presidency, she s going to come out and her true colors are going to show. Border policies are going to be put in place. Our Second Amendment rights that she s saying she s against now, she s not against. She s just our choice for the presidency. So, in other words, this dude is trying to make people think that Hillary Clinton is a racist, immigrant-hating gun nut. Yeah, good luck with that Mr. Quigg. The thing is, though, Quigg s own words show that he isn t truly endorsing Hillary Clinton.

5999, Hillary’s New Ad Brilliantly Uses Those Who Have Endorsed Trump Against Him (VIDEO),"Since the start of Donald Trump s campaign for President of the United States, there s been a heavy amount of racism. For most sane-minded individuals, this racism was obvious and purposeful. Many have been speaking out and standing up against such a blatant disregard for those who have immigrated to the United States from Latin American countries.Through most of Trump s campaign, many of his fellow Republicans have just chosen to ignore the obvious racism, because it became clear that the Republican base of voters wanted this rhetoric as Trump s popularity rose and pushed him into the presumptive nominee spot.It would seem, however, that Trump s latest remarks surrounding the judge that is to preside over the Trump University case, is too much for even high-ranking Republicans who have backed him for the presidency. Trump doesn t believe a judge of Mexican descent should preside over his case. Not only that, he doesn t want a Muslim either. And what next? No women, gay individuals, or any people of color whatsoever?It s become obvious Trump wants a white male America and he s not even hiding it.Noticing the clear disdain for Trump s remarks by his Republican allies was the Hillary Clinton campaign, and they brilliantly put together an ad using all of their words against the presumptive nominee.It may become the most damaging ad yet, as Trump may have finally gone too far for even his own party, with Newt Gingrich, a man who has been rumored to be a potential VP for Trump, saying: This is one of the worst mistakes Trump has made. Watch the brilliant ad here:.@realdonaldtrump s bigoted comments about a Latino judge are so disgusting, even other Republicans are offended.https://t.co/3CEBq2jsDh  Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) June 6, 2016Featured image via video screen capture",News,"June 6, 2016"

7961, BREAKING: Jeb Bush Suspends Campaign Under Pressure From Supporters Of Fellow GOPers,"Jeb Bush was originally the annointed one for the GOP Presidential nomination. However, Donald Trump turned the whole race upside down, and Bush never made it out of the single digits. As the South Carolina Primary draws to a close with yet another poor showing in what is widely seen as one of the most important primaries of the election season, supporters of other GOP candidates urge Bush to drop out. Florida Senator Tim Scott, who is backing Marco Rubio, says of Bush s candidacy and how it affects the GOP s chances at the White House: It s hard to tell you what the Bush camp is thinking. He served as a great governor. I think it d be a great opportunity for him to bring his folks over to the Rubio camp. But the reality is everyone who is running wants to do something good for America, so the question is, once you realize that s not going to happen, what do you do next? It s hard to answer that question unless you re the candidate. Sen. Scott wasn t the only one to call for Bush s withdrawal from the race. His fellow struggling GOP candidate John Kasich had his campaign put out the idea that tonight it became a four-person race  between Trump, Kasich, Rubio, and Cruz. John Kasich strategist and supporter John Weaver said of the South Carolina outcome: Only four candidates have top-three finishes in any of the early states and can justify staying in. At the same time, John Kasich has now won the so-called  Governors Bracket  by continuing to run strong and beat expectations. While others were making their last stand in South Carolina, John Kasich strengthened his organization and support   despite being outspent by tens of millions of dollars. The pressure worked, as Bush has suspended his campaign. So long, Jeb.God bless America indeed.Featured image via Soda Head",News,"February 20, 2016"
5851, Donald Trump’s Negatives Hit Record Highs After Orlando Shooting,"It looks like Donald Trump is having another really bad week. As Americans are coming to grips with the threat of terrorism, gun violence and homophobia after the attack in Orlando, they are also turning their backs on Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.Never mind that the majority of Americans disapprove of how he handled the Orlando situation, a new poll from the Washington Post (the media outlet Trump banned from his camping) shows that Trump s unfavorability rating has reached a record high of 70 percent.As the Post notes: Trump s negative rating is higher now than Clinton s ever have been, even at her highest in unpopularity. According to the findings:The poll finds 70 percent of Americans have an unfavorable view of Trump, including a 56 percent majority who feel this way  strongly.  Negative ratings of Trump are up 10 percentage points from last month to their highest point since he announced his candidacy last summer, nearly reaching the level seen before his campaign began (71 percent).Only 29 percent of Americans have a favorable view of Trump.Here s the damage Trump has done to himself:Trump is even losing support from his biggest base of support: uneducated white men:Among registered voters, Trump s unfavorable mark exceeds Clinton s by 13 points (69 percent vs. 56 percent), a break from a Post-ABC poll last month finding both candidates  standings even at 57 percent unfavorable among this group.Negative views of Trump have risen among a wide range of groups, jumping by double digits among liberals and conservatives and among both Republican women and Democratic men. But his standing has also worsened among two key voting groups: independents and white Americans who do not have a four-year college degree.It looks like the nation is waking up to Donald Trump, and seeing once and for all the mistake that has been made.",News,"June 16, 2016"

Trump has thrown a hissy fit over what he says is Kelly s unfair treatment of him.  What s he afraid of? I m sitting here, I don t feel any fear,  said Moore. Speaking directly to Trump, Moore said: Donald, come now. Come sit beside me, I ll hold your hand, she s fine. She s fine. [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR8s32UCTd4] It was fun watching Moore revel in the glee of Trump and Fox News not getting along. He also enjoyed watching Kelly get under Trump s skin. He said: You have done something that Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, Rubio, Cruz, none of them have been able to do, which is to essentially frighten him, make him run, shut him down. Everyone s tried to do this for months and you did it! This is true. All of the candidates have been lame in standing up to Trump. His unprecedented domination of the debates has seen him not only lead the Republican pack for the nomination, but he has at times obliterated his opponents, especially the squirmy Jeb Bush.Yet, he chose to ditch the debates at crunch time. Moore said: To get elected President in this country, you have to come on this network. You have to play ball with this network. Donald Trump today said  I m not playing with this network.  That s an historic moment, and it s going to be interesting to see where the real power is. Trump thinks he doesn t need Fox News. I think Fox News probably has something else to say about that.

11701,"TJ MAXX AND MARSHALLS Tell Employees To Trash Signs For Ivanka Trump Line, Mix Line With General Merchandise"," According to the New York Times, outlet stores T.J. Maxx and Marshalls have instructed their employees to throw away signs for Ivanka Trump s clothing line, and hang her clothes so that they mix in with other lines.The instruction was to eliminate special displays for the merchandise,  not to remove it from the sales floor,  said Doreen Thompson, a spokeswoman for the TJX Companies, the retailers  parent corporation. We offer a rapidly changing selection of merchandise for our customers, and brands are featured based on a number of factors,  she said.The company did not respond to the New York Times query as to whether or not this kind of handling of product was normal, but one employee came forward and told the paper that after several years of being employed with the stores, she had not been instructed to do this before. -The BlazeTJ Maxx and Marshalls corporate headquarters are located in the very liberal city of Farmington, MA.In the 2016 general election, 75 percent of the 39,722 registered voters in Farmington participated in the presidential election.Of those voters, 20,277 voted for Clinton, with 7,031 for Trump. So it should come as no surprise that the people making the decisions on behalf of the stores would send such an outrageous message to their employees that appears to be intended to harm Ivanka Trump s clothing line. For many shoppers like myself, these new developments as they relate to the trashing of Ivanka Trump s clothing and accessory brand really puts a crimp in my shopping patterns at some of my favorite stores, which include Norstrom and TJ Maxx and the TJ Maxx owned Home Goods store. Gone are the days when these kinds of corporate decisions are made and kept under the radar. Trump has an army of exceptionally loyal supporters who are willing to defend him and his lovely family, even if it means we have to do our shopping elsewhere.In a USA Today article, TJ Maxx CEO Ernie Herrman noted,  We are extremely pleased that our comp store sales growth was almost entirely driven by customer traffic.  Your companies recent decision to trash Ivanka Trump s brand in your store may change that Mr. Herrman Here s a letter to TJMaxx CEO from a leftist in VT that was published in the local Mountain Times newspaper. Editors note: the following is an open letter to Ernie Herrman, CEO and president of TJMaxxDear Mr. Herrman,I am writing to tell you that I have stopped shopping in TJMaxx stores since the election in November of 2016. That is when I became aware that you carry Ivanka accessories. I m sure that you have not missed my 100 or so dollars a month that I would usually spend at your store. But I have missed shopping with you. This is probably hurting me more than it is you. But the real hurt is what is being delivered to our nation by Trump.Let me be very clear: The objective of boycotting is not to destroy your business or to cause job losses. The objective is to send a direct message to you, the CEO, to your Board of Directors, and your stockholders that your merchandising choice regarding Ivanka brand goods needs to change.I know that public pressure and consumer spending has a big effect on markets and policy. Just this week, the CEO of Uber resigned from Trump s Economic Advisory Council. Uber profited from continuing service at JFK airport last weekend when all the NYC cabs boycotted the airport in a show of support for the protesters. Consequently, 200,000 customers deleted their Uber accounts. The CEO decided it wasn t economically advantageous to be aligned with the Trump administration.Recently, the retailers: Shoes.com, Neiman Marcus, and Nordstrom s all cancelled their Ivanka fashion and jewellery line because of public outcry and customer boycotts of their stores.In a consumer based economy, our money has power. So I am asking you to cancel your merchandising of Ivanka accessories. Please let me know as soon as possible when you have done this, so that I can resume shopping at my favorite TJMaxx store.In the meantime, I am going to donate the $100.00 I would have spent at your establishment this month to the ACLU, so that green card holders, immigrants and refugees seeking to enter the US can have some legal representation.Sincerely and respectfully, Your Once Loyal Customer,Candy Jones, Rutland ",politics,"Feb 9, 2017"
2407, Top Conservative Tries To Define ‘Alt-Right’ And Gets It INSANELY Wrong,"One of the problems that Republicans have is what to do about the white nationalists that are taking over the conservative movement, including the KKK and the Neo-Nazis that have come out of the woodwork since Trump began his run for the White House. Some of them are just trying to ignore it, and some are trying to claim that these groups aren t all that bad when you consider that Democrats were once the party of slavery (today s Republicans are those Democrats, actually), so they re the true racists here.And then you have idiots like the executive director of the American Conservative Union, Dan Schneider, who says that the so-called  alt-right  is really the fascist left.Speaking at CPAC, he told an audience full of conservatives: There is a sinister organization that is trying to worm its way into our ranks and we must not be duped. Just a few years ago, this hate-filled left-wing fascist group hijacked the very term  alt-right.  That term has been used for a long time in a very good and normal way. He s right, it s a  sinister organization trying to worm its way into  their ranks. But it s really a fascist left wing movement?Well, let s look at this. The  alt-right  has always been a conservative movement. It was actually conservative opposition to George W. Bush over his foreign policy. These were people who believed that W. was a liberal in conservatives  clothing who had betrayed them with his policies.They originally had some of everything   Reagan Republicans, anti-immigration hawks, libertarians, and even monarchists, and yes, white nationalists. But it wasn t like the left saw an opening, or saw cracks in the movement, and took advantage of them. It was Richard Spencer himself who, during his evolution from a conservative into one of the worst white supremacists we ve got, ultimately hijacked the term and turned it into an anti-Semitic, white nationalist movement.But since this movement now has the door it needs to shove itself into the mainstream via President Asterisk, increasing numbers of Republicans are trying to find ways to distance themselves from that kind of hate. At the same time, some obviously see an opportunity to use it to demonize the left, which riles up a different kind of hate.Schneider also said: They are anti-Semites. They are racist. They are sexist. They hate the Constitution. They hate free markets. They hate pluralism. They hate everything and despite everything we believe in. All of that is true, but they grew out of the conservative right. Not the left, but maybe he s another one of the many ignorant conservatives who believe that today s Democrats are the Democrats who fought for slavery.When you have an entire movement willing to tolerate people like Steve Bannon, Milo Yiannopoulos, Steve Miller and even Trump himself, shucking responsibility for that movement is antithetical to the conservative idea of  personal responsibility.  The GOP needs to look in a mirror if they want to find an answer to the so-called  alt-right. Featured image by Kirk Irwin via Getty Images for SiriusXM",News,"February 23, 2017"
11158,COLLEGE SNOWFLAKES FREAK OUT! “Feel Unsafe” Over VP Pence’s Planned Commencement Speech [Video],"Notre Dame students are freaking out over Vice President Pence s planned commencement speech. Once again, the college snowflakes are trying to shut down free speech. How will these students ever survive in the real world?The college is breaking with a 60-year tradition by not inviting the sitting president to speak. Instead, the University President announced Pence s scheduled visit noting he s a  native son : It is fitting that in the 175th year of our founding on Indiana soil that Notre Dame recognize a native son who served our state and now the nation with quiet earnestness, moral conviction and a dedication to the common good characteristic of true statesmen,  said Notre Dame President Rev. John I. Jenkins, C.S.C.  With his own brand of reserved dignity, Mike Pence instilled confidence on the state level then, and on the world stage now. We are proud to welcome him to represent the new administration. Notre Dame students protesting VP Pence as this year s commencement speaker because it makes them  feel unsafe  pic.twitter.com/W7mJoFp6dV  FOX & friends (@foxandfriends) April 12, 2017 University of Notre Dame students have begun a  #NotMyCommencementSpeaker  white board campaign to protest the invitation of Vice President Mike Pence to speak at Commencement.Last week, seniors Immane Mondane and Jourdyhn Williams invited students to take photos holding white boards with  direct quotes from Pence that are racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, offensive, or ostracizing to members of our community,  along with the hashtag  #NotMyCommencementSpeaker. Alternatively, students could also write about why they  feel unsafe with the presence of Mike Pence on our campus,  with daily opportunities to have photos taken with their whiteboards through the week.Once all the photos have been compiled, the organizers plan to share them on social media in hopes of starting a  discussion  about Pence s invitation. For me personally, Pence represents the larger Trump administration,  Mondane told The Observer.  His administration represents something, and for many people on our campus, it makes them feel unsafe to have someone who openly is offensive but also demeaning of their humanity and of their life and of their identity. While the photos do not appear to have been posted yet, Mondane provided The Observer with several examples of the complaints that students shared.One student used a quote from Pence favoring traditional marriage, writing on their board,  Congress should oppose any effort to put gay and lesbian relationships on an equal status with heterosexual marriage  -Pence #NotMyCommencementSpeaker.

22347,"Washington Post Sloppy ‘Journalism’ Blames Russia for “Fake News” Crisis and Trump’s Win, While Pushing Neo-McCarthyism","Patrick Henningsen 21st Century Wire The mainstream media s post-election hysteria has taken on new level of crazy. It seems that The Washington Post has gone off the deep end this week, claiming that Russia is behind the  fake news  crisis which they claim helped propel an insurgent Donald Trump to victory on Nov 8th, and they are still standing by the official conspiracy theory that Russia has somehow hacked into the US elections. Everything that s wrong with the establishment media is contained within this incredible story The hacking claim is nothing new  backed by the White House and trumpeted by Hillary Clinton, the US mainstream media has claimed that Russia has been hacking and manipulating our US elections. The only problem is it never happened. What s more disturbing though, is the complete collapse in journalistic standards at what used to be considered  America s paper of record. It seems the The Post is playing a key role in waging a new McCarthy-style witch hunt targeting any independent websites which dare to challenge the prevailing anti-Russian party line currently dominating the mainstream political and media establishment   evident beyond any doubt after reading this latest feature in The Washington Post written by Craig Timberg entitled,  Russian propaganda effort helped spread  fake news  during election, Experts say. Experts say ? Make no mistake, this was a true-to-form propaganda piece by the Washington Post, and in itself could be classed as actual  fake news. Not surprisingly, it wasn t difficult to debunk this article. I take no pleasure in saying this, as The Post was once a newspaper I admired growing up, however, what s going on right now with America s mainstream media is nothing short of tragic. More than anything, the 2016 Election showed the world how biased, corrupt and broken America s papers of record have become. Instead of emulating Woodward and Bernstein, it seems most of  the  journalists  are channeling Stephen Glass instead. For those who don t know already, Glass was one of Washington s fake news pioneers of note, writing for the leftwing magazine, New Republic. Glass routinely madeup news stories which his journalism school-trained editors weren t smart enough to pick up on.It s clear that the same partisan Clinton and Democratic Party supporters embedded in the media who were pushing anti-Russian talking points throughout the election cycle   are not giving up. As I pointed out in my pre-election piece entitled,  Hillary s  Russian Hack  Hoax: The Biggest Lie of this Election Season,  what was previously a stance reserved for right-wing neoconservative hawks and Cold War hold-outs has become the new standard for the establishment wing of the Democratic Party   which is the universal demonization of Russia, and the hitlerization of its current president, Vladimir Putin.The mainstream media continues to lower the bar on what it claims is  journalism .  Just when you thought you ve seen the worst, unsourced, completely contrived  investigation,  the Washington Post, which used to be regarded as the paragon of American journalism, has produced a rant of an article that is written as if it were a student submission: The flood of  fake news  this election season got support from a sophisticated Russian propaganda campaign that created and spread misleading articles online with the goal of punishing Democrat Hillary Clinton, helping Republican Donald Trump and undermining faith in American democracy, say independent researchers who tracked the operation. You have to feel bad for The Post s Craig Timberg (photo, left) who seems to have drawn the short straw this week in the anti-Russia propaganda pool at the Post.  According to his biography at the John S. Knight Journalism Fellowship at Stanford, Timberg s primary mission is,  studying potential revenue sources and business opportunities related to foreign news coverage, which he fears is under particular threat from digital disruption of the news industry.  The perfect man for the job.His Thanksgiving Day expos  posits a unified theory of a Trump-Putin axis of evil   an all of the above, buckshot blog post pushed out by the Washington Post (amazing) where Timberg claims The Russians are not only behind the US establishment s latest  fake news  hysteria, but also hacking  both DNC and the US elections, and carrying Donald Trump into the White House.To support his case, Timberg claims that: Two teams of independent researchers found that the Russians exploited American-made technology platforms to attack U.S. democracy at a particularly vulnerable moment, as an insurgent candidate harnessed a wide range of grievances to claim the White House. So The Post claims that the Russians hacked the DNC and US elections systems, engineered Facebook s  fake news  crisis,  which helped get Trump elected. In order to weave all three of these things together, Timberg had to rely on the mainstream media s propaganda weapon of choice: anonymous sources. After that, it was just a case of plugging-in and hyperlinking to previous Washington Post headlines made to look as if these events actually happened, when no evidence exists to date that they ever did:This story was used to great effect by Hillary Clinton herself on national TV during the Presidential debates. The headline is written to give the false impression there was actual proof to back up such profound accusations, but when you actually read the article, there is nothing. It seems that in today s Washington Post, what passes for evidence can be as little as the President accusing Russia of being involved. The statement from the vaunted  intelligence community  is about as vague as it gets, stating, The U.S. Intelligence Community is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from U.S. persons and institutions, including from U.S. political organizations,  said a joint statement from the two agencies.  . . . These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the U.S. election process.  No proof, no evidence, but  they are  confident .  This must be the same sort of confidence these same intelligence agencies had when they briefed Colin Powell about Saddam Hussein s mobile anthrax labs, aka The Winnebagos of Death. Sounds crazy, I know, but it was good enough for the mainstream media in 2002-2003, just like  we are confident  is good enough for the Washington Post today.2.  Russian hackers targeted Arizona election system  (By Ellen Nakashima, Washington Post Aug 29, 2016)Despite the misleading headline, the article does not contain any evidence or anything remotely near  proof  by any normal journalistic standards. But this is not normal journalism. After reading past the colorful headline in the Arizona Russian Hack story, it gets really vague, claiming the FBI s theory that  Russia did it  was,  credible  and significant,  an eight on a scale of one to 10.  It s hard not to laugh when reading some of these mainstream stories. It gets better, saying that,  FBI investigators did not specify whether the hackers were criminals or employed by the Russian government. Bureau officials on Monday declined to comment   What else is this but Washington-based, politically motivated propaganda, designed to scapegoat Russia?By definition, Timberg is using actual fake and misleading news articles (produced by his employer the Washington Post) in order to validate his own unified conspiracy theory. It s hard to tell if Timberg himself is even aware of what he s doing. If not, certainly an argument can be made for mainstream  journalists  who are so ensconced in their own corporate bubble that they actually believe their own organization s propaganda.RELATED: Hillary s  Russian Hack  Hoax: The Biggest Lie of This Election SeasonDespite the best efforts of Hillary Clinton, the Democratic Party, the White House and mainstream media outlets like CNN, ABC, CBS, NBC, MSNBC, the New York Times, The Washington Post, Politico.com and countless other outlets   all of whom either endorsed Hillary Clinton or tailored their news coverage to favor her campaign   with many even colluding directly with the Democratic National Committee (DNC)  to date there is still zero evidence to validate the establishment s official conspiracy theory that Vladimir Putin and the Kremlin master-minded the greatest election heist in modern history. VIRTUAL WITCH HUNT:  PropOrNot.com Deep Throat: The Washington Post s Secret  Source Timberg claims to have a mysterious deep throat  source    apparently these are  researchers  from a group called PropOrNot, a website which just sprung up on October 30, 2016, and who claims to have  proof  that ties together  Fake News /  Pro-Trump  articles online  back to Russia. The only problem is, he can t show us any of their research, nor can he tell us the name of the principal, allegedly because this person fears threats of retribution.  Timberg states,  The way that this propaganda apparatus supported Trump was equivalent to some massive amount of a media buy,  said the executive director of PropOrNot, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid being targeted by Russia s legions of skilled hackers. When you hear things like this in the mainstream media, there is a high probability you are reading an actual government-sponsored propaganda piece.More likely, the only fear ProOrNot s authors have is of being held accountable for their own online smear and propaganda campaign.PropOrNot s web domain registration is also hidden behind  Domains By Proxy,  a company in Scottsdale Arizona.Timberg s  source  is a nameless website, with no author names given, with links to Boycott Russia Today,  and yet, PropOrNot claims to be  a nonpartisan collection of researchers with foreign policy, military and technology backgrounds,  and Timberg says they plan to release their findings on Friday showing the startling reach and effectiveness of Russian propaganda campaigns.  (PropOrNot) planned to release its own findings Friday showing the startling reach and effectiveness of Russian propaganda campaigns,  stated Timberg.Timberg s highly anticipated  release  scheduled for today from the anonymous source doesn t seem to have happened though. A visit to PropOrNot s website Friday shows no such report released. When, or if such a report is actually released by the website, it will certainly be interesting to analyze its findings.UPDATE 11/27/16: The much anticipated groundbreaking report finally arrived and can be found online here and in PDF here. On first glance, it s much worse than we thought, but our analysis is still forthcoming.Thus far the only  investigation  PropOrNot has done was an article implicating the financial news site Zero Hedge posted on Oct 31st and can be found here   a unintelligible mix of websites, speculating that they are somehow linked and in league with the Kremlin. It claims its thesis in corroborated by other sites PropOrNot says are  our allies    similar anti-Russia web sources including the EU Disinformation Review (a  campaign  run by the EU s East StratCom Task force), Polygraph Info (run by US gov t-backed Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and Voice of America), Fake News Watch (home of an extensive virtual book burning list), Stop Fake (Ukraine based, Pro-Maidan), Russia Lies (run by Julia Davis, a  national security expert  behind the tabloid reports alleging foul play in celebrity Britney Murphy s death), and of course no anti-Russian allied list would be complete without Bellingcat (by now a widely discredited, Atlantic Council/NATO-linked, anti-Russian, anti-Syrian,  open source investigation  website, run by Elliot Higgins).The timing of this anti-Russian campaign is no coincidence either. This week the EU passed a new anti-Russian resolution to  counter act  supposed Russian propaganda:  EU strategic communication to counteract propaganda against it by third parties , with 179 voting against it and 208 abstaining. BEWARE: McCarthyism is still in style in 2016 (Image: @21WIRE)PropOrNot s  Executive Summary  (yes, we re trying not to laugh, too) states: Thus far we at PropOrNot have identified over 200 distinct websites which qualify as Russian propaganda outlets according to our criteria, and target audiences in the United States. We estimate the regular US audiences of these sites to number in the tens of millions. We are gathering data to measure that more precisely, but we are confidant that it includes at least 15 million Americans. The McCarthyite tone of their defamation is breathtaking, as the site claims they can spot Russian agents of influence online and collaborator websites through an endless list of  things to look out for :( ) 9. Refer their audiences to each other, via hyperlinks and other means, at disproportionately high rates;10. Are consistently visited by the same audiences, both directly and via search, demonstrating that those intra-network referrals build  brand loyalty  in their audiences over time;11. Are consistently visited by their audiences after searches for terms which congrue with the Russian propaganda  line , and are unrelated to the purported focus of their branding; ( ) I guess it never occurred to these geniuses that people might be loyal followers of well-established alternative websites like AntiWar.com, Counterpunch, Information Clearing House, OpEd News, Activist Post, Global Research.ca, Oriental Review, Truth-Out, Truth Dig, Zero Hedge, Consortium News (run by award-winning US journalist Robert Parry), Ron Paul Institute (former US Congressman) and Paul Craig Roberts (former Cabinet member under President Reagan), to name only a few off of PropOrNot s massive list of alleged  Russian propaganda collaborators. This is basically an amateur attempt to reverse engineer a virtual conspiracy   spuriously connecting 200 popular alternative websites   with a theoretical Russian plot. It should be a cause for concern that The Washington Post is now promoting a  Blacklist  in the spirit of Joe McCarthy s Red Scare.Michael Krieger, editor of Liberty BlitzKrieg, one the sites on PropOrNot s  List  sums up the fundamental flaw in both Timberg and ProOrNot s insular Washington DC-centric mainstream bubble thinking: What s particularly interesting about this list, isn t the fact that a bunch of anonymous whiners decided to demonize successful critics of insane, inhumane and ethically indefensible U.S. government policy, but rather the fact that the Washington Post decided to craft an entire article around such a laughably ridiculous list. This just further proves a point that is rapidly becoming common knowledge amongst U.S. citizens with more than a couple of brain cells to rub together. The mainstream media is the real fake news. Krieger adds:  Unfortunately, this is apparently all we know so far about this shadowy organization, which is simply hilarious considering the group deems any alternative news source that does not agree with the U.S. government narrative to be either outright Russian propaganda, or  useful idiots. Krieger makes an indisputable point though, and one that s also been made by numerous qualified pundits: by far the most prolific purveyor of real fake news and propaganda, especially over the last 30 years   is undoubtedly the US and UK media, and as we can all see   they haven t slowed down.The issue of confirmation bias in western media is chronic, but it s also institutional problem when you consider that many of these mainstream writers are submerged under their own layer of Western-generated American or British propaganda. As a result, they might be completely oblivious of the fact that John Kerry has been caught lying to the world at the UN about what Russia supposedly did in the Ukraine, Crimea, and Syria, or they might have missed UN Ambassador Samantha Power s shrill antics at the UN   an embarrassment to the US in front of a world audience, or Admiral John Kirby s epic meltdown last week after he couldn t defend his own lies to an RT reporter at the US State Department press briefing. On Syria in particular, US politicians have lied so much and so often, that most serious people around the world do not believe a word that comes out of this Administration s mouth   and American and European bloggers most certainly have a right to point this out   not because it pleases Putin  but because they are disgusted with their own government s poor (and highly illegal) conduct on the world stage, especially at this moment in Syria and Yemen. Evidently, none this factors into the reports by Timberg and PropOrNot. Maybe they didn t get the memo either, about the fact that Assad did not  gas his own people  in East Ghouta in August 2013, or any other time that can be proven by his accusers.Many in the US media are simply living inside of their own self-generated, self-reverential propaganda bubble.SEE ALSO: Mainstream Liars Now Want to be Self-Appointed Monarchs of  Truth Even more incredibly, PropOrNot then implores its visitors to only visit get information from US-gov funded news sources like NPR, state-owned media like the BBC, Murdoch-owned and financed outlets like the Wall Street Journal and VICE News, and corporate establishment media sources: We call on the American public to: Obtain news from actual reporters, who report to an editor and are professionally accountable for mistakes. We suggest NPR, the BBC, the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post, Buzzfeed, VICE, etc, and especially your local papers and local TV news channels. Support them by subscribing, if you can! It s pretty incredible to see The Washington Post basing a case on an anonymous website   one which is conducting a virtual witch hunt, clearly with malicious intent (to smear some 200 websites), as a primary journalistic source? Incredible.At this point, everyone should question the political motives of Washington Post staff writer Craig Timberg. It s beyond outrageous even by today s decrepid standards.Judging by the looks of it, PropOrNot itself is a pretty good example of pure black propaganda.Who is behind Timberg s  source  PropOrNot? Is it Timberg himself? Is it run by staff at The Washington Post? As it s so secretive, then you can t rule that possibility out.In true NeoMcCarthyite form, PropOrNot has also issued  The List    a guide to alternative media websites which it accuses of  echo Russian propaganda.  As of today, amazingly, 21st Century Wire.com is not included on their virtual book burning list (but its likely to be after they read this article).Strangely, there is no mention at all by Timberg about a report by BuzzFeed News which identified the primary source of the actual  fake news  flooding Facebook   more than 150 pro-Trump websites being run from a single town, by a cohort of savvy teenagers in Veles, Macedonia   which is not Russia. Granted, Buzzfeed and The Guardian are both establishment media that sometimes produce their own propaganda. However, unless Timberg can refute either the Buzzfeed or The Guardian reports on this subject, or somehow tie his suspected battery of  Kremlin controlled hackers to Veles, then this entire unified conspiracy theory in D.O.A.According to these investigations, the Veles crew are not ideologically motivated, but rather, driven by that old classic   money. They are raking it in with standard Google Ad Sense and other online traffic CPM advertising unit revenue, with incomes ranging from $5,000 to as high as $30,000 per month.  They re not doing it for Mother Russia, but rather for Benjamin Franklin.No CredibilityJust when you thought it couldn t get any worse for PropOrNot, on their front page they posted this: UPDATE: We are publishing our Black Friday Report, adding FAQ entries, updating The List, and more! Please see our latest post for more information. Also, for a sense of what certain kinds of Russian trolls look and sound like in real life, check out this Samantha Bee segment, which cleverly interviews Russian social-media and comment-section propagandists: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OauLuWXD_RI  [PropOrNot links to the Samantha Bee Show]Aside from the fact that this secret Washington Post source would rely on the Samantha Bee Show for anything, the geniuses at PropOrNot seem to have missed the fact that the alleged Russian Trolls were acting for money   they convinced Bee they were a  the real deal  when she approached them via Twitter, where the hoaxer and his female associate were paid $10,000 for appearing on Bee s Full Frontal  show.Bee may have just fell short of a Pulitzer for that one. Example of an actual fake news post on a Facebook news group from the website USINFONEWS.com (Nov. 2016)It s certainly possible that the Macedonia s fake news bedroom empire is being managed by someone higher up the food chain than a cadre of eastern European gamers, but based on their ubiquitous references to breaking FOX News events and nuanced political and emotive button pushing from these faux news sites   it s on the whole much more likely that any alleged  Pro-Trump  hidden hand would be more likely directing their talking points from inside of the United States.Timberg s fake story in The Post was then echoed by Daniel Politi at the popular liberal website The Slate, under the heading,  How Russian Propaganda Used Facebook to Spread Fake News During the Election,  in an attempt to give more credence to Timberg s contrived thesis:Politi says,  .. at least some of the false news that spread in the last few months of the campaign appears to have had much more serious geopolitical implications and was spread thanks to  a sophisticated Russian propaganda campaign,  reports the Washington Post, which cites two recent expert reports on the issue. Again,  expert  claims. Just to remind readers, the first expert is an anonymous Russiaphobic website PropOrNot, while the other  expert  writes for an anti-Russian blog and works for a neoconservative think tank (see Neocon below).Less we forget, The Slate invented a fake story that went viral in October, one which was retweeted by Hillary Clinton herself. Apparently, Clinton s campaign staff fed her planted online news story created by another on The Slate s  journalists  named Franklin Foer, complete with the comical clickbait headline,  Was a Trump Server Communicating With Russia?  Here s Hillary Clinton s tweet of The Slate s own  fake news  story:It's time for Trump to answer serious questions about his ties to Russia. https://t.co/D8oSmyVAR4 pic.twitter.com/07dRyEmPjX  Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) October 31, 2016John Roberts at Forbes explains how The Slate got caught passing off actual  fake news at the height of the election,  The bottom line is that Slate screwed up by publishing this in the first place, and by adding more kooky misinformation to an already addled election season. As for Foer, he says on Twitter a  follow up  piece is in the works. What the difference between The Slate s fake news story and the Macedonian fake Trump stories on Facebook? There is no difference, other than the fact that Hillary Clinton ended up making a fool out of herself by tweeting out  and validating to her millions of followers   a completely make-up, fake news story by The Slate. So Craig Timberg and The Slate are guilty of doing exactly what Timberg and his deep throat  source  PropOrNot are accusing Russia s alleged clandestine Facebook and blogger network of doing   passing around and  echoing fake news. How these  journalists  at The Washington Post and The Slate expect to be taken seriously after this is just beyond the pale.Neocon Think Tanks and other  Experts Craig Timberg s other supporting  evidence  or opinion (it s hard to tell the difference in the Washington Post these days) is being supplied by Clint Watts from the ubiquitously titled, Foreign Policy Research Institute (FPRI), a Cold War era  think tank  (not surprisingly, still stuck in the Cold War), no doubt with links to Washington s intelligence establishment. If that think tank sounds familiar to any neocon fossil hunters, you d know that FPRI is run by none other than John Lehman, one of the original signatories to the neoconservative doctrine of continuous war, Project for a New American Century (PNAC), and a foreign policy advisor to both John McCain and Mitt Romney   two virulent anti-Russian hawks. So it s no surprise then that Timberg is referencing his  expert  Watts, along with co-authors Andrew Weisburd and JM Berger, in an article from the website War On the Rocks, entitled: Trolling For Trump: How Russia is Trying to Destroy Our Democracy.   This is coupled with a related story by Watts and Andrew Weisburd published at the very anti-Russian publication, the Daily Beast, entitled:How Russia Dominates Your Twitter Feed to Promote Lies (And, Trump, Too) Fake news stories from Kremlin propagandists regularly become social media trends. Here s how Moscow does it  and what it means for America s election 2016. Impressive headline, if not a touch Click Bait-y. Once again, the familiar mainstream media pattern of misleading headlines inferring that the article contains actual evidence, and again, the evidence supplied by Watts is that  a lot of people think Russia did it,  claiming that: And the evidence is compelling. A range of activities speaks to a Russian connection: the theft of emails from the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign officials, hacks surrounding voter rolls and possibly election machines, Putin s overt praise for Trump, and the curious Kremlin connections of Trump campaign operatives Paul Manafort and Carter Page. Very  compelling ? Essentially, the above are a series of familiar, albeit recycled, talking points that may as well have beamed-in via John Podesta s personal Blackberry. To Clinton supporters, those talking points sounded plausible a month ago, but even staunch Clintonites are fast abandoning the Russian conspiracy theories. For establishment supporters of Hillary Clinton, that translates as case closed. This is a perfect example of a propaganda bubble, or a self-feeding propaganda loop. Many have argued that it was this sort of delusional incestuous closed loop that inadvertently helped to get Donald Trump elected on Nov 8th.Timberg s source at War On the Rocks also claims that Putin has rebooted the old Soviet  Active Measures  information warfare program designed to  Undermine citizen confidence in democratic governance.  Their evidence: a 1992 document from the US Information Agency, of course, not anything from Russia itself. Again, we ll have to accept the word of the  intelligence community,  because they talked about it back in 1992. The rest of the theory is comprised of a fill-in-the-blanks exercise plugging-in a little Alex Jones for good measure, and various other websites   into a highly creative infographic  proving  the Russians are waging an  Active Measures on Steroid  information warfare against the United States.Here s creative infographic from their website designed to stitch together Watts s elaborate conspiracy theory: Watts also claims that anyone in the West who supports Bashar al Assad in Syria is doing so at the behest of this  Russian Active Measures  operation: When experts published content criticizing the Russian-supported Bashar al Assad regime, organized hordes of trolls would appear to attack the authors on Twitter and Facebook. Examining the troll social networks revealed dozens of accounts presenting themselves as attractive young women eager to talk politics with Americans, including some working in the national security sector. These  honeypot  social media accounts were linked to other accounts used by the Syrian Electronic Army hacker operation. All three elements were working together: the trolls to sow doubt, the honeypots to win trust, and the hackers (we believe) to exploit clicks on dubious links sent out by the first two. This is derivative theorizing that would make even Bellingcat wince. The use of the word  troll  as a generalized pejorative label is buttressed by an even more bias notion that no one in the west would ever be against regime change in Syria, unless they were convinced otherwise by attractive Russian online honeypots. This level of  research  is beyond ridiculous, and yet, this is what passes for a  trusted source  at the Washington Post today.Political Bias: An Occupational Hazzard at The Washington PostIn a previous article, it s just a little too obvious that Timberg can t hold back his disappointment in Hillary Clinton s defeat when you read his headline: Could better Internet security have prevented Trump s shocking win? The election of Republican Donald Trump has stunned Silicon Valley, sparking renewed fears about how the federal government s powerful surveillance machinery could undermine personal privacy   especially in the hands of a man with a history of threatening retaliation against those who challenge him,  claims Timberg.The hysterical lamenting quickly turns to fear mongering: In Silicon Valley, many were dazed after Tuesday s election. Some companies let their employees take the day off or wrote all-staff letters reminding their colleagues of their commitment to inclusive workplaces that protect women, immigrants and minorities. Techies, meanwhile, warned one another on Twitter to begin using privacy and encrypted tools. What is the difference between this politicized diatribe and the fake Macedonia posts on Facebook? There is no difference, they are doing the same thing. What is going on at The Washington Post? It looks like the organization abandoned any pretence of objective journalism.Here you have a writer who is on staff at The Washington Post and a fellow at Stanford University s John S. Knight School of Journalism   trying to posit a unified conspiracy theory that Russia steered the outcome of a US Presidential Election.Timberg is just one of many examples of overtly politically bias writers in mainstream publications, specifically employed by The Washington Post, New York Times, ABC, CBS, CNN and others.  Many were caught working in collusion with the Hillary Clinton campaign, like The Post s  star reporter  Juliet Eilperin who was revealed in an email to have offered John Podesta a  heads up  about a story she was about to publish, even going so far as to provide the Clinton campaign CEO with a brief pre-publication synopsis. Here are a few more famous  journalists  and their corrupted publications guilty of colluding with the Clinton Campaign: Not surprisingly, Timberg then goes on to call the news output of RT (Russia Today)  propaganda,  and goes on to base his value judgment on a Rand Corporation report that describes Russian media as a  propaganda efforts a  firehose of falsehood  because of their speed, power and relentlessness    a report which also claims that Russia attacked neighboring Georgia in 2008, a common western meme, when in reality it was US-backed Georgian military forces that attacked South Ossetia   an obvious point which Timberg seems to have overlooked due to his own confirmation bias. Sadly, this is par for the course with most US media pundits, most of whom do not really care what actually happened, only what Washington s party line is on events.His source, War on the Rocks, continues pushing their conspiracy theory, stating,  But most observers are missing the point. Russia is helping Trump s campaign, yes, but it is not doing so solely or even necessarily with the goal of placing him in the oval office. Rather, these efforts seek to produce a divided electorate and a president with no clear mandate to govern. The ultimate objective is to diminish and tarnish American democracy. I think America has managed to do a pretty good job of that by itself.Decline of the US Mainstream MediaThe loss of credibility is the least of The Post s worries though.The reality is that in an effort to recoup dwindling revenues needed to pay for its inflated salaries and non-investigative  investigations, The Washington Post themselves have had to resort to pushing daily some of the most gratuitous  click bait  stories on the web. Here s one of many daily low-brow items, this  Polar Bear Eats Dog  story is from Tuesday Nov 22nd:If you follow the Post s newsfeed, you will see endless articles like the polar bear story, most of which carry a deceptive headline that does not reflect the story in the article. That s real Click Bait, and it s now their bread and butter.In an age of universal corruption in Washington and rampant collusion between political elites and the US corporate media, it s much easier to scapegoat an existential enemy for every systemic and institutional crisis affecting America. Whole industries have been spun out of this old habit: the intelligence industry, the defense industry, and the new  security  industry   collectively well over a trillion-dollar per year financial concern requires a boogyman in order to justify not only its existence, but also its corporate share prices, and financial growth projections. Now there s a real unified conspiracy theory for you! Maybe Craig Timberg should consider looking into that conspiracy, in the tradition of the former versions of Woodward and Bernstein.Author Jay Dyer explained the current corporate media structure in America today in his article entitled,  The Entire Mainstream Warmongering Media is Fake,  explaining,  Given the mainstream media is almost wholly owned by 6 conglomerates, we can begin to see how the coordination and control once considered a  conspiracy theory  is now made evident. 2012 Ownership Chart (Image Source: Jays Analysis)In 1983, there were 50 and now it is roughly six, with NewsCorp owning the largest papers on three continents. That these facts sound like a  conspiracy theory  can only be presumed from a position of ignorance, especially given the full coordination and deception regarding the Trump   Clinton election of 2016, from rigged polls to Wikileaks revelations of 6o plus top media operatives directly promoting Hillary. Dyer adds,  If the Trump phenomena showed anything, it showed the consensus reality the mainstream media attempted to create concerning Hillary s certain victory, as well as the consensus reality erected for decades, is not omnipotent. In short, the entire US corporate media seems to function with a singular hive mind, aggressively promoting one war after the another, and elevating a new geopolitical foe every few years. This can be explained in part by the defense industry s ownership of US mainstream outlets, and the hundreds of millions dollars these Pentagon-linked companies pour into both TV, print and online ads   none of that explains how editors, writers and producers at these outlets can sit there and still claim they are still performing their duty as part of the Fourth Estate.As it stands, mainstream journalism is truly dead in America.On Oct 9, 2016, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said it accurately: We have witnessed a fundamental change of circumstances when it comes to the aggressive Russophobia that now lies at the heart of U.S. policy towards Russia. It s not just a rhetorical Russophobia, but aggressive steps that really hurt our national interests and pose a threat to our security. What Lavrov didn t say is that it has now reached hysterical proportions in US mainstream media circles, where those who call themselves journalists are willing to present virtually anything and call it reporting, even if it s pure hyperbole, so long as it fulfils the anti-Russian narrative.Unfortunately, The Washington Post continues to be a big part of the problem.READ MORE MSM LIES AT: 21st Century Wire MSM FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE  SUBSCRIBE NOW & BECOME A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",US_News,"November 26, 2016"
7358, Ted Cruz Has A Sickening New Plan For America’s Muslims And It’s Even Worse Than Trump’s,"If ever there was a reminder that Sen. Ted Cruz is NOT the Republican Party s reasonable  alternative to Donald Trump, it s in his response to the Brussels terror attacks. Losing badly to Trump, Cruz is clearly feeling the pressure to capitalize on the tragedy to win some crucial votes   so he s gone all in on xenophobia, totalitarianism, and religious persecution. A hate cocktail sure to fire up his base.In a statement he released on Facebook, Cruz calls for the establishment of ghettos where America s Muslims can be contained and watched over by a specialized law enforcement group meant to police them. If that sounds a little to  Nazi-esque  for you, Cruz preemptively accused his critics of just being too  politically correct  to agree with him.Here s Cruz s terrifying vision for his presidency:We need to immediately halt the flow of refugees from countries with a significant al Qaida or ISIS presence.We need to empower law enforcement to patrol and secure Muslim neighborhoods before they become radicalized.We need to secure the southern border to prevent terrorist infiltration.And we need to execute a coherent campaign to utterly destroy ISIS.In other words, Cruz is plagiarizing Trump s  ban all Muslims  position, but adding that the Muslims already in the country should be  secured  in specific neighborhoods  before they become radicalized.  He doesn t bother clarifying how he would hope to accomplish this. Nor does he mention how he could legally target Muslims who had done nothing wrong just because his prejudice tells him they might some day.Being  Lying Ted  Cruz, he also couldn t help but spread a little misinformation about President Obama as well. Using the president s historic trip to Cuba as a strawman, Cruz bashed him for being on a diplomatic trip while Brussels was attacked, adding that Obama never visited Paris after the terror attacks there. It was an egregious lie, so shameless that a simple picture could debunk it.#COP21 Paying respect : President Obama & French President Hollande lay flowers at Bataclan concert hall in Paris. pic.twitter.com/YEMy7ZUDvk  Catherine Field (@CatherineField) November 30, 2015Needless to say, Muslim activist groups, who have watched in horror as hate crimes directed at Muslim Americans has steadily grown thanks to people like Cruz, were not amused by this latest call to trounce the Constitution based on hate and fear. It s really beyond belief that you have one of the leading presidential candidates calling for law enforcement to target religious communities totally based on the fact that they are of a particular faith,  CAIR spokesman Ibrahim Hooper said by phone.  In normal times, this would be the sort of thing that would disqualify someone from running for dogcatcher, much less president of the United States. We call on voters to reject this.Undoubtedly, terrorism is a serious problem. But the solutions to it need to be much more mature than the Republicans seem to want to believe. Totalitarianism doesn t work   and never has. Discriminating against innocent Muslims because of a twisted death cult based in the Middle East is not only doomed to fail, but could backfire in ways that Cruz and Trump can t fathom from their  build a wall  childish ideology.Between Ted Cruz and Donald Trump, it s hard to say who the bigger xenophobic bigot is. Both are consumed by a hatred towards scapegoated groups they hope to exploit in order to ensure people vote for them. At this point in the race, the two Republican frontrunners aren t just mirroring each other s disgusting policies, but actually driving one another to make them more abhorrent. A nuclear arms race of bigotry in a crucial moment in America s history.Featured image via screenshot",News,"March 22, 2016"
1146," Trump Just Broke A New Record, Finally Has A ‘Win’ That Will Shock America (IMAGE)","Donald Trump doesn t have any legislative wins under his belt yet, but there s one thing he s been really good at   shattering records with his historically low approval rating.Thanks to a new Gallup poll, we now know that Trump s disapproval rating has a three-day rolling average of 60 percent, beating his own previous record. You can check out the stats below:According to Gallup: Trump s approval ratings are also near his administration s low point when looking at the three-day approval ratings Gallup reports daily. For June 10-12, Trump averaged 36% approval, one point above his low of 35% measured March 26-28. Trump s current three-day average of 60% disapproval is, by one point, the highest of his administration. Now that a vast majority of Americans   many of which are probably Republicans or Trump voters   are finally admitting that they want Trump out of the White House, we couldn t be happier. It s clear that Trump s insane Russia scandal is taking a toll on his standing with the country, and his many losses are undoubtedly helping him become more unpopular by the day.These numbers from Gallup come just as the Senate Republicans are trying to roll out another health care bill   which will probably only make Trump s ratings plummet even more, considering how badly the first stab at Trumpcare hurt Trump s ratings.Trump loves boasting about his wins and records, but it s unlikely that he s going to want to brag about the fact that no president in history has gotten so unpopular so quickly   and the chances are, Trump is going to keep going down because he sabotages himself almost every day with his erratic behavior and social media habits. It won t be long before even more of the country turns against him, especially as Trump s Russia investigation is currently heating up.

7614, Trump Has Been Financing The ‘Crown Jewel’ Of His Empire With Money From His Worst Enemy,"Trump bashes China so much and blames them for American problems so often, that if he wasn t such a racist you could arguably say it s the central theme of his presidential campaign. With that in mind, you have to wonder if Trump has some kind of multiple personality disorder. On one hand, he completely savages them with rhetoric every chance he gets. On the other, practically every aspect of his business is dependent on them to survive.As if it wasn t embarrassing enough for him to be busted on live TV for producing his overpriced and gaudy clothing in China, now it turns out that the  crown jewel  of his empire   that being real estate development   is also dependent on Chinese money to survive.A Trump-branded luxury apartment building called Trump Bay Street is being built in New Jersey. The project is receiving substantial funds from Chinese investors. Bloomberg reported that the investors were sold on the idea via a  Sopranos  style video campaign filmed from a moving car with the  Work Up This Morning  theme song from the show playing in the background. I didn t know the Sopranos were so big in China.If the fact he pandered out to Chinese investors wasn t hypocritical enough, this next part really takes the cake.The project was also funded to the tune of $50 million by a controversial visa program that essentially sells legal US residency for immigrants who can front a huge wad of cash. The program is called EB-5, and it allows foreigners who invest at least $500,000 in an American project that will create at least 10 jobs to receive a 2-year visa.The program is intensely popular as a capital source for real estate developers and has ballooned from 5 visas in 2005 to 10,692 in 2014. Approximately 1,200 Chinese millionaires essentially bought a visa while millions of regular immigrants wait patiently to come here legally.The EB-5 program has come under a lot of fire as well, for its ability to be easily exploited by unsavory individuals.In addition to reaching wealthy foreign investors, the program has become a magnet for those seeking to sidestep the scrutiny of the traditional immigration process. In one case, immigration officials pushed through a visa application from Chinese investor in a Las Vegas hotel project despite an internal review that found the investor had previously been turned back at the border, and much of his visa application had likely been fabricated, immigration records show.A Feb. 1, 2013 Homeland Security internal review obtained by ABC News also lays out in stark detail the breadth of the troubles afflicting some of the roughly 600 so-called regional centers   private sector entities certified by Homeland Security to recruit foreign investors for specific business ventures that will qualify for EB-5 visas. The document summarizes 41 investigations, some open and some now closed, into allegations ranging from espionage to fraud to drug trafficking involving investors in various EB-5 investment projects.Source: GawkerTrump has been pissing and moaning about China for literally years now and explained how he will mercilessly beat them up in the name of America if elected president. Meanwhile, he s literally receiving a government handout from them, via a shady visa program that sells a spot in the U.S. for an obscene amount of money.I guess the question is, can he even afford to be tough on China, or will it bankrupt him?Featured image via YouTube",News,"March 8, 2016"
2087, Trump’s SCOTUS Nominee Has DISTURBING History Of Open Misogyny,"We all knew that Donald Trump would be a nightmare for the Supreme Court. His nominee, Judge Neil Gorsuch, is trying to present himself as some sort of legal scholar who will enforce the law fairly regardless of his personal views. However, his past is coming back to haunt him, and it turns out that he is a a misogynistic bastard   and would make horrific decisions when it comes to protecting women s rights in the workplace. In a letter written to the judiciary, a former student of Judge Gorsuch from his days as a law school professor says the following of his views regarding women in the workplace: Judge Gorsuch outlined how law firms, and companies in general, had to ask female interviewees about pregnancy plans in order to protect the company. At least one student countered that an employer could not ask questions about an interviewee s pregnancy plans. However, Judge Gorsuch informed the class that was wrong. Instead Judge Gorsuch told the class that not only could a future employer ask female interviewees about their pregnancy and family plans, companies must ask females about their family and pregnancy plans to protect the company. Another anonymous declaration to the judiciary also confirmed and complained of Gorsuch s views on working women, saying that he said that many female lawyers became pregnant, and questioned whether they should do so on their law firms  dime. This goes against a ruling from the Court in 2003, which says of asking women about deeply personal issues such as family planning, which says: Historically, denial or curtailment of women s employment opportunities has been traceable directly to the pervasive presumption that women are mothers first, and workers second. This prevailing ideology about women s roles has in turn justified discrimination against women when they are mothers or mothers-to-be. This opinion was authored by Chief Justice Renquist, and it went on to say: These mutually reinforcing stereotypes created a self-fulfilling cycle of discrimination that forced women to continue to assume the role of primary family caregiver, and fostered employers  stereotypical views about women s commitment to work and their value to employees. This should come as no surprise; after all, Trump himself, as well as Mike Pence, are huge misogynists. However, it is downright terrifying. If this guy is confirmed to the Supreme Court, he ll turn back women s rights 100 years. And let s not even get started on women s reproductive health. Roe V. Wade will be gone in a heartbeat with this guy.Democrats, if ever there was an important fight to take on, it s this one.

17102,Obama To U.S.Military On Putin: “he did not take my warnings” On Syria…Encourages Russians To “get a little smarter”,"Sarah Palin can hear Putin s knees knocking from her front porch President Obama addressed news that Russian President Vladimir Putin was sending Russian military advisers into Syria to bolster the regime of Syrian President Bashar Assad.Obama explained during a town hall event with members of the military that he warned Putin years ago not to support the tyrannical dictator. I remember a conversation I had with Mr. Putin four or five years ago where I told him that was a mistake   he did not take my warnings and as a consequence things have gotten worse,  he said.Obama said historically, Russia provided a lot of financial support to Assad and sold Syria weapons, even as the dictator continued to alienate his regime from the people. The bad news is that Russia continues to believe that Assad, who is their traditional partner, is somebody that is worthy of continuing support,  Obama said.Obama acknowledged that Putin was now sending more military advisers to Assad as well as more military equipment.

19868,"OBAMA’S CROOKED DOJ HIDES Massive Hillary Scandal: “The U.S. government spent millions of dollars, went all over the world to bankrupt him, and destroyed his life — all to protect Hillary Clinton’s crimes”","The most crooked person to ever run for President The Obama administration is moving to dismiss charges against an arms dealer it had accused of selling weapons that were destined for Libyan rebels.Lawyers for the Justice Department on Monday filed a motion in federal court in Phoenix to drop the case against the arms dealer, an American named Marc Turi, whose lawyers also signed the motion.The deal averts a trial that threatened to cast additional scrutiny on Hillary Clinton s private emails as Secretary of State, and to expose reported Central Intelligence Agency attempts to arm rebels fighting Libyan leader Moammar Qadhafi.Government lawyers were facing a Wednesday deadline to produce documents to Turi s legal team, and the trial was officially set to begin on Election Day, although it likely would have been delayed by protracted disputes about classified information in the case.A Turi associate asserted that the government dropped the case because the proceedings could have embarrassed Clinton and President Barack Obama by calling attention to the reported role of their administration in supplying weapons that fell into the hands of Islamic extremist militants. They don t want this stuff to come out because it will look really bad for Obama and Clinton just before the election,  said the associate.In the dismissal motion, prosecutors say  discovery rulings  from U.S. District Court Judge David Campbell contributed to the decision to drop the case. The joint motion asks the judge to accept a confidential agreement to resolve the case through a civil settlement between the State Department and the arms broker. Our position from the outset has been that this case never should have been brought and we re glad it s over,  said Jean-Jacques Cabou, a Perkins Coie partner serving as court-appointed defense counsel in the case.  Mr Turi didn t break the law .We re very glad the charges are being dismissed. Under the deal, Turi admits no guilt in the transactions he participated in, but he agreed to refrain from U.S.-regulated arms dealing for four years. A $200,000 civil penalty will be waived if Turi abides by the agreement.A State Department official confirmed the outlines of the agreement. Mr. Turi cooperated with the Department s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls in its review and proposed administrative settlement of the alleged violations,  said the official, who asked not be named.  Based on a compliance review, DDTC alleged that Mr. Turi engaged in brokering activities for the proposed transfer of defense articles to Libya, a proscribed destination under [arms trade regulations,] despite the Department s denial of requests for the required prior approval of such activities. Turi adviser Robert Stryk of the government relations and consulting firm SPG accused the government of trying to scapegoat Turi to cover up Clinton s mishandling of Libya. The U.S. government spent millions of dollars, went all over the world to bankrupt him, and destroyed his life   all to protect Hillary Clinton s crimes,  he said, alluding to the deadly Sept. 11, 2012 terrorist attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya.Read more: Politico",left-news,"Oct 5, 2016"
11203,BODY LANGUAGE EXPERT Gives Clear Examples Of Susan Rice Lying About Trump Surveillance During Interview [VIDEO],"Watch the fascinating analysis of Rice s body language here:The latest news from The Daily Caller proves that Susan Rice was lying in her PBS interview:Former President Barack Obama s national security adviser Susan Rice ordered U.S. spy agencies to produce  detailed spreadsheets  of legal phone calls involving Donald Trump and his aides when he was running for president, according to former U.S. Attorney Joseph diGenova. What was produced by the intelligence community at the request of Ms. Rice were detailed spreadsheets of intercepted phone calls with unmasked Trump associates in perfectly legal conversations with individuals,  diGenova told The Daily Caller News Foundation Investigative Group Monday. The overheard conversations involved no illegal activity by anybody of the Trump associates, or anyone they were speaking with,  diGenova said.

Dahir Adan attacked several shoppers with a knife in the St. Cloud, Minnesota mall designated as a  gun free zone. The mall Crossroads Center has a  Code of Conduct  that forbids  firearms or illegal weapons.  There are no reports on whether there were any concealed carry permit holders who were present when the attack occurred but were unable to defend themselves due to mall policy. However, the attack was stopped by an off-duty officer who carried his gun with him, the  gun free  policy notwithstanding.Breitbart News reported the attack occurred between 8:20 and 9 pm local time. ABC affiliate KSTP reports that at least eight people were injured in the attack; the St. Cloud Times notes that one of those eight was admitted to the hospital, while the rest sustained  non-life threatening injuries.  The attack ended when the off-duty officer shot and killed the knife-welding attacker.KSTP confirms the attacker made references to Allah at some point during the attack.They say they are uncertain of motives behind the attack by Dahir Adan, who was killed during the spree by an off-duty police officer.

3148, House Republicans Give Themselves The Power To Slash Pay Of Federal Workers They Don’t Like To $1,"It s only been a couple days since Republicans received massive backlash for trying to gut the Office of Congressional Ethics. Not they are doing something just as despicable.Republicans hate federal workers and Donald Trump s team has been leading a witch hunt demanding names of federal workers who work on climate change and LGBT issues. Clearly, they have something sinister in mind by specifically targeting those federal employees.And under the cover of the uproar over Republican efforts to kill the ethics panel, Republicans passed a rule known as the Holman Rule that gives Republicans the power to target specific individual federal workers and programs.According to the Washington Post,The rule changes the process of passing spending bills by allowing any rank-and-file House member to propose an amendment that would cut a specific federal program or the jobs of specific federal employees, by slashing their salaries or eliminating their positions altogether.Before this rule change, an agency s budget could be cut broadly, but a specific program, employee or groups of employees could not be targeted because of civil service protections.For example, Republicans could use the rule to cut a specific federal worker s pay down to a $1. Yeah, you read that right. One whole dollar.So let s say Republicans find out that a certain federal worker in the Energy Department in studying the effects of climate change. They could persecute that person by cutting their pay to force them to stop doing their job. Or they could cut the pay of a federal land management employee as punishment for protecting public lands from hooligans like the Bundy brothers.It s an absolutely terrifying rule that makes it incredibly clear that Republicans intend to destroy anyone who doesn t agree with them. This is tyranny, pure and simple.Maureen Gilman, who represents 150 federal employees as legislative director for the National Treasury Employees Union, is very concerned. This is part of a very chilling theme that federal workers are seeing right now,  Gilman told the Washington Post.House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer criticized the rule on Tuesday as  shortsighted and ideologically driven changes to our civil service  in step with Republican efforts to use federal employees as scapegoats.Rep. H. Morgan Griffith is the Republican who revived the rule and his opinion on the rule is even more frightening because he compared it to using a sniper rifle against the federal government and admitted that Republicans could use the law to send thousands of federal employees to the unemployment line.He favors a strategic application of the law, likening it to a bullet from a sniper rifle rather than a shotgun. It s unlikely   but not impossible   that members will  go crazy  and cut huge swaths of the workforce, he said. I can t tell you it won t happen,  he said in an interview in his office.  The power is there. But isn t that appropriate?This is yet another outrageous rule Republicans are using to attack the government they despise. It s a way for them to launch personal vendettas and get revenge and anybody who doesn t agree with their extremist ideology is in danger of losing their livelihood. It s an attack that should enrage the American people.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"January 5, 2017"
14736,BREAKING: New CA Law Will Allow Cops To Confiscate Legally Owned Guns,"The drip drip drip of communism in the leftist state of California A new California law scheduled to take effect Friday will allow the police to seize private, legally-owned weapons for up to three weeks without charges or allowing the citizen to contest the seizure.AB1014 was passed last year in the wake of 2014 s Isla Vista shooting, where teenager Elliot Rodger went on a rampage near the campus of the University of California, Santa Barbara, killing six people along with himself.Rodger s parents had reported him to the police prior to the shooting, concerned about his mental health and rants he posted online. But after meeting with Rodger, police decided he wasn t a criminal risk, and consequently didn t search his apartment, where he was stockpiling weapons and ammunition.The new law is intended to stop such a situation from re-occurring. Under the law, a judge has the power to grant a restraining order telling police to seize a person s guns, based solely on accounts from family members or police that the person is poses an imminent danger to others. The restraining order can be granted without the affected person knowing it exists or being allowed time to contest it.Under the law, the factors a judge can consider in granting the restraining order include not only threats of violence, but also prior felony arrests (even without a conviction), evidence of alcohol abuse, and even the simple act of recently purchasing a gun or ammunition.Once granted, police can use the restraining order to confiscate all of a person s guns and ammunition, and the person is also barred from buying or possessing guns and ammo for the duration of the order. A full court hearing must then be heard within three weeks. At that hearing, a judge will be able to extend the restraining order for an entire year. The law gives us a vehicle to cause the person to surrender their weapons, to have a time out, if you will,  Los Angeles Police Department Assistant Chief Michael Moore told Southern California Public Radio.  It allows further examination of the person s mental state. The law expands on California gun laws that are already some of the country s toughest. Police already have the power to seize a person s guns if a licensed therapist informs them that the person s mental state makes them a danger to themselves or others.

Ben Cohen, Jerry Greenfield and North Carolina NAACP President Rev. William Barber kicked off a voter registration drive at North Carolina Central University in Durham on Tuesday to help marshal support against a new North Carolina law requiring voters to present a photo ID before they vote.Proceeds from the sale of the new flavor will also go toward the organization s effort to get  big money donations from corporations and wealthy elites  out of politics. This flavor will benefit the North Carolina NAACP, an organization dedicated to ensuring the political, educational, social and economic equality of rights of all persons and eliminating racial hatred and discrimination,  the ice cream company wrote in a statement on its website. It just felt really good to be working with all these people here in North Carolina, who ve been struggling to get back their right to vote for them and other people of color,  said Ben Cohen.Campaigning against voter suppression is  not something we get to do in Vermont, because they re so white,  he added, chuckling.

His  Cruzin to Victory  tour bus wasn t exactly the epitome of its name, either. While he visited the Johnson County Fairgrounds earlier, it needed to be towed after getting stuck in the mud.This is very ironic, indeed. Just a bit over a week ago Ted Cruz was quoted as saying,  I m not going into the mud with personal insults and attacks (on Donald Trump). Well, Senator, you just went into the mud, quite literally.Pic via InstagramAccording to a report by Phillip Elliott from Time magazine, Cruz had to hitch a ride with aides to his next tour stop while his bus was towed. That s not the kind of image you want to project just before the voters of Iowa nominate the next future President of The United States.

4714, Intelligence Officials SKEWER Trump For Politicizing Classified Briefings,"The latest 2016 developments are completely unprecedented in our nation s history but Donald Trump doesn t care.Despite the fact that classified intelligence briefings are supposed to be kept confidential and neutral during elections, the Republican nominee broke established protocol on Wednesday night and opened his big mouth to make unfounded claims about those meetings.During the Commander-in-Chief Forum on NBC, Trump demonstrated in a single breath that he is totally unfit to be president when he told Matt Lauer that he could tell by the  body language  of those briefing him that don t like President Obama. I was very, very surprised. In almost every instance, and I could tell, I have pretty good with the body language [sic], I could tell, they were not happy. Our leaders did not follow what they were recommending. Not only is Trump trying to destroy the neutrality of the intelligence community, he is trying to use them for his own political gain.And intelligence officials both past and present were quick to slam him for it.Former CIA analyst Paul Pillar told the Washington Post that intelligence officers do not express political preferences during these briefings and they certainly do not use body language. Those selected for this task would have been the most professional of an elite corps of intelligence officers. One of the last things they would do is express either verbally or through body language preferences. Former CIA officer David Priess, who is experienced at delivering briefings was completely disgusting by Trump s claim. We ve had other presidential candidates mention that they got a briefing and talk in platitudes about it. We ve never had somebody talk about what happened in a session. Trump not only blabbed, he told a straight-up lie in order to claim that there is discord between the Obama Administration and the intelligence community, which could create a mistrust that could have serious consequences. In short, this attempt by Trump to score political points is dangerous.Former CIA Director Michael Morell agrees. This is the first time that I can remember a candidate for president doing a readout from an intelligence briefing, and it s the first time a candidate has politicized their intelligence briefing,  he told NBC.  Both of those are highly inappropriate and crossed a long standing red line respected by both parties. To me this is just the most recent example that underscores that this guy is unfit to be commander in chief. Donald Trump is clearly sowing discord between the intelligence community and the current administration at a time when we need both to work together to protect the American people. But that will only get harder because of Trump s unwillingness to keep his mouth shut by making claims he can t prove.Intelligence officials are trained to be neutral and to keep their personal political beliefs out of their assessments. Ultimately, the president has the final say on what action to take on certain intelligence whether intelligence agents agree or not.At this point, Trump has failed to build trust with the intelligence community and that could be a major problem for this country as we seek to prevent future attacks by ISIS. Donald trump is not helping, he is hurting and that is not the kind of president America needs.Featured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images",News,"September 8, 2016"
5267, Senior Intelligence Official Slams Trump To The Ground On Intelligence Briefings,"America s intelligence community doesn t trust Donald Trump. At all. Period. While both Hillary and Trump are slated to start getting intelligence briefings now that they ve formally accepted their parties  nominations, many intelligence officials are very wary of briefing Trump. In fact, one senior official had nothing good to say about Trump when it comes to giving him those briefings.The official spoke to the Washington Post on the condition of anonymity, but didn t mince words at all: I would refuse. He s been so uninterested in the truth and so reckless with it when he sees it. Boom! That s an indictment of Trump s trustworthiness if there ever was one.The official is understandably concerned with Trump s comments about Vladimir Putin, but in addition to that, he s noticed that Trump doesn t want to actually learn anything about, well, anything. He s absurdly stuck on what he thinks are his own merits, and nobody s going to dissuade him from his preconceived notions.Not even intelligence officials.The issue is so volatile and so controversial that the reason these officials talked to the Post on the condition of anonymity was just so they could comment on this. They re that upset with his plea to Russia to hack Hillary s emails, which Trump and his campaign later dismissed as sarcasm and as a call to Russia to turn over any emails they already had. It s clear the intelligence community isn t buying either of those sorry excuses.Some in the intelligence community are also a little wary of Hillary, but Trump is the one who is the loose cannon he claims Hillary is. At least Hillary has extensive experience with intelligence briefings that are far more specific than she ll get as a presidential candidate. Trump has none, and there s absolutely no way, whatsoever, to know how he d handle such information. It s particularly frightening if he thinks that information is juicy; he d probably put it on Twitter for all to see.The official that won t brief Trump said that it s entirely possible Trump will refuse those briefings, because he  already knows all that.  Given that Trump s ego is the size of Russia and growing big enough to make his tiny hands microscopic by comparison, it s not likely he ll refuse them because those briefings will make him feel important.And nothing is more important to Trump than feeling important.Members of the intelligence community aren t the only people worried about Trump getting intelligence briefings. Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid flat-out said he hopes that they ll give Trump fake briefings because he s so untrustworthy. Rep. David Cicilline (D-RI) called on President Obama to deny those briefings to Trump altogether.Considering those briefings happen at the discretion of the sitting president, Obama could very well do it. Trump is a national security disaster waiting to happen. It s really no wonder that officials are nervous about giving him even the broadest of briefings.Featured image by Joshua Lott/Getty Images",News,"July 30, 2016"
5303," Trump Will Not Be Releasing His Tax Returns, And George Will Knows Why"," It has nothing to do with Russia. That s the story the Trump campaign is sticking to. Paul Manafort, Trump s dictator-protecting campaign manager, has doubled down: we are not releasing his tax returns. The reason? His taxes are under audit, so they can t (even though the head of the IRS completely debunked that claim on live national television).For months Democrats and even Republicans have been hounding the  billionaire  mogul to release his tax returns, a standard that every presidential hopeful has met over the last several decades. But Trump seems to be the only one who will not do it. Even Romney, after enough prodding, did it.There s several theories as to why he won t release them. The first is that they will show he s not actually a billionaire. Another is that it will show he has overvalued his properties (which has already been shown he has) and his businesses. The third option is that it will show he paid virtually nothing in taxes, certainly not his fair share.And the fourth (and now most plausible theory): he has ties to Russian interests/oligarchs. That s the theory of conservative columnist George Will. Given that the FBI has a strong case linking Russia to the DNC email hack, and Trump s campaign manager has close ties to Russia, and that Trump has business dealings with the authoritarian country, that theory seems to stick in people s mind. And it should.Trump has been a serial liar throughout this campaign. He s had the audacity to say Hillary Clinton has  taken money  from countries that kill gays and women. But the evidence is starting to show it is Trump who has taken not only taken money, but has offered his soul to a country that also kills gays, women, and anyone who dares to dissent (remember the Winter Olympics controversy)?For a man who claims he wants American sovereignty and autonomy, he certainly has no problem letting his buddies at the Kremlin determine our political discourse.Of course Will s speculation is just that   speculation. But it does raise the question that Trump s refusal to release his tax returns and his love and shady dealings with Russia and Putin may be more than what meets the eye.Like Trump University, this story won t be going away anytime soon. And the Democrats certainly won t be letting it go.This election, it s Trump/Putin 2016.Featured image via Sara D. Davis/Getty Images",News,"July 27, 2016"
19604,Meet The LEFTIST Assistant Professor Who Made Up Bogus List Of “Fake” Conservative Websites That Went Viral,"Approximately one year ago, my business partner sent me a screen shot of a list of  phony  or  not to be trusted  websites  that was going around Facebook. Our website (100percentfedup.com), along with several other conservative websites like Breitbart, IJ Review, Infowars, Biz Pac Review and The Blaze were included on this list. Most of the websites listed had a considerable amount of traffic and cumulatively reach hundreds of millions of readers. I told her to ignore it, that it was clearly created by some leftist organization who was trying to discredit conservative websites. One year later, a list that has striking similarities has been revived. This time however, the list has been amended to include ONE liberal website,  Occupy Democrats  and has a new author, Melissa Zimdars. After all, a list of 90  phony  or  misleading  websites wouldn t be legitimate if at least one of them wasn t a liberal site right?While some of the websites on the list are fake and should be called out as such, there are WAY more legitimate conservative sites on this list who work very hard to vet their sources and to bring their readers truthful news they won t find in the mainstream media. After the election results came in, many on the Left were inconsolable and were lashing out at conservative news sites as the reason Hillary lost. It didn t take long for the Left to realize they had finally met their match with driven conservatives who were not going to roll over and let the Left drive the narrative this time around. Thus the list by Leftist activist Melissa Zimdars, that is being used to discredit many of us who take our jobs very seriously, and are doing all that we can to fight back against a biased media complex.We were curious about Melissa and her political leanings. Could this list have anything to do with wanting to  pay back  the sites who helped to topple Hillary? We did a little research on Melissa and found that her Twitter account is on lock-down. We found this to be slightly ironic considering she appears to be all about transparency. Thanks to Way Back Time Machine, we were able to find out a little bit about Melissa:Melissa is a follower of The Radical  Chicago Rising  and  The End Of Protest  who describes their group as  A new playbook for revolution by Micah White, co-creator of Occupy Wall Street: Melissa is big fan of Black Lives Matter, and was helping to promote the BLM march that threatened the safety and security of many innocent people in Chicago:Here s the real reason why Zimdar likely has her Twitter account on lockdown. She wouldn t want to let everyone know she just published a list of conservative sites that she suggests,  should never be trusted  and allow her hatred for Donald Trump to be exposed at the same time. Besides her hatred for Trump and Karl Rove (see below), she apparently gets  goosebumps  when she hears Bernie Sanders  name. I know what you re thinking She s sounding more  objective  all the time right?Melissa retweeted Hillary s angry tweet about Trump:She s no fan of Dr. Ben Carson and his belief that the government shouldn t be able to force employers to pay an arbitrary minimum wage:Melissa s story became popular after she posted it to her Facebook page, which should come as no surprise given the  friends  who are actively suggesting names of other conservative sites they detest that  Melissa needs to add to the her list. Even though Breitbart is on her  list , Zimdar s friend asks her,  Where s Brietbart? Other friends want to know how they can submit conservative sites that can be added to her list:And of course, what kind of conservative media  hit list  would be complete without Fox News? This friend suggests she needs to put FOX News at the  top  of the list:This Hillary supporter tells Zimdar she d like to use this list as a teaching tool in her class:Just another liberal agitator who plans to use this list to teach her students about honest journalism.Here is Zimdar admitting that not every site is always unreliable, that some,  waffle back and forth .

18662,DEAR MR. PRESIDENT…When We Said “Lock Her Up” We Weren’t Asking [VIDEO],"When he was running for president, Donald Trump made locking up Hillary Clinton for her criminal behavior a centerpiece of his campaign. Just the mere mention of her name would send supporters at his massive rallies into a wild chant, as they screamed,  LOCK HER UP!  Trump s supporters weren t chanting to be cute. Trump supporters were chanting because after decades of evading the law, Americans were quite serious about expecting candidate Donald Trump to follow through on his campaign promise to hold her accountable, and make her pay for her crimes, just like any other American would be expected to do.

1271, Trump Live Tweets About ‘Fox And Friends’ While Mass Shooting In Orlando Unfolds,"Trump spent his second day having a mental breakdown on Twitter with no signs of stopping. Situations around the world are at a particularly dire moment   the Middle East on the brink of war, the terror attack in London, a major infrastructure bill being drawn up   but Trump woke up and immediately turned on the Fox News morning entertainment show, Fox and Friends. Instead of getting his morning intelligence briefing, he live-tweeted incoherently about whatever subjects the Fox hosts brought up.First Trump s Muslim ban Then how Democrats are  obstructing  his ambassadorship picks. (Fact check: They aren t. Trump has nominated almost no one and most spots remain vacant due to his inaction.).@foxandfriends Dems are taking forever to approve my people, including Ambassadors. They are nothing but OBSTRUCTIONISTS! Want approvals.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 5, 2017Finally, he once again viciously lashed out at the Mayor of London Sadiq Khan, taking his original lie and adding even more lies on top to smear the British politician.Pathetic excuse by London Mayor Sadiq Khan who had to think fast on his ""no reason to be alarmed"" statement. MSM is working hard to sell it!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 5, 2017The mayor s  no reason to be alarmed  quote comes from a larger message where he told British citizens that they would be seeing an increased police presence and that the number of cops was  no reason to be alarmed.  Trump stripped the context and pretended the mayor was saying that terror attacks were no reason to be alarmed. Trump said that because on Fox and Friends yesterday a guest made a similar claim. He either hasn t been corrected about the false information he learned on Fox News or doesn t care.Trump did all of this while a mass shooting in Orlando unfolded. Unlike the terror attack in London, this one was a workplace dispute and done with a gun. Five people died.Five people were killed in a shooting at Fiamma, a business on North Forsyth Road near Hanging Moss Road near Orlando, the Orange County Sheriff s Office reported this morning, calling it a  tragic incident. The shooter   a former  disgruntled employee  who was fired in April   then killed himself, shooter, Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said. The shooter had previously been accused of battering a fellow employee.Trump, who needs reasons to justify his Muslim ban, doesn t seem to care much about mass shootings that don t fit the narrative that only scary Islamic terrorists are capable of violence. His silence on the shooting speaks volumes. It was also in stark contrast to his earlier response to London.When a tragedy hit London, he quickly retweeted an unsubstantiated claim made by right-wing conspiracy site, the Drudge Report. He then spent the night and next morning going on a rant about Muslims. He urged people in England to be scared, doing the work of the terrorists for them.In contrast, when a nearly equal number of Americans die in a way that is painfully normal for the country with a major gun violence problem, Trump can t be bothered to even offer condolences. But then, Fox and Friends, which also hates to acknowledge gun violence, probably didn t mention the shooting so how would our president ever know about it?Featured image via Olivier Douliery-Pool/Getty Images",News,"June 5, 2017"

17771,WATCH: SANCTIMONIOUS ANTI-TRUMP Hollywood IMPLODES…Best Friends Turn On Each Other To Save Their Careers and Their New Movie SUBURBICON,"Anti-Trump besties Matt Damon and George Clooney sat down with Good Morning America s Michael Strahan to discuss their good friend, Democrat mega-donor and accused rapist and serial sexual predator, Harvey Weinstein. Not only did both actors, who owe much of their successful careers to Harvey Weinstein, wait until their reputations were on the line to speak out about the sexual predator, but they waited until only days before their new movie,  SUBURBICON  is about to debut, to say that they actually knew more about the abuse women received at the hands of the bully movie mogul than they had previously admitted to.Notably absent in the interview is the third actor Ben Affleck, who completes the trio of bestie actors. After Affleck spoke out on the Harvey Weinstein controversy, he was also accused of covering up Weinstein s behavior, as well as videos that show Affleck used his power to prey on innocent women. Notice how quickly Damon throws Affleck under the bus, saying he knew, but only told Damon (who of course, never told anyone else).Americans who are sick and tired of sanctimonious, holier-than-thou liberals who have no values or morals, yet try to shame Americans for supporting political candidates who don t hold the same liberal views as theirs, are left with only one option #BoycottSuburbicon and #BoycottHollywood In the interview that aired on Monday morning, George Clooney and Matt Damon said that they knew Weinstein was a  bully  and  womanizer  who bragged of bedding actresses but had no idea about the level of criminal behavior that was occurring behind closed doors in hotels.Damon also confessed that he was aware Weinstein had sexually harassed  the first lady of Miramax  Gwyneth Paltrow just before the actress shot the 1996 film adaptation of Jane Austen s  Emma  for the studio. I knew the story about Gwyneth from Ben [Affleck] because he was with her after Brad [Pitt] and so I knew that story,  said Damon. But I was working with Gwyneth and with Harvey on [the 1999 film  The Talented Mr.] Ripley. He then added:   I never talked to Gwyneth about it but Ben told me that whatever or agreement they had come to there was an understanding   and he treated her incredibly respectfully. Always. Affleck and Pitt have not spoken about the incident, and Damon s revelation that he learned about Weinstein s behavior from his friend may cause even more problems for the embattled actor as it seems to contradict his initial statement. I am saddened and angry that a man who I worked with used his position of power to intimidate, sexually harass and manipulate many women over decades,  said Affleck almost one week after news of the scandal broke in a carefully-worded response that seemed to suggest he had never before heard any of the allegations.Damon s decision to characterize the relationship between Paltrow and Weinstein as  always  respectful is a bit odd as well, considering her admission that she had been sexually harassed by the mogul is part of the reason the men were sitting down for the interview.Clooney meanwhile said that like many of Weinstein s victims, he had been told a number of times by the mogul that he was bedding a number of stars. Harvey would talk to me about women that he had had affairs with,  said Clooney. I didn t necessarily believe him quite honestly because to believe him would be to believe the worst of some actresses who were friends of mine, and I didn t really think that they had affairs with Harvey   and clearly, they didn t.He then added:  But the idea that this predator, this assaulter was out there silencing women like that, it s beyond infuriating. And the fact that the story is coming out now and the more it comes out, I want to know all of it. Daily MailWatch, as these two actors desperately attempt to save their upcoming movie,  Suburbicon , as well as their Hollywood careers:""He didn't do it out in the open.""   Matt Damon on Harvey Weinstein: https://t.co/fBSMwurc1A pic.twitter.com/oj1xEPTapz  Good Morning America (@GMA) October 23, 2017 It s indefensible. That s the only word you can start with. Harvey s admitted to it, and it s indefensible. I ve known Harvey for 20 years. He gave me my first big break as an actor in films on From Dusk Till Dawn, he gave me my first big break as a director with Confessions of a Dangerous Mind. We ve had dinners, we ve been on location together, we ve had arguments. But I can tell you that I ve never seen any of this behavior ever.I ve heard rumors, and the rumors, in general, started back in the  90s, and they were that certain actresses had slept with Harvey to get a role. It seemed like a way to smear the actresses and demean them by saying that they didn t get the jobs based on their talent, so I took those rumors with a grain of salt. But the other part of this, the part we re hearing now about eight women being paid off, I didn t hear anything about that and I don t know anyone that did. That s a whole other level and there s no way you can reconcile that. There s nothing to say except that it s indefensible.A lot of people are doing the  you had to know  thing right now, and yes, if you re asking if I knew that someone who was very powerful had a tendency to hit on young, beautiful women, sure. But I had no idea that it had gone to the level of having to pay off eight women for their silence, and that these women were threatened and victimized. I ve been talking with a lot of people about this, and I don t know many people who knew of that.There s an argument that everyone is complicit in it. I suppose the argument would be, that it s not just about Hollywood, but about all of us, that every time you see someone using their power and influence to take advantage of someone without power and influence and you don t speak up, you re complicit. And there s no question about that. ",left-news,"Oct 23, 2017"
14072,BAM! HANNITY UNLOADS On Cruz Over Delegates [Audio],"Wow! Did Hannity go too far with Cruz or did he not go far enough?GOP presidential candidate Texas Senator Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and talk radio and Fox News Channel host Sean Hannity engaged in a testy exchange over the delegate process on Hannity s radio show on Tuesday.Hannity began the interview by asking,  I think the number one question on the minds of Republicans right now is what is going on with the delegates. For example, if you can explain to people that your campaign, that you have every right, within the rules, to talk to candidates, that are pledged on a first ballot, to candidate A or candidate C, you being candidate B. And that   tell us what that process is. Cruz answered that isn t what people are concerned about, and are instead concerned about policy issues and beating Democratic candidate former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Cruz further stated that  the media loves to obsess about process. This process, and this whining from the Trump campaign is all silly. It s very, very simple  . https://youtu.be/En5jPy8SzjUHannity then cut in to say,  I m on social media, with millions of people. I have 550 radio stations. And I have the top-rated cable in my hour, all across the board. And I am telling you, that people are telling me, that they find this whole process confusing.  He further stated that this wasn t a  process question. It s an integrity of the election question. And everybody s asking me this question. So, I want   I m giving you an opportunity to explain it. Cruz responded,  Sean, the only people asking this question, are the hardcore Donald Trump supporters.  Hannity again cut in to ask,  Senator, why do you this? Every single time you you ve got to stop. Every time I have you on the air, and I ask a legitimate question, you try to throw this in my face. I m getting sick of it. I ve had you on more than any other candidate, on radio and TV. So, if I ask you, Senator, a legitimate question to explain to the audience, why don t you just answer it? Cruz then said,  Sean, can I answer your question without being interrupted?  Cruz then talked about the results in Utah, North Dakota, Wisconsin, Colorado, and Wyoming, all of which Cruz has won. He added,  Over 1.3 million people voted in those 5 states. We won all 5. All of this noise and complaining and whining has come from the Trump campaign, because they don t like the fact that they ve 5 elections in a row, that Republicans are uniting behind our campaign. So, they re screaming, on Drudge, and it s getting echoed, this notion of voterless election. It is nonsense. They are making it up. Over 1.3 million people voted. We won landslides in all 5. Cruz continued,  Now, there is a second component, beyond the elections, which is the individual delegates are elected by the people. Donald Trump s campaign does not know how to organize on the grassroots. And so, when the delegates are elected, conservative activists, real conservative activists show up, and they elect delegates, and we are winning those elections over and over and over again. The Donald Trump campaign doesn t know what they re doing. They don t show up. In Colorado, the Donald Trump team was handing out flyers asking their supporters to vote for a slate of delegates, they included Cruz delegates on their slate. They just   they didn t even know how type up a piece of paper without getting it wrong. In Washington state, when Washington state elected their delegates, three days before the election, the Donald Trump campaign, in a panic, realized Washington state was getting ready to elect their delegates. They sent out an emergency email to their Washington supporters, but they screwed up, and sent it to their Washington, DC supporters, instead of their Washington state supporters. I cannot help that the Donald Trump campaign does not seem capable of running a lemonade stand. Elections are won by voters and grassroots activists showing up and voting for the candidate they support. Via: Breitbart News",politics,"Apr 20, 2016"
10250,BROTHER OF SETH RICH Works For Cyber Security Firm…Reportedly BLOCKED Family’s Private Investigator From Determining If Seth Was Wikileaks Source…Refused To Let Investigator See Seth’s Computer: “I already checked it…Don’t worry about it”,"What the heck is going on? Why is the media, who has been virtually silent about former DNC staffer Seth Rich s death until now, coming out to attack President Trump and his administration, accusing them of pushing a false narrative about his murder? Shouldn t every American regardless of political affiliation want to get to the bottom of Rich s suspicious death? Why is there so much secrecy and mystery surrounding the staffer who was getting ready to move over to the Hillary campaign when he was murdered on the streets of DC, only blocks from his home early in the morning, after he was last seen leaving a local bar he frequented. The DC police called it a robbery. The  robbers  didn t take his wallet, the contents of his wallet or his expensive watch.Aaron Rich, who had reportedly been blocking his family s private investigator from looking into whether or not his brother Seth was a WikiLeaks source, works for an influential defense contractor that provides cyber security.According to a source close to the Rich family, Aaron works for Northrup Grumman, which was named as the fifth-largest defense contractor in the world in 2015. The source did not provide what his specific role is at the company. It s not just hacking and defending, there s a lot more to it,  a cyber software engineer at Northrup Grumman says in a video on the company s website.As we previously reported, Aaron Rich was actively attempting to shut down anyone looking into the WikiLeaks connection according to Rod Wheeler, who was brought on as a private investigator in his brother s murder case.Wheeler said that brother Aaron Rich tried to block Wheeler from looking at Seth s computer, even though there could be evidence on it.  He said no, he said I have his computer, meaning him,  Wheeler said.  I said, well can I look at it? He said, what are you looking for? I said anything that could indicate if Seth was having problems with someone. He said no, I already checked it. Don t worry about it. Aaron also blocked Wheeler from finding out about who was at a party Seth attended the night of the murder. All I want you to do is work on the botched robbery theory and that s it,  Aaron told Wheeler, according to Wheeler s claim on the audio. Wheeler said that Seth s father Joel  does not appear to have any hidden agenda. Rich was shot in the back in the early morning hours of July 10, 2016, near his home while he was on the phone with his girlfriend   12 days before the publication of the DNC emails by WikiLeaks. The police initially ruled that it was a botched robbery   but his wallet, watch, and necklace were still on his person when he was discovered by police.Big League Politics has also released an audio recording of journalist Seymour Hersh stating that Seth Rich was in fact WikiLeaks  source.Listen to the Seymour Hersh interview here: All I know is that he offered a sample, an extensive sample, I m sure dozens of emails, and said  I want money.  Later, WikiLeaks did get the password, he had a DropBox, a protected DropBox,  he said. They got access to the DropBox. Hersh also states that Rich had concerns about something happening to him,  the word was passed, according to the NSA report, he also shared this DropBox with a couple of friends, so that  if anything happens to me it s not going to solve your problems,  he added.  WikiLeaks got access before he was killed. For entire story: Big League Politics ",politics,"Aug 2, 2017"

8490, Ammon Bundy Has Suddenly Had A Change Of Heart About That Whole ‘Dying For Freedom’ Thing,"On Tuesday night, seven of the Bundy militants that were previously occupying the Malheur Wildlife Refuge in Oregon were arrested by authorities. What started as a traffic stop devolved into a gunfight with the FBI, in which the  blue tarp man,  LaVoy Finicum, was killed. The five remaining militants with Bundy, one of whom was wounded but survived, were promptly arrested. There were two other militants that were arrested in separate incidents from the one that involved gunfire.That s when it seemed things suddenly became all too real for Ammon Bundy. He, along with his fellow rebels, was arraigned in federal court and held without bail while awaiting trial. The sudden realization of what was happening appeared to knock some sense into his head, prompting Ammon Bundy to call on the remaining militants at the refuge to surrender and leave the compound.Through attorney, Ammon Bundy is telling remaining occupiers in Burns to ""Go home. Hug your families. Let us take it from here.""  Jamie Wilson (@JWilsonreporter) January 27, 2016FBI Special Agent in Charge Greg Bretzing commented that the militants were given  ample opportunities  to leave the occupation peacefully.  Instead, they have chosen to threaten and intimidate the America they claim to love,  he said in a statement during a press conference regarding the arrests and shooting Wednesday.The remaining militants had previously made statements that they were going to resist arrest, with one of them recording a statement that he was going to die fighting while everyone was watching.A check on the militant s YouTube channel shows new video from the compound uploaded as of 1 hour ago at the time of approximately 8:15 pm EST on 1/27, with a live stream scheduled later. From videos uploaded previously, it seems that there is still a small group remaining on-site.Sheriff Dave Ward also made an emotional appeal for an end to the occupation:This has been tearing our community apart. It s time for everyone in this illegal occupation to move on. It doesn t have to be bloodshed in our community. If we have issues with the way things are going in our government, we have a responsibility as citizens to act on them in an appropriate manner. We don t arm up and rebel. We work through the appropriate channels.Source: opb.orgThere are only two ways to end this now.

7514, CBS Reporter Describes Racism At Donald Trump Rallies,"CBS reporter Sopan Deb has been speaking out about the level of racism he has personally encountered at Donald Trump rallies.As Addicting Info reported here, Deb, a U.S. citizen of Indian descent, was arrested earlier this week while covering Donald Trump s canceled IUC rally.His unconstitutional arrest by Chicago police is now helping to draw attention to deeper issues that define the Trump campaign.Deb reports that he has encountered a shocking amount of racism from Trump supporters, during the time he has been assigned to cover Trump s rallies.For example, in January he describes a man accusing him of recording a Trump rally for ISIS. A Trump supporter just asked me at Reno event if I was taking pictures for ISIS. When I looked shocked, he said,  yeah, I m talking to you.  Sopan Deb (@SopanDeb) January 10, 2016He went on to describe the encounter in more detail, writing on Twitter,The man then repeated the accusation multiple times. I told him, politely, I was with CBS and that what he said was inappropriate.  Sopan Deb (@SopanDeb) January 10, 2016The same man then told him  This is America, be glad you re here. I have a couple of guesses what he meant by that,  Deb said on Twitter.He says that during a different rally, held in December, another Trump supporter told him to  Go back to Iraq. It should come as no surprise to anyone to learn that Trump s rallies are a magnet for the lowest common denominator. If there is any sort of diversity among Trump s supporters, it s only in the slight difference between proud white supremacists with swastika tattoos, and semi-closeted racists, who prefer to hide behind crosses while crying that their  traditional Christian values  are under attack. Politically speaking, however, there s very little difference between the Tea Party platform, the platform of the American Nazi Party, that of the KKK or any other white supremacist organization.As the Washington Post reported here, membership in white supremacist groups grew at an enormous rate after the election of President Obama in 2008. There were 194 such groups in 2000, a number that dropped to 149 by 2008, but after President Obama s election, the number jumped to more than 1,000 Trump has capitalized on the right wing s seething race hatred, and in doing so, he s been propelled to the head of race.Knowing that, it s no surprise that the candidate has refused to condemn the KKK, or that white nationalists have been robocalling voters on behalf of his campaign.In 2016, voters will decide which direction our country will move in. Should Donald Trump, or any other right-wing racist win the presidency, racial tensions are likely to explode across the country.Now s the time to keep our country moving forward, challenging racism and right-wing extremism at every turn. A great battle was won during the historic 2008 election of President Barack Obama, but the war is far from over.Image credit: Darron Birgenheier via Flckr; screen capture, Sopan Deb via Twitter",News,"March 13, 2016"

So it has severely curtailed our rights and left us reliant on the government itself for protection.The modern-day massacres are proof beyond a doubt that the government cannot protect us.Daily Caller   Mike Jordan, a Texas man whose son witnessed the church shooting in Sutherland, Texas that took the lives of 26 and injured several more, wore a pretty edgy t-shirt during an appearance on Fox News Monday night.Jordan, who was interviewed by Laura Ingraham about the role guns played in the shooting that left 26 dead, wore a shirt that said,  Buy a gun. Annoy a liberal. Jordan said that his son usually carries but left his firearm at home on Sunday when the shooting took place. A small town like this, you know, people go to church, they disarm, leave their guns in the car, because you don t expect something like this to happen,  Jordan explained.  What if this was the day he didn t leave that firearm at home? What if he did take it with him?

7753, Conservative Christian Leader Admits Liberals Were Right About Evangelicals All Along,"For years, liberals have maintained that evangelicals have only been using religion as a means to achieve absolute power, and now one of their leaders has confirmed it.On Monday, Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention president Russell Moore wrote a column for the Washington Post blasting evangelical Christians for proving liberals right.Donald Trump, despite his more than fleeting flirtation with fascism and his campaign of hate and intolerance, has gained massive support from evangelical Christians who are willing to overlook the Republican front-runner s lack of Christian morals as long it means they get a president who will give them more power. The problem is the behavior of some evangelical leaders,  Moore wrote. I have watched as some of these who gave stem-winding speeches about  character  in office during the Clinton administration now minimize the spewing of profanities in campaign speeches, race-baiting and courting white supremacists, boasting of adulterous affairs, debauching public morality and justice through the casino and pornography industries. Moore wasn t finished though. He also slammed evangelicals, a term he is too embarrassed to use to describe himself any longer, because they are flocking to candidates who pretend to be Christians. I watched one evangelical leader pronounce a candidate a Christian, though he explicitly states that he has never repented of sin, because he displays the fruit of the Spirit in job creation. That s not a political problem; it s a gospel problem.Why are many evangelical leaders, including some who pontificate on nearly everything else, scared silent as evangelicalism is associated with everything from authoritarianism and bigotry to violations of religious freedom? How can they look the other way in silence when politicians praise Planned Parenthood and demur about white supremacists and neo-Nazis? And then he admitted that liberals have been right about evangelicals for years and they have been vindicated by evangelicals who have flocked to Trump s campaign. For years, secular progressives have said that evangelical social action in America is not about religious conviction but all about power. They have implied that the goal of the Religious Right is to cynically use the  moral  to get to the  majority,  not the other way around.This year, a group of high-profile old-guard evangelicals has proven these critics right. Indeed, evangelical Christians have only sought power and they ve had no problem rewriting or flat-out ignoring parts of the Bible that do not fit with their agenda in order to achieve it.It s been all about money and power, and evangelical leaders have fleeced their congregations so they can keep trying to topple the government and establish religious tyranny. But evangelicals have grown more and more desperate over the years as Americans continually reject them and their radical agenda that would confine women to the home and sentence gay people to death as well as declare America a Christian state governed by the Bible instead of the constitutional principles we hold dear.And Donald Trump may not be an evangelical Christian, but evangelicals are increasingly supporting his campaign because he is saying exactly what they want to hear and they see him as their last chance to take power. It s never been about the gospel or morality to evangelicals. It has always been about gaining power and using it to persecute and indoctrinate those they disagree with. And by supporting Trump, evangelicals are telling the world that they are precisely the fake Christians that liberals have been fighting against for decades.Featured image via screen capture",News,"March 1, 2016"

7301, Alabama GOP Gov. Embroiled In Sex Scandal Allegations (NSFW AUDIO),"Another day, another GOP  family values  politician facing a potential sex scandal. Alabama Governor Robert Bentley (R- Of Course) has been accused of having an affair with a woman he describes as his  closest aide.  He has, however conceded that he did have conversations of a sexual nature with his Senior Political adviser, a woman by the name of Rebekah Mason. When news of the scandal broke via a leaked tape Bentley, of course, went into damage control mode and is pretending to be remorseful: Since that time I have apologized to members of my family, to Mrs. Mason and her family and I apologized then for any conversations and behavior then that was inappropriate. Today I want to apologize to the people of the state of Alabama and once again I want to apologize to my family. I am truly sorry and I accept full responsibility. Bentley then went on to re enforce the point that there was no  physical affair  with Mason: I want everyone to know though that I have never had a physical affair with Mrs. Mason. I can assure the people of Alabama I have never done anything illegal. I have never asked any member of my staff or any cabinet member to lie despite what the former ALEA secretary said today. Physical affair or not, that tape was certainly scandalous enough on its own. Here is just one part of that tape: When I m standing behind you, pull you in real close, put my hands on your breasts, put my hands under you .if we gonna do what we did the other day, we re gonna have to start locking the door.  (paraphrased)Here is audio of that tape:Well, that certainly sounds like it went beyond phone sex for sure, but of course there is no way to prove it. Another piece of the scandal is even worse, because it involves the firing of Alabama Law Enforcement Secretary Spencer Collier. Apparently, there was some kind of investigation into the possibility of criminal activity while Collier was in office. Collier, however, tells a different story. He seems to believe he was fired due to his warnings to Bentley regarding the sex scandal and other internal wrongdoing. From Al.com:In denying he has done anything wrong as the state s top cop, Collier on Tuesday and again on Wednesday charged that his agency had come across evidence of an affair between Bentley and Mason, an affair Collier said he warned Bentley that could lead to criminal charges if Bentley were found to have misused state resources in carrying out the relationship.Collier also said Bentley placed him on leave a month ago and then fired him Tuesday because he refused an order by Bentley to lie about why Collier was not to provide a sworn statement to the attorney general s office involving personalities in the criminal case against House Speaker Mike Hubbard.Here is video of Collier speaking on the whole debacle:If this is true, Bentley SHOULD be charged, and Collier should be given his job back. These GOP hypocrites need to ALL be voted out of office come November. They are unfit to serve decent people everywhere.Time to resign, Gov. Bentley. You are a disgrace to the office you hold.Featured image via video screen capture",News,"March 25, 2016"
609," Allies Abroad: Trump Is A ‘Laughingstock,’ Childishly ‘Obsessed With Obama’","Most of us in the U.S. are well aware of Donald Trump s extreme obsession with former President Barack Obama, but now we know that foreign diplomats are privy to that, too. Top-ranking European officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told BuzzFeed News what they think of Trump and what their chief concerns were. Trump s erratic and unpredictable Twitter use was brought up as well. Also discussed was Trump s lack of a strong, experienced team around him.In total, six top European government officials who ve had firsthand dealings on the international stage with Trump and his administration were interviewed by BuzzFeed and their views are consistent.At international gatherings, Trump is described as  something of a laughing stock. Trump could send a tweet in the middle of the night pissing off Kim Jong Un. And the next morning we wake up to a world on the brink of war,  one diplomat said.That observation was made before Trump tried to start a nuclear war on Twitter so we can only imagine how he or she feels now.One of the officials went as far as to say that a small group of diplomats play a version of word bingo whenever Trump speaks because they consider his vocabulary to be so limited.  Everything is  great ,  very, very great ,  amazing ,  the diplomat said of Trump s vocabulary.But there s also a fear among our allies that Trump is dangerous. He has no historical view. He is only dealing with these issues now, and seems to think the world started when he took office,  a diplomat told BuzzFeed News.  He thinks that NATO existed only to keep the communists out of Europe. He has a similar attitude in Asia-Pacific with Japan, ignoring that the US basically wrote their constitution. The diplomats said they also believe that Trump s foreign policy is chiefly driven by an obsession with unraveling former President Barack Obama s policies, and we ve pretty much seen that, too, here in the U.S. It s his only real position,  one official said.  He will ask:  Did Obama approve this?  And if the answer is affirmative, he will say:  We don t.  He won t even want to listen to the arguments or have a debate. He is obsessed with Obama. Another diplomat said that it s impossible to discuss serious international issues, such as Libya, with Trump. They have growing concerns because they re still struggling to find someone in his administration to engage with because meeting with Trump has proved to be  basically useless. He s not the kind of person you can have a discussion about how to deal with [Fayez] al-Sarraj [the prime minister of Libya],  the official added.  So you look for people around him, and that is where it s a problem: The constant upheaval, it s unclear who has influence, who is close to the president. We feel their pain. We witnessed Trump s obsession and profound jealousy of Obama when he tried to claim that our country s first black President is really a sneaky Muslim from Kenya. The former reality show star tried to delegitimize Obama but he failed to do so because facts got in his way. That s still the main problem with Trump. He s adverse to facts. But, he did sell himself on the campaign trail to people who thought they could stick it to liberals by siding with the former reality show star, a man with zero political experience. And here we are, just after 7 months after Trump was sworn in and we could break out in a nuclear war at any minute.

17152,“BLOOD ON THEIR HANDS” FOR VOTING RIGHTS: The Truth About Shocking Number Of Murders By Illegal Aliens In US Hidden By Media And Dems [VIDEO],"It s time to stop hitting the snooze button America! This crisis is no longer on our doorstep it s here. The Democrats, corporations and the Chamber of Commerce want to give these criminals the same rights as you and me Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump deserves credit for forcing all 17 Republican candidates to talk about the social costs of illegal immigration, but it is not  Trump s issue.  We will be making a fatal mistake if we let the media discuss it that way.As Ann Coulter has pointed out, this is the most critical issue of the 2016 race because this is the issue that will define whether or not there will even be an American nation recognizable as the  home of the free and land of the brave. But illegal immigration is not  Ann Coulter s issue  any more than it is  Tom Tancredo s issue.  It is America s issue   not only because it will define America in the 21st Century but because it also defines American elections and who will be voting in elections in 2020 and beyond. It also illuminates the power of the mainstream media to keep issues off the national stage.Think of illegal immigration this way: If the liberal media can keep illegal alien crime out of the  kitchen table debate,  they can keep any issue out of the debate. And they will if they can get away with it. For those reasons, illegal immigration is much more than an issue of public policy; it is the poster child for media malpractice.The media s attempt to suppress public awareness over illegal alien crime and the effects of illegal immigration on American workers  jobs and wages is nothing less than censorship on a massive scale. We need to start talking about it in those terms and hold the media accountable for the lack of ethical standards.The mainstream media   including, sadly, major segments of the presumably conservative media, like the Wall Street Journal   are working overtime to keep the American public and the American voters in the dark on the scope of illegal alien crime. The murder of Kate Steinle in San Francisco exposed only the tip of a massive iceberg, and the media establishment is desperate to avoid dealing with the iceberg underneath.Let s look at a few numbers. You haven t seen them in the New York Times, Atlanta Constitution, or the Miami Herald, nor have they been featured on NBC Nightly news or CNN. So, the average American is blissfully unaware of them.Between 2008 and 2014, 40% of all murder convictions in Florida were criminal aliens. In New York it was 34% and Arizona 17.8%. During those years, criminal aliens accounted for 38% of all murder convictions in the five states of California, Texas, Arizona, Florida and New York, while illegal aliens constitute only 5.6% of the total population in those states. That 38% represents 7,085 murders out of the total of 18,643. That 5.6% figure for the average illegal alien population in those five states comes from US Census estimates. We know the real number is double that official estimate. Yet, even if it is 11%, it is still shameful that the percentage of murders by criminal aliens is more than triple the illegal population in those states.Those astounding numbers were compiled by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) using official Department of Justice data on criminal aliens in the nation s correctional system. The numbers were the basis for a presentation at a recent New Hampshire conference sponsored by the highly respected Center for Security Policy. You can view the full presentation here:The federal Bureau of Prisons category  criminal aliens  includes legal immigrants who have been convicted of serious crimes, but over 90% of incarcerated criminal aliens are illegal aliens, so it is reasonable to use these numbers as a close approximation of the extent of illegal alien crime.Similar data is available at the state level if state officials have the desire to look for it. The Texas Department of Public Safety reports that between 2008 and 2014, 35% of the all murder convictions were illegal aliens averaging 472 murders each year from 2004 to 2008.Do you know the numbers for your state? Does your congressman, Senator, or Governor know those numbers? Of course not. If you are afraid of the answer, don t ask the question.There is widespread public ignorance of illegal alien crime in every state because the mainstream media does investigate such matters. Why? Because they do not want the public to think about such things. The media, from the Associated Press down to the Main Street News, does not even allow the phrase  illegal immigrant  to appear in print.So, the numbers are out there in the criminal justice system and correctional institutions, waiting to be compiled and published. State attorneys general and state legislators could access the data if they were interested, and so could the media, but they don t. In fact, in Colorado in 2006, the state legislature passed a law ordering the state Attorney General to compile accurate data on the costs of incarcerating illegal aliens and send a bill for reimbursement to the federal government. The state AG sent the feds a bill for only half the real costs   the cost of inmates in the state prison system and not the costs imposed on taxpayers by an equal number of inmates in county jails across the state.The US Department of Justice s Bureau of Justice Programs publishes an annual report on the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program, a report that includes data on the number of criminal aliens incarcerated each state prison system and each county jail. It takes some prodigious digging to find the data, but it is there.But our mainstream media, our self-described guardians of the First Amendment, consciously avoids the effort and declines to put a public spotlight on the problem or demand public scrutiny and public accountability. Why?The answer is that public debate on the problem of illegal alien crime does not serve the progressive political agenda. The issue is swept under the rug and anyone who raises it is called a racist.This is media malpractice of historic proportions, and publishers and editors are the unindicted coconspirators in those 7,085 murders.",Government News,"Aug 9, 2015"

23321,Black Student ‘Activist’ Jailed for Tweeting FAKE Racist Threats,"21st Century Wire says What a twisted world we have become.A female, black student activist, Kayla McKelvey (image below), has been jailed for tweeting racially charged threats directed at events that she, herself, was organising and attending. She essentially employed the  false flag attack  model, where one claims to be under attack from another, who in actual fact has nothing to do with it, to further an agenda.The so-called  activist  pleaded guilty to causing false public alarm, but claimed the tweets  were meant to raise awareness of racism on campus .One wonders how much racism there really is on campus, if someone has to deliberately go out of their way to create fake racial threats. This then raises the questions, what exactly did McKelvey hope to achieve by creating a  threat  to black people on campus?The threats caused Kean University to shell out $80,000 in additional security costs, costs that McKelvey will now be forced to repay after her 90 days behind bars.Such actions do absolutely nothing to  raise awareness of racism , and only further racial divides.

8181, Obama Has Something To Say To The Racists Who Didn’t Vote For Him Because He Was Black,"President Obama is nearing the end of his time in office and he s taking stock of everything that has happened since his first election   including a very special message to the people who refused to vote for him based solely on the color of his skin.Back in Illinois to celebrate the ninth anniversary of his entry into national politics, Obama sat down for fascinating interview with Christi Parsons, along with several of Obama s former political mentors. As usual, the President was adamant that the only way forward for America is to end the kind of political partisanship that hampers any progress. Nobody knows this better than he does. The challenges Obama faced as president often came not from natural disasters, hostile enemies, or unforeseen economic setbacks, but simple sabotage from lawmakers who were hoping to score a few cheap political points at the expense of America.This was, after all, the president who dealt with a Congress whose senate leader claimed early into Obama s first term that his number one objective was ensuring Obama lost his next election.But while Obama was characteristically optimistic that America could be better than the ugliness he had seen, it was when the conversation turned to racism that he really delivered the knockout punch. The group was skeptical of whether Obama was the victim of merely partisan bickering or if there was another factor going on. I think they were afraid of you, more so than anybody else. It s one thing   like with George Bush or anybody else, they may think, well, we might suffer through him for two years   or two terms, but I think they were actually afraid of you. They were afraid of you for a couple of reasons. Number one, you were black. And I talk to my Republican friends   and I ve got a lot of them   and that s all they could ever talk about, was the race card, the race. You know,  he s a nice guy,  he s this, he s that, but he s black. Well, get over it. For anyone who has been paying any attention to the way Obama has been treated during his time in office, this should be a familiar story. It s no coincidence that this president is the only one in history to have to deal with years of  serious  reporters on  respected  news networks like Fox (fair and balanced, remember?) suggesting that he might not be from the United States. It s no coincidence that Obama is often depicted at Tea Party rallies in highly racist iconography. Sadly, it may be the 21st century but many Americans still have a HUGE hang up about race.Obama seems aware of all of this, but he turns the tables on the depressing narrative in a brilliant way. Look, I ve always said this, that I have no doubt that there are people who voted against me because of race, or didn t approve of my agenda because of race. I also suspect there were a bunch of people who were excited and voted for me, or I got political benefits because of the notion of the first African American President. So those things cut both ways.I think that a lot of proof that we are a lot further along than we were is I got reelected. So it would be one thing if the first time that it was just an accident. The second time, I won again. And each time I got more votes in consecutive terms. So despite the racism facing him, Obama really has proven just how far America has come. During his first election, nobody knew whether an African-American could successfully be elected. He was. The second election, an unquestionable trouncing of Whitest Guy On Earth Mitt Romney, just proved that things had only gotten better.Obama concludes: So although there s no doubt that there are pockets of the country where some dog whistles blow and there s underlying racial fears that may be exploited, overall, what s more the case I think is just the straight, hardball politics of running against an incumbent and beating the heck out of them and softening them up. Because if a whole bunch of stuff gets done, he s going to get the credit. In other words, after his first election Obama knew that it was time to put up or shut up. The best way to combat the  racial fears  and  dog whistles  was to succeed. It s clear that this strategy has been vindicated. Racism is by no means dead, but Obama s presidency will be defined not in  black and white  terms, but from a long list of victories and accomplishments.No doubt this is rage-inducing for the most racist Americans who had hoped to see the first black president fail. Instead, he proved them wrong and hastened their inevitable extinction. Not bad, Mr. President.Check out the full interview via the LA Times here.Featured image via The White House",News,"February 11, 2016"
17855,WATCH: “NASTY” SAN JUAN MAYOR Continues To Bite The Hand That Feeds The People Who Elected Her,"San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz tore a book from the nasty Democrat women s playbook on Wednesday and wore a black t-shirt emblazoned with the word  nasty  during an interview with Univision s Jorge Ramos. In case anyone forgot, Hillary Clinton actually was called a  nasty woman  by then-candidate Trump during one of the presidential debates. Hillary and her liberal Hollywood friends turned Trump s remark about her into a fundraiser to support abortion. The t-shirt was in response to President Trump s tweet criticizing the politician where he referred to her actions as  nasty  and NOT the mayor. It hasn t taken the American public long to figure out that the mayor of San Juan is not only  nasty , but ungrateful and apparently, someone who just can t get enough attention. Does she really believe that constantly criticizing the President of the United States is going to help the people who are relying on her to speed up or improve the aid they re getting? Cruz told Ramos she wore the shirt because  it was one of the expressions that the president used to describe me. I was a  nasty mayor,  People reported. When it bothers somebody that you re asking for drinking water, medicine for the sick and food for the hungry, that person has much deeper problems than what we can discuss in an interview,  Cruz said.""What is truly 'nasty' is to turn your back on the Puerto Rican people"": mayor of San Juan pic.twitter.com/2GVgJNqmve  Al Punto Univision (@AlPunto) October 5, 2017 What really is nasty is showing your back to the Puerto Rican people,  Cruz added.The island was recently hit by powerful Hurricane Maria and has been working to restore power and clean water to the territory.Cruz criticized the Trump administration s hurricane response to the island. Last Friday, the mayor appeared on television in a black shirt with white letters that read,  HELP US, WE ARE DYING.  Cruz argued that federal aid had been slow to reach Puerto Rico following Maria, which knocked out power to the entire island.In response, Trump tweeted on Saturday,  Such poor leadership ability by the Mayor of San Juan, and others in Puerto Rico, who are not able to get their workers to help.

20080,COMRADES IN LIBERAL MI College Town Filled With Medical Marijuana Stores IGNORE State Law To Punish LEGAL Tobacco Users [VIDEO],"University of Michigan is located in Ann Arbor, MI, and is home to over 43,000 students. Students at U of M and residents of Ann Arbor can purchase legal marijuana on just about every corner. But purchasing legal cigarettes just became a problem for anyone under the age of 21, despite a state law that allows anyone 18 years of age or older to purchase legal tobacco products in the state of Michigan. Why, and how can a city council make these kinds of emotional decisions that supersede state law? Because liberals always know what s best for you There is no room for discussion. Decisions made by progressive government officials don t have to be based on logic, or in this case, on state law; they just have to have enough emotion behind them to sway their comrades on the city council. This story is a perfect example of why Americans need to know who is running for city council in their hometowns and major cities when election time comes around The Ann Arbor City Council last week voted for an ordinance that will ban the sale of tobacco products to people under 21, making it the first city in Michigan to raise the legal purchasing age from 18.Kai Petainen, an Ann Arbor resident who attended the city council meeting, said he recently went to a funeral of a 23-year-old who died from a drug overdose. That friend used tobacco as a gateway drug, he said. It s a funeral of a person who died at only 23 and it was from an overdose. That person began using tobacco at a young age, and eventually they were using other drugs as well,  he said.  Tobacco use can lead to other drugs and it can and does destroy lives. Tobacco shops in Ann Arbor have said the ordinance will drive customers out of the city.The Council voted 9-2 on Aug. 4 for an ordinance sponsored by Council Member Julie Grand, a Democrat representing the city s 3rd Ward.Ann Arbor officials were explicit about their lack of concern with whether the ordinance conflicts with state law, and that they hope the rest of the state follows the city s lead. The tobacco lobby has inflicted enough misery on this country and I m happy to do anything we can to play a leadership role on this effort in Michigan,  Kirk Westphal, a Democratic council member from the 2nd Ward said, according to The Ann Arbor News. It s particularly important to me,  said Council Member Chip Smith, a Democrat from the 5th Ward.  But really what compels me to support this is the fact that Ann Arbor is a leader in things, and this is exactly the type of thing we should be leading on, and I m very happy to support this. In addition to the apparent conflict with a state law preempting local regulations, critics of the ordinance are concerned that its effect would be to send people under 21 to neighboring cities like Ypsilanti or Canton to buy tobacco products.Jack Eaton, a Democrat from the 4th Ward, and Jane Lumm, an independent from the 2nd Ward, voted against the ordinance. According to The Ann Arbor News, they cited Michigan s Tobacco Products Tax Act of 1993 as the cause for their concern.The act says municipalities  shall not impose any new requirement or prohibition pertaining to the sale or licensure of tobacco products for distribution purposes.    MICapConThis new ordinance that will prohibit the sale of tobacco to anyone under the age of 21 years, goes hand-in-hand with the University of Michigan s NO SMOKING ANYWHERE ON CAMPUS law that went into effect on July 1, 2011.Watch the idiocy of this intrusive campus law explained here:Meanwhile, Michigan State University just made it ILLEGAL to SMOKE TOBACCO IN YOUR OWN PRIVATE VEHICLE as long as you are on campus property!Beginning on Aug. 15, a new tobacco-free policy at Michigan State University will make drivers subject to a $150 fine for choosing to smoke or chew tobacco while traveling on public roads that cross the school s East Lansing campus.The ordinance was passed by the board of trustees on June 17, 2015. Its effective date was set for more than a year later on Aug. 15, 2016. A new policy is an effective, cost-efficient way to protect the health of the campus community and encourage tobacco users to reduce or eliminate consumption, thus increasing life, longevity and vitality,  the MSU tobacco-free website states.  Most tobacco users want to quit, and tobacco-free environments encourage users to quit and help them maintain a tobacco and nicotine free status. Students and MSU employees could face additional sanctions. Students who continually violate the ordinance could face sanction through the student judicial system, and employees could face repercussions via Human Resources (just as students and employees could for violating any MSU ordinance),  Cody said.The ban also extends to the use of e-cigarettes and smokeless tobacco on campus, including inside a private vehicle.

8251, This State Is About To Let Guns Have More Rights Than Most People,"Just when you think things can t get any more absurd than they already are, Republicans go and prove you wrong. Now, in the state of Michigan, Republicans are pushing for a law that would allow law-abiding  citizens to carry concealed pistols without a government-issued permit.  Who are these legislators that are introducing such absurd legislation? Michigan Reps. Tom Barrett, R-Potterville; Lee Chatfield, R-Levering; Triston Cole, R-Mancelona; and Jim Runestad, R-White Lake.In HB 5301, it states: A person shall not carry a dagger, dirk, stiletto, a double-edged nonfolding stabbing instrument of any length, or any other dangerous weapon OTHER THAN A PISTOL, except a hunting knife adapted and carried as such, concealed on or about his or her person, or whether concealed or otherwise in any vehicle operated or occupied by the person, except in his or her dwelling house, IN HIS OR HER place of business, or on other land possessed by the person. To summarize, knives bad, guns good. Makes sense, right?According to MLive: Cole, author of House Bill 5304, said the current Concealed Pistol License permit requirement in Michigan is a  government over-reach  that places an undue burden on residents who want to defend themselves against criminals.  Criminals don t have to go through a training class and wait for government permission to have a handgun before they commit armed robbery, yet a law-abiding citizen who simply wants the option of self-defense has to jump through all the hoops and pay a price to carry a concealed weapon,  he said in a prepared statement. People who want to ensure the safety of their families against the criminal element should not have to beg for that right,  Cole said. Here s a reminder for Triston Cole: guns safety laws are not  government overreach.  In fact, the Second Amendment calls for a well regulated (ie. well-trained and maintained) militia. The founders didn t write  well regulated  for no reason. They knew an armed populace also needs to be held under certain laws, restrictions and training. If getting a gun permit and/or training is too hard for some folks, maybe they shouldn t have guns, because they apparently don t have the mental capacity to seek a proper permit. This sort of vigilante justice is exactly what s wrong with parts of America. We need more laws, not fewer, and we definitely don t need a bunch of people just going out, buying guns, and carrying them wherever they like.It s amazing, really. Guns and gun owners in Michigan are about to have more rights than women, and the LGBT community. Apparently,  sodomy  is to be labeled a felony in the state and punishable by up to 15 years in prison. And as far as abortion rights for women, here are the restrictions in Michigan:Keep in mind, abortion is legal nationwide, and has been since 1973.It is absolutely outrageous how these Republicans will say that going to get a gun permit is  government overreach,  yet in the same breath go in to people s bedrooms and call them a felon, or into a woman s uterus and call her a murderer.They definitely have their priorities backwards, and should be condemned for this outrageous way of thinking.Featured image: Wikimedia Commons",News,"February 8, 2016"

They ve removed Christianity from school organizations, public places, and now, in the marketing of products specifically related to religious holidays for the Christian consumer Cadbury was inundated with furious comments from customers on Twitter, questioning why the Easter treats simply said  milk chocolate egg  with no mention of the Christian festival. One said:  Some of us want to know why Easter is hidden on the back now? Why change a good thing??  while another commented:  Disgusting you ve dropped the word  EASTER .Cadbury sent endless replies to irate shoppers denying claims that they have a policy to remove the Easter slogan on packaging.They wrote on their Twitter:  Easter s on the back of our packaging with the other product details.Both Cadbury and Nestle denied that they were getting rid of the word  Easter  from their products. The word  Easter  is not included on the front of the packaging for their Mini Eggs Giant Egg or their Dairy Milk Buttons Egg, but  Happy Easter  is branded on a special edition of the Dairy Milk chocolate bar. It s not on the front as the seasonal design shows what it is.  As a seasonal treat the eggs will always be linked with Easter.

6758, New Study Offers Hope In Search For Alzheimer’s Cure,"Alzheimer s Disease is a devastating type of dementia, accounting for 60 to 80 percent of dementia cases, and currently affecting over 5 million Americans. According to the Alzheimer s Association, it is the 6th leading cause of death in the United States, and someone in the U.S. develops the disease every 66 seconds. By 2050, the number of cases is projected to reach 13.8 million.Scientists and researchers have grappled with understanding the disease in a search for a cure since 1906, when German neurologist Dr. Alois Alzheimer discovered the plaques and tangles in the brain of a woman who had died of an unknown mental illness with symptoms of memory loss, difficulty with language, and erratic behavior. Over the progression of the disease, amyloid plaque deposits and neurofibrillary tangles build up in the brain, disrupting connections between nerve cells and ultimately death of nerve cells and brain tissue.A recent study led by scientists from the University of Glasgow in Scotland and Hong Kong University of Science and Technology has produced a potential breakthrough in Alzheimer s disease treatment.In mice with a progressive disease similar to Alzheimer s, the researchers injected a protein called IL-33. Within a week, the memory and cognitive functions of the affected mice improved to normal levels.  The daily protein injections cleared out existing amyloid plaque in the brain of mice and stopped its development. The results have yet to be tested in humans, with no guarantee the protein will have similar results in human trials. A 2014 study estimated positive results from experiments on mice translate to success in humans at a rate of 8 percent.Nonetheless, the study is promising as no cure or treatment is currently available for Alzheimer s disease. Alzheimer s care and other forms of dementia are estimated to cost the United States $236 billion in 2016.Working with the mice, the Scottish and Chinese researchers found the protein, IL-33, promotes the development of microglia, immune cells in the brain, and direct them towards the plaque formed by Alzheimer s disease. The relevance of this finding to human Alzheimer s is at present unclear. But there are encouraging hints,  said Professor Eddy Liew, a leading researcher of the study from the University of Glasgow, in a press release.  For example, previous genetic studies have shown an association between IL-33 mutations and Alzheimer s disease in European and Chinese populations. Furthermore, the brain of patients with Alzheimer s disease contains less IL-33 than the brain from non-Alzheimer s patients. There have been enough false  breakthroughs  in the medical field to caution us not to hold our breath until rigorous clinical trials have been done. The researchers will soon begin the first phase of clinical trials on humans to test the toxicity of the protein IL-33 at the doses used on mice, with the global medical community anticipating with hope for favorable results.Featured Image Courtesy of Flickr",News,"April 22, 2016"

The Charlotte woman said she went to a local McDonald s over the weekend when a woman who is identified as a manager at the store flipped her off, then kept repeating Donald Trump s name, then asked,  Can you say deportation? Can you say that? Can you spell deportation? Wendy Rios told Fox 46 that she filmed the confrontation because she had been treated unfairly there previously. I am the kind of person who thinks,  Treat the person the way you want to be treated,'  Rios said.Rios told WECT that the manager seemed angry when she went to pay at the drive-thru and was yelling at other employees inside the store, but when she asked about her food at the second window, the employee lashed out at her. I asked the employee if my order was ready and the manager asked him what I asked. He told her and she said,  Of course her [expletive] order is ready ,  Rios said.  Then I asked for ketchup and he handed me two packets of ketchup. I asked for more ketchup and the manager yelled at the employee,  What is she still doing here?'  Rios said.  He told her I was asking for more ketchup and she started yelling at me and saying bad words. Rios asked for the manager s name, and a male employee promptly wrote it down but she couldn t read it so she asked again.The manager wrote down her name in big letters on the receipt, Rios recalled, but refused to give her last name, so at that point, the customer pulled out her cell phone.The woman is seen on the video footage giving Rios her middle finger. Can you say, Donald Trump? Donald Trump. Donald Trump, Donald Trump, Donald Trump, Yes, Donald Trump, Donald Trump. Can you say Donald Trump?  the manager asked.  You holding up my line, lady. You can stay there all you want. Can you say deportation? Can you say that? Can you spell deportation?  the woman said.  What you need to do is you need to get the [expletive] on.

18, SNL Hilariously Mocks Accused Child Molester Roy Moore For Losing AL Senate Race (VIDEO),"Right now, the whole world is looking at the shocking fact that Democrat Doug Jones beat Republican Roy Moore in the special election to replace Attorney General Jeff Sessions in the United States Senate. Of course, Moore s candidacy was rocked by allegations of sexually harassing and even molesting teenage girls   and being banned from the mall in his hometown of Gadsden, Alabama for doing so.Even before that, Moore was an incendiary character in Alabama politics, having been removed as Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court not once but twice, and having made statements such as Muslims should not be allowed in Congress and homosexuality should be illegal. Hell, he even said that the last time America was great was when we had slavery. Therefore, he was an extraordinarily damaged candidate as it was. However, despite all of this, Alabama is a deep red state, with many voters agreeing with some of Moore s more extreme positions, and some even insisting that the allegations of sexual misconduct were simply not true. That is why it was such a shock that Doug Jones pulled out a win for that Senate seat.Well, there is one entity that could not resist going all in on the fact that Roy Moore lost this race: Saturday Night Live. While doing a caricature of the results, SNL began, with its Weekend Update host Colin Jost brutally mocking Moore s alleged proclivities fore teen girls: Congratulations to Alabama s newest Senator   not Roy Moore. Doug Jones has become the first Democrat to win a Senate seat in Alabama in over 20 years. Said Roy Moore:  gross, over 20 years? Jost then got in a dig at Trump, for whom Moore s loss was  a humiliating failure, remind everyone what Trump said of Jones  win: The Republicans will have another shot at this seat in a very short period of time. It never ends! Indeed. If the sane people of America have anything to say about it, it will be a very, very long time after 2018 before the GOP is allowed to control anything. Jost continued mocking Trump: That s it? You just went all in for an accused pedophile and when he lost, [you re] just like,  well, we had fun! He could be removed from office tonight and tweet:  Congratulations to Robert Mueller on a great investigation. Had a fun time being president. Catch you on the flippity-flop! #DietCokeTime . Oh, if only that could be our reality, to have Trump congratulating Mueller for removing him and his entire treasonous, criminal administration.

22304,2017 NDAA: Obama Signs “Countering Disinformation and Propaganda Act”,"21st Century Wire says In typical NDAA signing fashion, Obama signed the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) quietly and with little fan fare as Americans are distracted by the mholiday festivities. What dirty tricks can we expect to see in the 2017 NDAA? Coming from the policy makers that struck down the Smith Mundt Act and legalized indefinite detention of Americans in past iterations, we re sure it can t be benign this year. The Hypocrisy of legalizing propaganda (overturning the Smith Mundt Act) then creating an act to counter propaganda: What are we to make of this new  Countering Disinformation and Propaganda Act  included in the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act? The politicians and the mainstream media outlets have shown their cards yet again with a massive contradiction in policy. In one iteration of the NDAA policy makers overturn Smith Mundt thereby legalizing state sponsored propaganda to be used on the citizens of the United States and in the latest iteration we see the NDAA include an act to counter disinformation and propaganda. We can easily make the connection that in the wake of the  Fake News  hash tag war that has been unleashed upon independent media, with FaceBook partnering with government sponsored  Fact Checking  sites and algorithms being put in place to remove so-called  Fake News  from social media feeds, that this latest addition to the NDAA does not bode well for independent media and has massive potential to be abused for political purposes.  Tyler Durden Zero HedgeLate on Friday, with the US population embracing the upcoming holidays and oblivious of most news emerging from the administration, Obama quietly signed into law the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) which authorizes $611 billion for the military in 2017.In a statement, Obama said that:Today, I have signed into law S. 2943, the  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017.  This Act authorizes fiscal year 2017 appropriations principally for the Department of Defense and for Department of Energy national security programs, provides vital benefits for military personnel and their families, and includes authorities to facilitate ongoing operations around the globe. It continues many critical authorizations necessary to ensure that we are able to sustain our momentum in countering the threat posed by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and to reassure our European allies, as well as many new authorizations that, among other things, provide the Departments of Defense and Energy more flexibility in countering cyber-attacks and our adversaries  use of unmanned aerial vehicles. Much of the balance of Obama s statement blamed the GOP for Guantanamo s continued operation and warned that  unless the Congress changes course, it will be judged harshly by history,  Obama said. Obama also said Congress failed to use the bill to reduce wasteful overhead (like perhaps massive F-35 cost overruns?) or modernize military health care, which he said would exacerbate budget pressures facing the military in the years ahead.But while the passage of the NDAA   and the funding of the US military   was hardly a surprise, the biggest news is what was buried deep inside the provisions of the Defense Authortization Act.Recall that as we reported in early June,  a bill to implement the U.S.  very own de facto Ministry of Truth had been quietly introduced in Congress. As with any legislation attempting to dodge the public spotlight the Countering Foreign Propaganda and Disinformation Act of 2016 marks a further curtailment of press freedom and another avenue to stultify avenues of accurate information. Introduced by Congressmen Adam Kinzinger and Ted Lieu, H.R. 5181 seeks a  whole-government approach without the bureaucratic restrictions  to counter  foreign disinformation and manipulation,  which they believe threaten the world s  security and stability. Also called the Countering Information Warfare Act of 2016 (S. 2692), when introduced in March by Sen. Rob Portman, the legislation represents a dramatic return to Cold War-era government propaganda battles.  These countries spend vast sums of money on advanced broadcast and digital media capabilities, targeted campaigns, funding of foreign political movements, and other efforts to influence key audiences and populations,  Portman explained, adding that while the U.S. spends a relatively small amount on its Voice of America, the Kremlin provides enormous funding for its news organization, RT. Surprisingly,  Portman continued,  there is currently no single U.S. governmental agency or department charged with the national level development, integration and synchronization of whole-of-government strategies to counter foreign propaganda and disinformation. Long before the  fake news  meme became a daily topic of extensive conversation on such discredited mainstream portals as CNN and WaPo, H.R. 5181 would task the Secretary of State with coordinating the Secretary of Defense, the Director of National Intelligence, and the Broadcasting Board of Governors to  establish a Center for Information Analysis and Response,  which will pinpoint sources of disinformation, analyze data, and   in true dystopic manner    develop and disseminate   fact-based narratives  to counter effrontery propaganda.In short, long before  fake news  became a major media topic, the US government was already planning its legally-backed crackdown on anything it would eventually label  fake news. * * *Fast forward to December 8, when the  Countering Disinformation and Propaganda Act  passed in the Senate, quietly inserted inside the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) Conference Report.And now, following Friday s Obama signing of the NDAA on Friday evening, the Countering Disinformation and Propaganda Act is now law.* * *Here is the full statement issued by the generously funded Senator Rob Portman (R- Ohio) on the singing into law of a bill that further chips away at press liberties in the US, and which sets the stage for future which hunts and website shutdowns, purely as a result of an accusation that any one media outlet or site is considered as a source of  disinformation and propaganda  and is shut down by the government.President Signs Portman-Murphy Counter-Propaganda Bill into LawPortman-Murphy Bill Promotes Coordinated Strategy to Defend America, Allies Against Propaganda and Disinformation from Russia, China & OthersU.S. Senators Rob Portman (R-OH) and Chris Murphy (D-CT) today announced that their Countering Disinformation and Propaganda Act   legislation designed to help American allies counter foreign government propaganda from Russia, China, and other nations   has been signed into law as part of the FY 2017 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) Conference Report. The bipartisan bill, which was introduced by Senators Portman and Murphy in March, will improve the ability of the United States to counter foreign propaganda and disinformation from our enemies by establishing an interagency center housed at the State Department to coordinate and synchronize counter-propaganda efforts throughout the U.S. government. To support these efforts, the bill also creates a grant program for NGOs, think tanks, civil society and other experts outside government who are engaged in counter-propaganda related work. This will better leverage existing expertise and empower our allies overseas to defend themselves from foreign manipulation. It will also help foster a free and vibrant press and civil society overseas, which is critical to ensuring our allies have access to truthful information and inoculating people against foreign propaganda campaigns. Our enemies are using foreign propaganda and disinformation against us and our allies, and so far the U.S. government has been asleep at the wheel,  Portman said.  But today, the United States has taken a critical step towards confronting the extensive, and destabilizing, foreign propaganda and disinformation operations being waged against us by our enemies overseas. With this bill now law, we are finally signaling that enough is enough; the United States will no longer sit on the sidelines. We are going to confront this threat head-on. I am confident that, with the help of this bipartisan bill, the disinformation and propaganda used against us, our allies, and our interests will fail. The use of propaganda to undermine democracy has hit a new low. But now we are finally in a position to confront this threat head on and get out the truth. By building up independent, objective journalism in places like eastern Europe, we can start to fight back by exposing these fake narratives and empowering local communities to protect themselves,  said Murphy.  I m proud that our bill was signed into law, and I look forward to working with Senator Portman to make sure these tools and new resources are effectively used to get out the truth.

17443,"OBAMA’S RACISM CZAR, “REVEREND” AL SHARPTON CALLS FOR FEDERAL POLICE FORCE","Yeah putting the federal government in charge of our entire police force, sounds like a great idea Al. We re waiting for Al to call for an all black police force next you know, in the name of  fairness. Rev. Al Sharpton called for national policing legislation akin to the Civil Rights Act this morning at the kickoff his National Action Network s annual convention, just after the arrest of a white South Carolina police officer for murder in the shooting of an unarmed black man. There must be national policy and national law on policing,  Mr. Sharpton said.  We can t go from state to state, we ve got to have national law to protect people against these continued questions. Mr. Sharpton s comments, coming on the heels of multiple instances of police killings of unarmed men of color around the country, were met with applause from the crowd and from the dais, which was packed with elected officials including Mayor Bill de Blasio, Congressman Charles Rangel, Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, city Comptroller Scott Stringer and state Comptroller Thomas DiNapoliThe convention kickoff, which featured a ribbon cutting with the lawmakers, came just hours after it was announced last night that North Charleston, S.C., police officer Michael T. Slager would be charged with murder in the death of Walter Scott who can be seen in a widely publicized video running away from Mr. Slager, while the officer shoots into the man s back repeatedly. The video offers a markedly different story than the one Mr. Slager first offered up: that Scott had stolen his taser and left him in fear for his life.Mr. Sharpton praised the city s mayor and police chief for bringing the charges, but said the nation couldn t rely on the judgement of local officials. We commend them, but we cannot have a justice system that hopes we have a mayor in the right city or a police chief,  he said.  We have to have one policy that is national. Mr. Sharpton later noted that the comparatively small town s officials had been braver than police leaders in bigger cities. He has been vocal about his belief that New York City police Daniel Pantaleo should have been charged with a crime in the death of an unarmed black Staten Island man, Eric Garner. A grand jury declined to indict Mr. Pantaleo, spurring protests throughout the city.That death, too, was captured in a widely published video. And though the footage did not lead to any charges, Mr. Sharpton said today the national legislation should focus on  cameras  as well as  accountability. He compared the fight for police reform to the civil rights struggle, noting that activists did not try to fix discrimination in individual states or cities. They fought for a national Civil Rights Act, a national Voting Rights Act. It s time for this country to have national policing,  Mr. Sharpton said.After the ribbon cutting, Mr. de Blasio whose first year in office was dominated by an effort to reform police-community relations after Garner s death and a subsequent City Hall feud with police union leadership said he agreed some kind of national standard should be set. It s a broad point he s making, and I think he way he made the analogy to the Voting Rights Act is the right one. We ve got to figure out how to create the right relationship between police and community,  Mr. de Blasio told reporters.  The vast majority of police do their job well and want to work more closely with the community. Obviously community residents want to work more closely with the police. But we have to create more of a national standard that says we all have to be on the same page. The relationship between Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Sharpton was fodder for his woes with police unions last year: they took umbrage when Mr. Sharpton was seated next to the mayor and Police Commissioner Bill Bratton at a City Hall round table, and dismissed Mr. Sharpton as divisive. A poll later showed voters didn t like the approaches of either Mr. Sharpton or the union leaders and rank-and-file officers who later turned their backs on Mr. de Blasio at the funeral for two slain officers.Today, Mr. Sharpton offered a full-throated defense his relationship with the mayor, saying it was based not on political power but on a long history of working together, citing Mr. de Blasio s support on issues like wage increases and the silent march against stop, question and frisk before his election. He marched with us when other candidates wouldn t.

3204, Kansas Governor Wants To Steal Money From State Investment Fund To Cover Budget Disaster He Caused,"Kansas  economy is imploding, but rather than fix it by repealing his disastrous tax cuts, Governor Sam Brownback wants to raid the state investment fund instead.When Brownback gave a massive tax giveaway to big business and wealthy residents, he destroyed the state government s ability to generate revenues to pay for things like education, which has suffered greatly ever since.The budget shortfall is projected to stand at $930 million by 2018 and it just keeps getting bigger.Brownback and his Republican allies in the state legislature have been desperately trying to fill the massive gap by any means, including auctioning off sex toys and making deep education cuts.In other words, Kansas Republicans refuse to admit they made a mistake by slashing taxes the way they did and basically will do anything to fill the budget hole except reversing the tax cuts.A new idea Republicans have is to raid the state investment fund, which currently stands at over $300 million from money the state put aside to grow with investments in the stock market. This money is supposed to go toward paying for needs the state may have in the future.According to the Wichita Eagle,One source of money that the governor is eyeing is a long-term investment fund, according to Senate Majority Leader Jim Denning, R-Overland Park.Denning said the governor plans on using the roughly $360 million fund  to get out of the crisis  for the next six months  without having to do deep, deep cuts to K-12. The governor s on board and all the budget folks are on board,  Denning continued.  And all the legislators that have read about it   that I ve talked to   they re on board because they know that if we don t do this one-time money with such a short time frame left in fiscal year  17 that we d have to take almost that entire cut to K-12. There s no other place to go. You ve got to take your hat off that they ve looked under another sofa cushion and found another one-time solution. But this one, I think, is important, and I think all the legislators will support it. But that s not true. GOP state Senator Carolyn McGinn, who is the new chair of the Budget Committee, said the idea sounds like a shady pay-day loan. It looks to me like we re taking a payday loan,  she said.  We re borrowing against ourselves again internally, and I think it s just going to put us further away from where we need to get to. Indeed, Brownback and his GOP allies apparently think the only answer to fix their mess is to steal government money from other programs, including money from a tobacco settlement that funds children s programs. They re even considering doubling taxes on people who make under $30,000 a year which would squeeze low income families even more in a state that is waging war on food stamps.The state investment fund would only be a temporary fix for the current fiscal year because while it would close the current $350 million gap, an even bigger gap of $580 million would need to be plugged after July, when the next fiscal year begins. Plus, they would have to pay back the fund if they choose to pay it back at all, which would mean the people of Kansas lose that long-term investment into their state s future.In short, Republicans need to admit they screwed up and reverse Brownback s disastrous tax cuts for the wealthy and big business so they can get their fiscal house in order again without resorting to stealing money from children and the poor.Kansas Republicans should be embarrassed about the budget crisis they caused and they should rectify it by admitting that trickle-down economics do NOT work and reinstate the taxes that should never have been cut in the first place. It s time for big business and the wealthy to start paying their fair share again to save Kansas from utter financial ruin.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,"January 1, 2017"
472, That Time Mike Pence Begged Congress Not To Fund Hurricane Katrina Relief (VIDEO),"Hurricane Harvey devastated Texas on the 12th anniversary of Katrina. And now, Hurricane Harvey is advancing to Louisiana. Katrina was one of the five deadliest storms in United States history, killing nearly 2,000 people as flood walls failed and the levee broke. A whopping 80 percent of New Orleans was under water as people fought to get on their rooftops to survive. Katrina was the deadliest hurricane to hit the U.S. since 1928 and it took days before bodies were discovered, mostly the elderly and disabled.In 2005, Mike Pence, then a Republican congressman from Indiana, who considers himself to be a devout Christian, addressed the issue of funding for the devastated state. Mr. Speaker Katrina breaks my heart. When I consider it s tragic aftermath the ancient parable comes to mind  and the rains descended and the flood came and the winds blew and beat against the house and it fell with a great crash.  For most American families when a tree falls on your house, you tend to the wounded, you rebuild and then you figure out how you re gonna pay for it,  Pence said. Later today Congress will continue the work of funding the relief and recovery from Hurricane Katrina,  he continued.  And well we should by speeding more than $50 billion dollars to FEMA & other agencies, but as we tend to the wounded, as we begin to rebuild, let us also do what every other American family would do in like circumstances, and expects this Congress to do. Let s figure out how we re gonna pay for it. Congress must ensure that a catastrophe of this nature, does not become a catastrophe of debt for our children & grandchildren,  he added, unfortunately.Watch:Video:  Katrina breaks my heart but we must not let Katrina break the bank for our children & grandchildren  Mike Pence-2005 #ImpeachTrump pic.twitter.com/SxmT8NGEA7  Scott Dworkin (@funder) August 29, 2017At the time, Pence was leading an effort by House Republicans to offset any post-Katrina aid with offsetting budget cuts in other programs, which includes highway projects and the new Medicare prescription drug benefit.Mike, you can stop calling yourself  pro-life  now, thankyouverymuch.Featured image via Aaron P.

7075," Sarah Palin’s Idiocy Strikes Again, Urges Us To Start ‘Condoning Racism’ (IMAGE)","In what some may assume is a misspeak and others may attribute to a Freudian slip, Sarah Palin took to Facebook to go after rapper Azealia Banks. To be honest, the two of these ladies fighting is a mind-numbing assault on everything good and decent, because both women are outrageous in their own regards. The two have been trapped in a Twitter battle that s gotten kind of ugly.Trying to end the battle, in her own condescending way, was Palin when she took to her medium of choice, Facebook. She wrote: Hey Female Rapper   listen up, little darling. No one has any idea what you re wigging out about in these bizarre, violent rants against me, but you re obviously not exercising enough intelligence to acknowledge you ve been sucked into believing some fake interview in which I supposedly offered comments representing the antithesis of my truth.In this life, you re blessed to have been given an influential platform. So have I. Why don t we strengthen both our platforms and work together on something worthwhile   like condoning racism, along with empowering young women to defend themselves against a most misogynist, degrading, devastating assault perpetrated by evil men   rape.Thanks.

22025,Five Things You Need to Know About CrowdStrike,". The Daily CallerThe Democratic Party and mainstream media have become increasingly consumed with the narrative that Donald Trump s election win is largely influenced by Russian hacking.The narrative is centered around two hacks the hack of a DNC server that led to the release of embarrassing emails during the Democratic National Convention, and the hack of John Podesta s email which led to several embarrassing moments for the Clinton campaign in October 2016. Both are supposedly the result of the Russians.The Russia story is back in the headlines once again after reports surrounding former President Barack Obama s attempts to  punish  Russia for its interference.However, there is still a cloud of doubt hanging over the DNC s Russia narrative on the breach of the DNC servers.The analysis that alleged that Russia was behind the DNC server breach was carried out not by the U.S. government, but by the private security group CrowdStrike.CrowdStrike is the sole source of this claim, with their June 2016 report,  Bears in the Midst: Intrusion into the Democratic National Committee  being the basis of the DNC s Russian hacking allegations.Here are five key points about CrowdStrike that the mainstream media is ignoring:1. Obama Appoints CrowdStrike Officer To Admin Post Two Months Before June 2016 Report On Russia Hacking DNC2. The FBI Never Looked At The DNC s Servers   Only CrowdStrike Did3. Comey Contradicted The DNC s Story On The FBI Asking To See The Server4. CrowdStrike Co-Founder Is Fellow On Russia Hawk Group, Has Connections To George Soros, Ukrainian Billionaire5.

4975, #NeverTrump GOP Rep.: ‘Not One Character Trait In Trump I’d Want My Son To Emulate’,"There has been a lot of talk about Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump s character and temperament when it comes to his being fit to serve as president. There is good reason for this, considering the unending litany of offensive things he s said and done over the last year or so during his travesty of a presidential campaign. He has accused former rival Ted Cruz s father of being in on the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, mocked a disabled reporter, accused Fox host and debate moderator Megyn Kelly of being menstrual when she challenged his derogatory comments about women, picked a fight with a Muslim military family who lost a son in the Iraq war the list literally is too long to even scratch the surface of the appalling and horrific statements here.Well, people in Trump s own party are unhappy with their standard-bearer on a pretty big level, and many are refusing to support him. Some, including a former Romney 2012 official, are even supporting Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton just to keep Trump out of office. That is how bad it is.There s now one more Republican to add to that list: Rep. Scott Rigell (R-VA). Rigell is no moderate, either. He gained his congressional seat as a Tea Partier, so he s as right wing as they come and then some. However, he simply cannot stomach Trump.

7576, ‘Dilbert’ Creator Scott Adams Says Comparing Trump To Hitler Is Racist,"The man behind the lovably hapless office drone  Dilbert  has a few things to say about Donald Trump   and they are a doozy.In a post on his blog, cartoonist Scott Adams blasted people who dared to compare Donald Trump to German dictator Adolf Hitler, describing the comparison as  racist  against German people.Can we agree that calling the candidate with German ancestry Hitler  is racist? It sure feels that way to me. I m about half German, same as Trump. And it feels like a racial insult to me.I m not easily offended, but I don t see any other way to interpret the incessant Hitler analogies directed at Trump. If he were female and Asian   with exactly the same policies   would we be comparing him to Hitler every five seconds?I don t think so.There are, of course, a few things wrong with Adams  analysis:  German  isn t a race, Hitler wasn t German, comparing one person with German ancestry to an infamous tyrant isn t  racist , the list goes on..But more to the point, Donald Trump wouldn t be an Asian female, because Donald Trump s policies   at their core   appeal to white supremacists who would never consider voting for a woman of color. The kind of hate-fueled rhetoric that makes Trump soar in the Republican polls is at the expense of minorities, women, and other disadvantaged groups. You know who else used prejudice and scapegoating to fire up his supporters? Adams sure can t think of anyone!However, Adams believes that Trump is actually the anti-Hitler, because   and this is pretty astounding   Trump is actually  pro-minority.  But only the  minorities  Adams considers worthy:What Adams doesn t mention are actual minorities, including Hispanics that Trump described as  rapists  or African Americans, who have been repeatedly violently attacked at his rallies. The minorities Adams counts are mostly just aggrieved white people who want things their way and are upset that President Obama won t give it to them.What about the Muslims Trump suggested should be banned? Adams agrees that s discrimination, but says they deserve it.Trump has indeed suggested discrimination against incoming Muslims. But I think you have to see this situation as a special case because Sharia law is incompatible with the Constitution of the United States. And conquering infidels is part of the Islamic belief system in some corners of Islam. If we can t tell the good people from the bad, it boils down to national security and risk-management.Hilariously, Adams concludes by begging his readers to instead try to compare Hitler to people like  Nelson Mandela, Mother Teresa, and Gandhi.  He claims it s  easier than you want to believe.  He doesn t explain how.Despite all of this lunacy, Adams says he isn t endorsing Trump for president, but only because the Republican front-runner  scares  people too much to effectively bring the country together. However, he is optimistic that Trump could  persuade  people not to be afraid of him using his  deal-making  skills. If that happens, Adams seems to think Trump would be an awesome president. Just ask all those  minorities  he mentioned.Featured image via ibmphoto24/Flickr ",News,"March 10, 2016"

While the economy is indeed getting better for some, for others who have been unemployed long-term, they are increasingly being left behind.

DHS estimates more than 100,000 spouses will be eligible to apply when it begins accepting applications May 26.The complaint, filed by the Immigration Reform Law Institute on behalf of the displaced workers, alleges DHS does not have the authority to make the rule, and that the rule violates federal labor protection law. IRLI is asking the judge to halt implementation of the rule until the case is heard. The larger implication is that Obama is arguing he has the executive authority to allow anyone to work in the United States,  John Miano, the attorney for the displaced workers, told The Daily Caller News Foundation.  [He] started with the children, then the parents, and now the spouses of H-1B workers. An update to the federal register indicates the Obama administration is also looking at expansions to other visa programs, he said.  If the president can let illegal aliens work, he can let anyone work and he s doing it. The workers are former employees of tech giant Southern California Edison, which was recently investigated for firing hundreds of American workers after forcing them to train their foreign replacements. (RELATED: Senators Ask Feds to Investigate Guest Worker Visa Abuse)The biggest challenge will be convincing a judge the workers he represents have legal standing to bring the case, Miano told TheDCNF.He ll argue the rule is relevant to the displaced workers because it will result in more competition in their job market. The government will counter that the workers can t prove the rule will affect their future job prospects.If the judge agrees to hear the case, Miano will then make the case that DHS overstepped the bounds of its authority and that the rule violates labor protection law. The law states that foreign work permits cannot adversely affect American wages, but all we ve seen during this administration is standards of living fall and outsized corporate profits continue to rise,  IRLI Executive Director Dale Wilcox said in a statement.

The owners didn t hire Goodell to be their social justice director Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones led a conference call with 17 NFL owners on Thursday to discuss the possibility of halting commissioner Roger Goodell s pending contract extension.The owners on Thursday s conference call are unhappy with Goodell and the NFL s front office for a variety of reasons, including the player protests staged during the national anthem, issues regarding the relocation of teams to Los Angeles and the league s handling of the Ray Rice domestic violence case, sources told ESPN. You don t get to have this many messes over the years like Roger has had and survive it,  one owner said during the call.Sources have previously said that Jones has tried to stand in the way of any extension for Goodell.Last month, ESPN reported that Jones was impeding the progress of contract negotiations aimed at an extension for Goodell.  If not for Jerry,  one owner said last month in regard to the contract negotiations,  this deal would be done. The tension between Jones and Goodell is in part credited to the commissioner giving Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott a six-game suspension, which is currently being disputed in court.Another factor in the frustration with Goodell is the controversy surrounding players kneeling during the national anthem.Goodell won t mandate the players stand while Jones is threatening Cowboys onto their feet.Earlier this month, Jones said that any of his players who  disrespect  the flag won t be allowed to play. I know this, we cannot in the NFL in any way give the implication that we tolerate disrespecting the flag,  Jones, also the team s general manager, said after a 35-31 loss to the Green Bay Packers on October 8.The previous week, Jones knelt along with head coach Jason Garrett and all their players in the middle of the field on September 26 in a show of unity before they all stood for the anthem before their 28-17 win over the Arizona Cardinals.

364, GOP Implodes As California Passes Bill To Make Congress Censure Trump’s Racism (DETAILS),"About a month ago, Donald Trump shocked the country by responding to a violent white nationalist rally in Charlottesville in a way that was completely vile. Defending white supremacists and stating that  both sides  were responsible for the violence, Americans across the country were horrified that such a racist message could come from the President of the United States. And now, some areas of the country are standing up to it.California is now sending a strong message to Trump and his administration in response to the horrific endorsements Trump has given to white supremacists. The lower house of the California legislature has just passed a resolution that is demanding that Congress censure Trump so that the undeserving POTUS is clear that We will no longer tolerate his behavior. Assembly member Tony Thurmond said: The leader of the free world can t continue to use language that legitimizes the actions of extremists groups that promote hate. Congress must exercise its power to check the president by voting for his immediate censure. While a GOP-dominant Congress likely won t censure Trump, this initiative marks the first attempt to censure a sitting President since 1834   and that should send a strong message. The Hill also reports that California is trying to get other states to join them in similar ways, demanding that Trump should  publicly apologize to all Americans for his racist and bigoted behavior. This bill follows Trump s own resolution in which he tried to condemn the attacks in Charlottesville. However, he continues to fall short with his weak statements. Refusing to denounce the specific hate groups that are responsible, Trump instead spoke against racism in all forms.  Here s Trump s weak, spineless statement: We condemn the recent violence in Charlottesville and oppose hatred, bigotry, and racism in all forms. Hours before, Trump had doubled down on his horrendous  both sides  comment, stating that counterprotesters were also to blame: You have some pretty bad dudes on the other side also. When you look at really what s happened since Charlottesville, a lot of people are saying and people have actually written,  Gee Trump may have a point. That is seriously disgusting.

819, Watch A GOP Member Of Science Committee Suffer Total Humiliation At Hand Of NASA Scientist,"It s no secret that Republicans seem to think that the movie Idiocracy is a documentary. They refuse to believe the scientific consensus that climate change is manmade and a big f*cking deal. Republicans actually think that higher education is bad and well, the rise in  flat earthers,  can t be a coincidence.Is it any surprise, then, that the Republican-led House Committee on Science, Space and Technology doesn t have a single scientist? That s not even the worst of it. They have as a ranking member Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-California), whose greatest hits include blaming prehistorical climate change on dinosaur farts.During a panel with real scientists, as opposed to those who play scientist in Congress, Rohrabacher even topped the dinosaur theory. In a discussion about Mars, in which a NASA scientist said there might have been life on Mars many, many years ago, Rohrabacher just had to ask: You have indicated that Mars   was totally different thousands of years ago. Is it possible that there was a civilization on Mars thousands of years ago? Source: SlateYeah, just a couple of things here. The NASA scientist was talking about microbial life, not anything resembling human life and we re talking billions of years, not thousands of years ago. Then again, it seems that most Christian Republicans think the earth is just 6,000 years old, so it s doubtful Rohrabacher can think in such vast terms.Kenneth Farley, who worked on the 2020 rover and Europa Clipper, and is a professor of geochemistry at the California Institute of Technology, somehow didn t lose his patience with Rohrabacher, and simply said: So, the evidence is that Mars was different billions of years ago   not thousands of years ago,  Farley said.  There is no evidence that I am aware of. Rohrabacher, presumably refusing to take  no  for an answer, asked,  would you rule that out? Harley said,  that is extremely unlikely.

Largely missing from news media coverage is that the same news-making scientific report warned the ongoing violence in Syria has  created a setting in which we have seen the re-emergence of polio and measles, as well as tuberculosis, hepatitis A, and other infections in Syria and among displaced Syrian refugees. Indeed, in 2013 the World Health Organization documented new cases of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, reporting that year alone the number of confirmed measles cases in Syria reached 139, as compared to no documented cases in 2010 and 2011.The WHO reported that 2013 saw Syria s first outbreak of polio since 1999. According to an April 2015 WHO report, 35 children were subsequently paralysed by polio before the start of a new vaccine campaign.In November, 2014 PLOS documented the spread of measles from among the Syrian refugee population.Regarding the flesh-eating disease, leishmaniasis, PLOP warned in its latest report,  We may be witnessing an epidemic of historic and unprecedented proportions, but it has largely been hidden due to lack of specific information. The PLOP journal reported leishmaniasis is now affecting hundreds of thousands of refugees and has spread to Iraq, Lebanon, Jordan, Libya and Yemen. In Yemen alone, 10,000 new cases have been reported annually, the journal reported. Additionally, the number of cases of CL (cutaneous leishmaniasis) has most likely been severely underreported  due in part to constraints on collecting data from violence-torn regions, PLOP warned. Few countries have mandated reporting of CL and the resultant weak reporting system promotes a lack of disease awareness and public policies for treatment and prevention,  the report added. Due to the violence, Syrians have been forced to flee from their homes and seek refuge across the Middle East, North Africa, and, more recently, Europe,  the journal documented.Volcano-like ulcersLeishmaniasis, meanwhile, is a disease caused by protozoan parasites. It is spread almost entirely by sandflies, including those present in the U.S.There are three main types of the disease: cutaneous, mucocutaneous, and visceral leishmaniasis.Cutaneous is the most common form among Syrians. It manifests in skin sores that typically develop within a few weeks or months from a sand fly bite. The sores can initially appear as bumps or nodules and may evolve into volcano-like ulcers.Mucocutaneous leishmaniasis causes skin ulcers like the cutaneous form, as well as mucosal ulcers that usually damage the nose and mouth.Visceral leishmaniasis, which has also been found among Syrian refugees, is the most serious form and can be fatal. It damages internal organs, usually the spleen and liver, and also affects bone marrow.Threat to U.S.?Refugees who enter the U.S. must undergo medical screening according to protocols established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC. Each refugee must submit to a physical examination, including a skin test and possibly a chest x-ray to check for tuberculosis,as well as a blood test for syphilis.The blood tests do not currently look for leishmaniasis. Clearly, an attending doctor could easily spot a patient with obvious skin ulcers. However, leishmaniasis cannot be detected upon physical examination if the patient is asymptomatic, as can be the case for years.In December, Dr. Heather Burke, an epidemiologist from the CDC s Immigrant, Refugee, and Migrant Health Branch, explained to Breitbart Jerusalem that there is generally a window of three to six months from the initial physical examination until a refugee departs for the U.S.She said a medical examination is valid for six months, and explained that patients undergo a second examination just prior to departure   a quicker  fitness to fly  screening. While she conceded that this final examination is not thorough, she said it would pick up any visible skin lesions. Burke told Breitbart Jerusalem that she is not aware of a single case of leishmaniasis entering the U.S. via Syrian refugees.Dr. Jane Orient, executive director of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, warned that  most doctors in the U.S. know nothing about leishmaniasis. We d all need to refer patients to tropical diseases specialists,  she told Breitbart Jerusalem in December.  The treatments are toxic and expensive, and some are not widely available. For Orient, the only sensible public health policy is  for all refugees to pass through a quarantined place like Ellis Island. Officials need to know where they ve been and what diseases occur there. We need sophisticated, reliable screening methods and excellent vector control in any areas where refugees stay. For entire story: Breitbart News",left-news,"Jun 1, 2016"
5074, WATCH: Trump Supporter Claims Confederate Flag Is Not Racist And Civil War Wasn’t About Slavery,"It s truly sad that southern conservatives don t even know their own history.During a Donald Trump rally in Florida a group displayed a Confederate flag at the venue and were quickly told it had to be removed. The flag had a  Trump 2016  message on it.When asked by CNN why he displayed it, Brandon Partin explained that he bought the flag because they were being sold outside the rally and he thought Donald Trump would approve of it being flown at the rally.And then Partin defended the flag as  not racist  and suggested the Civil War was not fought because of racism and slavery. Most people in our country don t understand the full history behind the flag. So, I understand that the media and a lot of other people are going to turn it into something that it s not, you know, say that it s a racist thing or, you know, white supremacist. I am not a white supremacist. And it was about the North and the South. It wasn t about racism at all. The North had African-Americans fighting for them and the South had them for them, too. So for people who spin it in that direction is just completely false. I think that on a personal level between my beliefs and Trump s beliefs, I don t think he would have a problem with it at all because he probably understands the history and that s why we re all here. Here s the video via YouTube:First of all, the idea that slaves willingly fought for the Confederacy is ludicrous. The slave-holding Confederates feared giving firearms to slaves. Plus, slaves would have been forced to fight because they would not have freely fought for their own continued enslavement. Also, the Confederacy only approved of forcing blacks to fight for them on March 13, 1865 in an act of desperation. Lee surrendered on April 9, 1865. Partin is right that a very small percentage of black people in the South were soldiers in the Confederacy, but that s only because they were pressed into service by their tyrant masters and didn t want to be slaughtered for disobeying.Furthermore, the Civil War and the Confederate flag was all about slavery and racism. As evidence, in their Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal Union, South Carolinians prominently cited slavery as the major cause of the decision to leave the Union and begin the process of seizing control of forts and other United States government property.A geographical line has been drawn across the Union, and all the States north of that line have united in the election of a man to the high office of President of the United States, whose opinions and purposes are hostile to slavery. He is to be entrusted with the administration of the common Government, because he has declared that that  Government cannot endure permanently half slave, half free,  and that the public mind must rest in the belief that slavery is in the course of ultimate extinction.This sectional combination for the submersion of the Constitution, has been aided in some of the States by elevating to citizenship, persons who, by the supreme law of the land, are incapable of becoming citizens; and their votes have been used to inaugurate a new policy, hostile to the South, and destructive of its beliefs and safety.In addition, Confederate Vice-President Alexander Stephens made it clear in his  Cornerstone Speech  that the Confederate government was founded on the belief that black people are an inferior race and that slavery is the cornerstone of the South. Our new Government is founded upon exactly the opposite ideas; its foundations are laid, its cornerstone rests, upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and normal condition. In short, the Confederate flag waving morons are trying to re-write history to make the Confederacy look like it was this great paradise that the  evil  Union unjustly fought a war against in 1861-1865. The war of Northern aggression  some conservatives call it. Except that the South fired the first shots at Fort Sumter in an effort to forcibly seize US Government property.It s time for conservatives to face facts. The Confederate flag is racist. The Civil War was fought over slavery. And the Confederates were a bunch of traitors whose descendants are still whining about a war they lost and are now supporting Trump because they believe he ll help them revive the  cause,  which again is all about subjugation, hatred, and oppression of people who don t have white skin.Featured Image: Screenshot ",News,"August 13, 2016"

14671,GA TOWN MANDATES GUN OWNERSHIP: Here’s What Happened To The Crime Rate…,"The results of this town s gun ownership mandate shows what happens when there are armed civilians out there In 1982, the little town of Kennesaw, Georgia passed an ordinance that every able bodied family must own a gun. Here is the text of the ordinance:(a) In order to provide for the emergency management of the city, and further in order to provide for and protect the safety, security and general welfare of the city and its inhabitants, every head of household residing in the city limits is required to maintain a firearm, together with ammunition therefore.(b)Exempt from the effect of this section are those heads of households who suffer a physical or mental disability which would prohibit them from using such a firearm. Further exempt from the effect of this section are those heads of households who are paupers or who conscientiously oppose maintaining firearms as a result of beliefs or religious doctrine, or persons convicted of a felony.An amendment to the gun ownership law grants exceptions to convicted felons, conscientious objectors and those who cannot afford a gun.In 2007, there was a follow up, showing the effects of the law on crime and the city. The liberals of course warned that Kennesaw would become the Wild West. Like all liberal predictions, this one belongs in the sewer. (Make sure you flush twice, it s a long ways to DNC HQ) In the 25 years that the law had been in place as of 2007 not one murder or defensive shooting took place. The first murder finally did occur in 2014, 32 years into the ordinance. The population soared from 5,242 to 28,189. The year prior to the passage of the ordinance, the city had a crime rate of (4,332 per 100,000). That was higher than the national average of (3,899 per 100,000). As of 2007, the crime rate had dropped to (2,268 per 100,000). The current crime rate for Kennesaw has dropped to (1,760 Per 100,000)In fact, Family Circle Magazine ranked Kennesaw as one of the ten best cities for families to live in. Kennesaw came in at Number 5. Kennesaw is far from being the one exception to the rule.The DOJ released a report that covered the years 1993 to 2011, a period in which gun ownership soared. What did they find? In 1993 there were 18,253 gun deaths. In 2011 there were just 11,101. Even more startling is that non fatal shootings dropped by 69%!!What about the liberal propaganda that gun shows are the case of most gun shootings because there are no background checks? The DOJ found that gun felons in federal prisons got just 2% of their guns from gun shows. 10 percent said they purchased their gun from a retail shop or pawnshop, 37 percent obtained it from family or friends, and another 40 percent obtained it from an illegal source.Concealed carriers also assisted in dropping crime rates during the years of the Obama caliphate. The number of concealed carry permits in 2007 was 4.6 million and has now soared to 12.8 million. That number is actually much higher since 8 states now do not require a concealed carry permit. During this same period, gun deaths dropped from 5.6 million to 4.2 million per 100,000.Harvard studied gun policies around the world and found to their astonishment that more guns mean less crime.One last item. What about the vaunted Gun free Zones? Are they working? Yes, but only for mass murderers. Since the 1950s, all but two mass shootings took place in gun free zones.Via: The PC Graveyard",politics,"Jan 11, 2016"

He claims that that town will now be taken over by jihadists, and that the air strike on the air base only cleared the way from them to move in and take over.Watson also questions why Assad would have used chemicals to attack his own people when it would be completely self-defeating?  Less than one week ago, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said a regime change in Syria was  off the table . Now Tillerson is saying regime change is back on the table. Why would Assad put himself in this position he asks? Watson believes there is a real chance that Trump has been surrounded and manipulated by neocons in the  deep state .",politics,"Apr 8, 2017"

19206,BREAKING: IRAN Tests Cruise Missile…Trump WARNS…They’re “Playing with fire…They don’t appreciate how ‘kind’ President Obama was to them. Not Me!” [VIDEO],"Peace through strength President Donald Trump raised the stakes with Iran again this morning by dashing off a tweet.The tweet comes a day after the new president dramatically raised the possibility of military action against Iran over its missiles test on Thursday saying  nothing is off the table  amid news that a new round of sanctions could be coming within hours. Sources told the Associated Press that up to two dozen Iranian individuals, companies and possibly government agencies could be penalized as part of the move.Action could come as early as later Friday, said the officials and others with knowledge of the decision. The individuals weren t authorized to discuss the unannounced sanctions publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.Gen. Michael Flynn told reporters during a White House press briefing that the administration  condemns such actions by Iran that undermine security, prosperity and stability throughout and beyond the Middle East that puts American lives at risk.   As of today, we are officially putting Iran on notice,  he said.Trump used the phrase when asked directly if military action was possible, and after a series of angry tweets about how the Islamic republic tested a ballistic missile   something the nuclear bargain it struck with Barack Obama explicitly forbids. It also emerged Thursday that Iran has tested a cruise missile called  Sumar  that is capable of carrying nuclear weapons. The development was reported by German newspaper Die Welt reported Thursday, citing unspecified intelligence sources.Trump s personal involvement began earl on Thursday morning when he used social media to issue an explicit warning to Tehran.Trump has been openly hostile to the terms of the Obama-Tehran nuclear deal, saying during his presidential campaign that it was  stupid,   a disgrace,  and  the worst deal ever negotiated.  His tweets likely stand as the first time a head of state has used social media to threaten a foreign country. They were met with contempt by the Iranian regime.A top adviser to the Iranian supreme leader said the country will not yield to  useless  US threats from  an inexperienced person  over its ballistic missile program.Ali Akbar Velayati said, who is a senior counsel to Iran s most powerful man Ayatollah Ali Khamenei hit back. This is not the first time that an inexperienced person has threatened Iran,  he said. The American government will understand that threatening Iran is useless. The report of a cruise missile test in the German newspaper said the Sumar cruise missile was built in Iran and traveled around 375 miles in its first known successful test.The missile is believed to be capable of carrying nuclear weapons and may have a range of 1,200 to 1,800 miles, the paper said, citing intelligence sources.Cruise missiles are harder to counter than ballistic missiles since they fly at lower altitudes and can evade enemy radar, confounding missile defense missiles and hitting targets deep inside an opponent s territory.But the biggest advantage from Iran s point of view, a security expert told Die Welt, was that cruise missiles are not mentioned in any United Nations resolutions that ban work on ballistic missiles capable of carrying nuclear weapons.There has been no explicit response from Iran or from Washington on the cruise missile disclosure.However, Trump s National Security Advisor had issued his own stern warning to Tehran s mullahs on Wednesday.

1038," Trump’s Latest Appointee Is A Climate Denier, A Racist, A Birther, A Homophobe, And An Islamophobe","There are people currently being turned down for jobs at Applebee s with better resumes than William Bradford. The obscure attorney general of the Chiricahua Apache Nation was recently catapulted to a job in the federal government when Trump announced he was appointing Bradford to run the Energy Department s Office of Indian Energy. Like many of Trump s hires, Bradford has almost zero in the way of experience at the job he was just hired for. His only tweets relating to energy are those that call climate scientists  cultists. If he wasn t hired for his experience, he certainly wasn t hired for the content of his character, either. Bradford has forceful opinions on nearly every person, race, ethnicity, and lifestyle under the sun   and all of them are bigoted.On his now deleted Twitter and Facebook accounts, Bradford documented his bigotry like a man checking boxes on the list of qualities the biggest asshole in the world might have: He is himself Jewish, but it didn t stop him from once calling Mark Zuckerberg a  self-hating Jew  for the  crime  of writing an essay opposing Trump, adding that he hoped Zuckerberg  gets what he deserves. He pushed birther conspiracies about Obama, while also promoting an even more obscure right-wing conspiracy that suggested Obama is secretly gay.As the above tweet suggests, Bradford is also big on bashing Muslims. A major obsession of his was to float theories that Obama was coordinating with Muslims in Iran to destroy America.Bradford also called Japanese internment camps in World War II  necessary,  parroting Trump s on-again, off-again relationship with creating internment camps for Muslims.For simplicity, let s go over the list. Bradford is:And now he s working, as the Washington Post put it, to help  Native Americans and Alaska Native tribes and villages obtain electricity and reduce energy costs  a job he has no experience in and no apparent desire to do. The position is final because it s a job that does not require congressional approval.In no uncertain terms, William Bradford would be unemployable in any other administration. His legacy of toxic, violent and unbalanced comments on social media would be enough to send up all kinds of alarm bells for any White House that cared, even slightly, about staffing government roles with people who could actually perform with competently. Instead, Trump is stuffing positions seemingly at a whim. He has taken to hiring the wives of his political critics to curry favor (and watching Newt Gingrich and Mitch McConnell, both of whom have spouses owing their careers to Trump, bend to his will shows how effective this has been). He has no problem hiring people who plagiarized or lied about their education. And he has no issues with a person s mental stability either.The result is nothing short of a disaster.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"June 23, 2017"
4687, Trump Adviser Just Proved Hillary’s ‘Basket Of Deplorables’ Comment Correct With One Image,"For some reason, the Trump campaign is utterly clueless about the alt-right movement and what it stands for. Trump himself regularly retweets stuff from those deplorable (oops, we said it) excuses for human beings and then brushes it off, if he even says anything at all. He even enthusiastically tweeted an image of himself as Pepe the Frog, a mascot for the Neo-Nazis, which is bad enough given that Trump keeps saying he ll work for all Americans.One of his top advisers, Roger Stone, now, is saying he s proud to walk alongside Trump as a symbol for the Neo-Nazi movement while he s protesting Hillary s  basket of deplorables  comment aimed at half of Trump s followers.The irony is strong in this one.Stone thinks he s going to turn the word  deplorables  around the way that President Obama turned  Obamacare  from something derogatory into something with his signature on it. He will make this backfire on Hillary, because of course. It s his own idea that s backfiring though   all he s done is prove that an awful lot of Trump s supporters are really deplorable people.Image via TwitterPepe the Frog has been around for awhile, to be sure. It recently became unacceptable, however, as the Neo-Nazis began working towards claiming Pepe as a racist, white nationalist symbol.So now Pepe represents what he was always supposed to represent, and he s in a likeness of Donald Trump. Roger Stone has an image co-opted from  The Expendables,  showing Trump as a Neo-Nazi mascot, that he s put on social media.And he s probably amazingly proud of his ingenious idea.This isn t the first time Trump s been depicted as Pepe. In 2015, Trump retweeted a different image of himself as Pepe standing in front of an American flag, and behind a podium. The alt-right worked to associate their mascot with Trump because they believe that Trump represents them. And who wouldn t?

White nationalists, who make up an awful lot of the alt-right, are far more hateful and discriminating than Hillary ever could be.The truth is that these are people who think that immigration equals white genocide. Some on the alt-right hate women and everything to do with women. A lot of them think that some races are inherently more stupid than others, and deserve to be treated as such. These are people who are as anti-Semitic as Adolf Hitler.In short, they re deplorable people, and Stone is busy complaining that Hillary called them what they are while directly associating Trump with them. Any reasonable campaign and any reasonable adviser would find a different way to make that backfire on Hillary   the Trump camp is too entrenched with the alt-right and too full of itself to realize what they ve actually done, though.Featured image via screen capture from Roger Stone s tweet",News,"September 10, 2016"

8693, The GOP Is Sharing Conference Space With PERFECT Metaphor For Republican Party (VIDEO),"There are seldom those moments in life that seem so poetic, but the people sharing the space where the Republican congressional retreat is being held is pretty much the perfect metaphor for the embodiment of the GOP party platform.It s all happening at the Marriott Hotel at the Baltimore Harbor, and right down the hall from where Republicans are trying to put together strategies for the coming year   that is where the Mid-Atlantic Monument Builders  Association is holding their annual summit. And within the room where the Monument Builders are meeting, there is a huge sampling of headstones.How is this the perfect metaphor for the Republican party? So glad you asked.The GOP has spent nearly the past thirty years trying to make sure people have a rougher go at life than they could if they had a government that actually worked in their best interest. Instead of fighting for people to have greater access to health care, they ve been mercilessly fighting against broadened access and affordable coverage. They ve also been trying for decades to privatize social security instead of strengthen our existing government pension program that guarantees income for senior citizens who worked hard all their lives. They d prefer a system that relied on an unsteady market where people could, quite literally, lose everything. The GOP has also consistently tried to make it harder for low-income citizens to have access to Medicaid and food assistance programs. Not to mention the GOP s love for war and lust for sending American lives to die for causes still unknown.So, to see gravestones just steps away from where congressional Republicans are talking about ideas is absolutely perfect. Their ideas and plans for the people of this nation would lead to the early demise of several citizens. Kudos to whoever chose that space to hold the event, it s very telling of GOP policy.

Another Trump voter, Scott McCommons, said that he was  disappointed  with Trump s first 100 days, calling it was a  disaster. He s got enough time to get on Twitter, and rant and rave, and on top of that lie on Twitter,  he said.

I expected him to work a little harder [on health care],  he continued.  Be a little more reasonable instead of threatening people. That s unpresidential. I voted to send him to Washington strictly because I thought he would make change, nobody would push him around.

Hummmm The city of Baltimore received over $1.8 billion from President Barack Obama s stimulus law, including $467.1 million to invest in education and $26.5 million for crime prevention.President Obama claimed last Tuesday that if the Republican-controlled Congress would implement his policies to make  massive investments in urban communities,  they could  make a difference right now  in the city, currently in upheaval following the death of Freddie Gray.However, a Washington Free Beacon analysis found that the Obama administration and Democratically-controlled Congress did make a  massive  investment into Baltimore, appropriating $1,831,768,487 though the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), commonly known as the stimulus.According to Recovery.gov, one of Baltimore s central ZIP codes, 21201, received the most stimulus funding in the city, a total of $837,955,866. The amount included funding for 276 awards, and the website reports that the spending had created 290 jobs in the fourth quarter in 2013.Of this amount, $467.1 million went to education; $206.1 million to the environment; $24 million to  family ; $16.1 million to infrastructure; $15.2 million to transportation; $11.9 million to housing; and $3.1 million to job training.ZIP code 21202 received $425,170,937, including a $136 million grant to  improve teaching and learning for students most at risk of failing to meet State academic achievement standards. Twenty-nine other ZIP codes listed in Baltimore city received a total of $568,641,684.The Free Beacon calculated the total amount of stimulus funds disbursed to all ZIP codes in Baltimore City, as reported on the stimulus website Recovery.gov. The analysis includes the totals of awards to prime recipients in Baltimore, plus sub-recipient awards to Baltimore organizations and companies that conducted stimulus projects located outside the city.The projects included $26.5 million from the Justice Department (DOJ) to combat gang activity and provide community support for at-risk juveniles. The State of MD Governor s Office of Crime Control & Prevention (GOCCP) goals and objectives of this project are to create and retain jobs to bolster Maryland s faltering economy, and make resources available to law enforcement and other public safety agencies to help protect Maryland citizens,  the project s description states.Read more: WFB",politics,"May 4, 2015"
6804, Did Donald Trump Jr. Just Say His Dad Beat Him For Refusing To Get Him Coke? (VIDEO),"It s hard to imagine Donald Trump showing anything approaching respect to his kids. From openly fantasizing about his infant daughter s future breasts, to posing for creepy photos with Ivanka, to pretty much flat-out saying he wants to f*ck Ivanka, it s clear that The Donald probably isn t that great of a father. Watching him speak at his rallies or on television easily gives one the impression that Trump is a boiling pot of rage ready to spill over on whomever is nearby at the time. But in an interview on Fox News, Donald Trump Jr. implied that the aforementioned  boiling  took physical form, and that he was the closest in proximity to his father when it happened at least once. You told me a story once, you told me on your radio show, your dad   you re 7 or 8 years old and he asks you to get him a coke can and you didn t get it?  host Sean Hannity asked. Trump Jr. explained: He came back from a rather rough day at work and he was like  Run to the kitchen and get me a coke.  I said  I m not your EXPLETIVE maid, and I ve never seen the man move so fast in my life. Apparently, Trump Jr. ran from his father, but his mother stopped him at the top of the stairs. He says his mom, who is the  European tough disciplinarian type,  handed him to Trump for punishment. I learned never to do that one again,  Trump Jr. said with a grin on his face. He did not say what form his punishment took, but it certainly was not pretty. Most parents don t chase their kids around the house over simple backtalk. Most children are not so terrified of what would happen as a punishment that they flee in terror.Did he beat his son for refusing to grab him a coke? We ll never know until he clarifies   but The Donald is certainly a violent man. Before he ran for President, ex-wife Ivana Trump said during divorce proceedings that he would rape and humiliate her, once assaulting her after a failed surgery to remove a bald spot. The Daily Beast gives a rundown of the horrific incident:What followed was a  violent assault,  according to Lost Tycoon. Donald held back Ivana s arms and began to pull out fistfuls of hair from her scalp, as if to mirror the pain he felt from his own operation. He tore off her clothes and unzipped his pants. Then he jams his penis inside her for the first time in more than sixteen months. Ivana is terrified  It is a violent assault,  Hurt writes.  According to versions she repeats to some of her closest confidantes,  he raped me. Then he jams his penis inside her for the first time in more than sixteen months. Ivana is terrified  It is a violent assault,  Hurt writes.  According to versions she repeats to some of her closest confidantes,  he raped me.

2943, Trump Spokesman Reveals ASTONISHINGLY Racist Reason Kanye West Wasn’t Invited To Inauguration,"Even after famously meeting with Donald Trump last month, and even after Trump has had an historically difficult time finding A-list musicians willing to debase themselves enough to perform at his inauguration, the planning committee said no to Kanye West as its star or anything else, and the reason is incredibly racist. He s not  traditionally American  enough. What in heaven s name could that mean, hmmmm?A spokesperson for president-elect Donald Trump s inauguration committee told CNN that Friend of Donald Kanye West was not invited to perform at the real estate mogul s inaugural because  Ye s music wasn t right for the  typically and traditionally American event.  Tom Barrack, chairman of the Presidential Inauguration Committee, told CNN s Erin Burnett that the inauguration wasn t a  fitting  venue for West, who famously met with Trump in December and posed for a stiff photo at Trump Tower afterwards and whose music is about to be the subject of a course at Washington University in St. Louis called  Politics of Kanye West: Black Genius and Sonic Aesthetics. He s been great, he considers himself a friend of the president-elect, but it s not the venue.  Kanye, who was born in Chicago and performs a style of music, hip-hop, that was invented in the United States on the streets of Trump s New York in the late 1970s, performed at MTV s Inaugural Youth Ball in honor of President Obama in 2009.  It s going to be typically and traditionally American, and Kanye is a great guy, we just haven t asked him to perform. And we move on with our agenda,  Barrack added.Source: BillboardHere s the video:Damn @kanyewest couldn t even get to perform at this friend @realDonaldTrump s inauguration b/c the event is  Traditionally American . pic.twitter.com/wu3EezncR2  Unstripped Voice (@UnstrippedVoice) January 18, 2017Looking over the list of inaugural entertainers, it s clear that  typically and traditionally American  means white, with a few exceptions. Most are country artists. There are a couple of African-American R&B singers, there s Travis Green, and there s an Indian-American DJ named RaviDrums. To give that extra-American oomph, Trump s ball will feature Irish dance.Trump may have done West a favor. After expressing his theoretical support for Trump (he didn t actually vote, but if he had voted ), West was forced to cancel his tour.

After only 6 months as President Trump s White House Chief of Staff, Trump went around the media and announced on Twitter he was being replace with General John F. Kelly:I am pleased to inform you that I have just named General/Secretary John F Kelly as White House Chief of Staff. He is a Great American .  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 28, 2017 and a Great Leader. John has also done a spectacular job at Homeland Security. He has been a true star of my Administration  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 28, 2017Mr. Priebus, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, lost his job just hours after the president s signature drive to repeal his predecessor s health care program collapsed on the Senate floor and a day after an ugly feud with the new communications director erupted in a public airing of the deep animosities plaguing the White House.The announcement capped a fraught 24 hours in which the president s advisers waited for a change they had long anticipated. Mr. Priebus accompanied Mr. Trump on Air Force One for a day trip to Long Island as his fate was being decided. Making for a tense flight, his rival, Anthony Scaramucci, the communications director who had publicly vowed to force Mr. Priebus s resignation, was also on the plane and in the motorcade.Was Priebus the leaker? According to a report by Mediaite,  Fox s The Five host and friend to the president, Kimberly Guilfoyle told President Trump on Wednesday night he was Fox News host Kimberly Guilfoyle appears to have echoed Anthony Scaramucci s sentiments on Reince Priebus to President Donald Trump during a Wednesday night dinner at the White House, only without the profanity.The Five co-host was invited, along with her colleague Sean Hannity and former Fox News Executive Bill Shine, to the White House Wednesday night to dine with the president. And a report from The New York Times alleges that Guilfoyle told Trump that his Chief of Staff was  a problem  and  a leaker  during that dinner. According to an anonymous source who was briefed on their conversation, Guilfoyle also told the president that Priebus was  someone who was not serving his agenda. On Thursday night, Guilfoyle confirmed to her co-hosts on The Five that she did have dinner with the president. And while she refrained from going into detail about her conversations with Trump, she claimed that he was in a  very, very good mood  and was  enthused  about his agenda going forward.Guilfoyle didn t go after Priebus on-air, but she did say that  something needs to be done  regarding to the numerous White House shakeups.  MediaiteIn barely half a year on the job, Mr. Priebus never won the full confidence of the president nor was granted the authority to impose a working organizational structure on the West Wing. Always seeming to be on the edge of ouster, Mr. Priebus saw his fate finally sealed a week ago when Mr. Trump hired Mr. Scaramucci, an edgy Wall Street financier, over the chief of staff s objections. Mr. Priebus s ally, Sean Spicer, the press secretary, resigned in protest.  NYT",politics,"Jul 28, 2017"

What have I done? During the interview, Blunt also described Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA)15% as  pretty impressive. Tuesday, on Fox & Friends, co-host Anna Kooiman hit back hard at Blunt for those and other comments, saying,  You know what, then why don t you leave Hollywood, California, and let some American women take on the roles that you re getting? Because Americans are watching your movies and lining your pockets. Co-host Brian Kilmeade agreed, saying,  I agree with you. Longtime co-host Steve Doocy then compared Blunt s comments to those made by the country group the Dixie Chicks, who never rebounded after making critical, anti-war comments of President George W. Bush in 2003. You know what Emily Blunt just did? She just Dixie Chicked herself. She has alienated half the country, and now will think twice about going to one of her movies,  said Doocy.

1402, Saudi Arabia Will Do Something Truly Disgusting In An Attempt To Accommodate Trump (DETAILS),"This weekend, Donald Trump will visit Saudi Arabia   and the country is going out of its way to make him comfortable.Everyone knows that Donald Trump basically has the diet of an unhealthy toddler   he survives entirely on fast food and junk. It s previously been reported that Trump prefers burgers and meatloaf, Caesar salads and spaghetti, See s Candies and Diet Coke. And he shuns tea, coffee, and alcohol. This was a concern for the POTUS  first trip overseas, but Saudi Arabia has come to the rescue. During Trump s visit, he will be served steak   which Trump likes burnt to a crisp   with ketchup (his favorite) after all.The Associated Press reported on the preparations that must be made for Trump s visit, stating that there were extra steps that needed to be taken just for Trump: People with knowledge of the planning for Trump s trip say the caterers are planning to offer the president steak and ketchup alongside the lamb and hefty portions of rice on the menu. All the meat will have been butchered in a Shariah-compliant halal manner as per Islamic custom. And of course, Trump will probably still find a way to be difficult and ungrateful. The Associated Press wrote: Trump s hosts on his upcoming trip are well-aware of his aversion to travel and are trying to make accommodations to keep him happy. Even if things are going perfectly, we re sure Trump will find a way to complain. He has made outlandish requests before, and just recently canceled a trip to Israel because he wasn t allowed to land his helicopter on top of the mountain fortress of Masada. This kind of diva behavior is humiliating for the country, and we can bank on Trump have some sort of issue while he s overseas.Featured image via Win McNamee / Getty Images",News,"May 19, 2017"

The vocal anti-gun legislator was also drunk and in possession of you guessed it a gun!You probably don t remember her arrest, or maybe you never even knew she was arrested. The media s kinda funny when it comes to covering law-breaking Democrats. So in case you missed it, the woman on her knees with her  hands up  pushing a false narrative that was proven in court to be a lie has decided to join Colin Kaepernick in his public disdain for America.In what she calls a  show of solidarity  with Colin Kaepernick, Missouri State Sen. Jamilah Nasheed, chose to sit as her colleagues stood for the Pledge of Allegiance on the senate floor. Nasheed said that she wants to call attention to the issues that the 49ers player outlines and that she is not  anti-American. Her seat taking was met with complete silence in the chamber.When the session ended however, Lt. Gov. Peter Kinder, a former GOP candidate for governor who presided over the Senate Wednesday, released a statement calling Nasheed s protest an  occasion for great sorrow.  He said he worried about  the example she is setting, particularly for our young people. It is indeed a sad day in this country when out NFL players, Soccer players, and now even members of our government are choosing to address their own beliefs and real issues in our country by completely disrespecting parts of what make us what we are AND they are doing it on the clock as we, the American people, are paying for it.How can it even be considered ethical for such protest to be acted out while on the job? I fully agree that each of these people do in fact have the right to protest how they see fit, but the issue here is that they are using platforms to get the attention they want that are literally funded by the very citizenship that they are showing such a huge disrespect for.Use your free time to protest, not the time in which I as an American citizen am paying for.H/T [ Fox ]",politics,"Sep 16, 2016"
1380, ‘Lock Him Up!’ Passengers Chant To Disruptive Man Wearing MAGA Hat As He’s Removed From Flight (VIDEO),"A passenger wearing a  Make America Great Again  hat in support of alleged president Donald Trump became disruptive on a flight from Shanghai to Newark, New Jersey on Sunday. The man was so unruly that the flight had to be extended by three hours. Eventually, the man had to be removed from the plane. The trouble began when the Trump supporter took another passenger s seat then became disruptive, according to what a spokesman for United told NBC.Local law enforcement had to deal with the unidentified man after passengers were forced to de-plane at the Shanghai airport.The man reportedly  left the aircraft on his own accord  eventually, before the flight departed, the airline said.After the passengers were forced to exit the aircraft and remain in the airport for three long hours, the man walked by the crowd while he was escorted off the plane. That s when chants of  lock him up  rang out, apparently mocking Donald Trump supporters who yelled out the same phrase in chorus during rallies across the country.Cellphone video of the incident was captured by a passenger.Watch:  United said that the flight was forced to make an unscheduled stopover in San Francisco to get a new crew on board and that added several hours to the already lengthy flight.Instead of arriving in Newark at 6:15 p.m. ET as scheduled on Sunday, it didn t touch down in New Jersey until 2:22 a.m. Monday.If you ever want a huge crowd of people angry with you, just make sure their flight is delayed for hours because you wanted another passenger s seat and refused to give it back. Also, too, wear a  Make American Great Again  hat on the flight so that everyone can be warned that you re an arsehole to those around you. You know, like at Trump rallies during the campaign in which protesters were beaten and racial slurs were thrown. Meanwhile, Trump is plagued with scandals that are being compared to Watergate.

A video of a traffic stop by 15th district officers in Philadelphia has gone viral with more than 1 million views. The man in the video says officers abused their power but police are painting a very different picture.28-year-old Tony Soto recorded the traffic stop on his cellphone. I am not anti-police, I support the police. I just don t support police abusing their powers,  Soto told Action News.In the video, Soto showed his license, but refused to show his registration.Police are concerned about Soto s motives and criminal past. We are going to tell our officers to be cautious. It raises your level of suspicion when you have a person   a prior felony   and has had some prior interaction with the law and has been known to interact with guns. So we are going to tell our officers to be careful,  said Lt. John Sanford, Philadelphia Police.Soto sat down with Action News to discuss the controversial video. This traffic stop, just brought to light an ongoing issue that is continually denied all over our nation with individuals being stopped and in some cases being racially profiled,  said Soto.Soto says the officers who stopped him were not African-American but police say differently. They were African American officers,  said Lt. Stanford.The original reason for the stop was for tinted windows.Soto flashed a paper at the officer saying he had a medical exemption from PennDOT for sun screening on his car, but he didn t bring that letter to our meeting. If you were provided that certificate from PennDOT, it has to be colorless tint,  said Lt. Stanford.We asked Soto if his windows were dark tinted. Okay in your opinion or anyone else s opinion from watching the video tape   that s their opinion. No one knows what tint is on my vehicle, whether it s colored or colorless, although it may look dark,  said Soto.And then there s this   in the video, Soto held up a card and badge identifying himself to the officer as a fire marshal.We asked him if he s a fire marshal. The tape speaks for itself and, at this point, okay let s not take the focus as to who I am or what I do or what is going on and let s keep the focus on what is really going on. It is not about Tony Soto,  said Soto.So who is Soto?He s a felon, sentenced to 33 months in federal prison for straw purchasing firearms.He has multiple convictions for theft, fleeing from police, and was convicted of impersonating a public servant in 2005 and now claims he is a volunteer firefighter.We asked Soto where he works. Well we are going to   you are going to stop that right there alright   we are going to stop that and we are not going to go into that,  said Soto.Police are also cautioning the public not to use Soto s video as an example of what to do during a traffic stop.While it is legal to record video, the Pennsylvania vehicle code requires drivers to turn over their identification and registration.In addition, the Fraternal Order of Police is now asking authorities to pursue charges against Soto for allegedly impersonating a public servant.

5590," Racists Try To Fire Actor For Saying Black Lives Matter, Most Powerful Woman In TV Shuts ‘Em Down","Racists and conservatives were very angry that Grey s Anatomy actor Jesse Williams called out racial inequality after receiving a humanitarian award at the recent BET Awards ceremony. In his speech, Williams explained who the award was really for: Now, this award, this is not for me,  he said. This is for the real organizers all over the country, activist civil rights attorneys, the parents, the teachers, the students who are realizing that a system built to divide and impoverish and destroy us cannot stand if we do. All right?  he explained.  It s kind of basic mathematics, the more we learn about who we are and how we got here, the more we will mobilize. Despite its peaceful yearning for racial understanding, for some reason conservatives and racists were set off by the speech. An online petition was launched, asking that Williams be fired from his position on the TV show, and said he  spewed a racist, hate speech against law enforcement and white people at the BET awards.  The petition creator, Erin Smith, compared the speech to racist outbursts from TV personality Paula Deen and a homophobic rant from actor Isaiah Washington.But Shonda Rhimes, the creator and producer of Grey s Anatomy, who has been called the most powerful woman in television, did not bow to the online mob.The ShondaLand producer fired back Monday night at a 7,000 signature-strong Change.org petition calling for ABC to ax Williams   who plays hunky Dr. Jackson Avery on the doctor drama   in light of his much-praised speech inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement. Um, people? Boo don t need a petition. #shondalandrules,  Rhimes tweeted.Rhimes has used her programs to advocate for racial and gender equality, and her programs have been a ratings bonanza for ABC. She currently has four programs on the air; in addition to Grey s they are Scandal, How to Get Away with Murder, and The Catch. She also previously produced Private Practice.Conservatives freaked out previously over an episode of Scandal that showed Kerry Washington s lead character getting an abortion, which has often been a taboo on broadcast prime time TV.Featured image via Flickr",News,"July 6, 2016"
13336,WOW! ANOTHER YOUNG MAN Found DEAD After Serving DNC With Papers In Fraud Suit On Behalf Of Bernie Sanders [VIDEO],"That s the third suspicious death of a man tied in some way to Hillary. Does anyone in law enforcement have an accurate body count of suspicious deaths tied to Hillary? We recently questioned the suspicious murder of 27 year old Democrat Data Director Seth Rich, as he was walking home through his affluent Washington DC neighborhood. He was beaten and shot in the back, but apparently nothing of any value was taken from his body, which would likely mean robbery was not a motive. If robbery wasn t a motive and the police still have no clues what exactly was the motive for his brutal murder? In our previous article, we explored the possibility that he may have been about to blow the whistle on voter fraud. Does anyone have an actual tally of the number of people who had ties to the Clintons that ended up dead? Now Bernie Sanders supporter and activist Shawn Lucas is found dead.On July 3, 2016, Shawn Lucas and filmmaker Ricardo Villaba served the DNC Services Corp. and Chairperson Debbie Wasserman Schultz at DNC s headquarters in Washington, D.C., in the fraud class action suit against the Democrat Party on behalf of Bernie Sanders supporters.Shawn Lucas was thrilled about serving the papers to the DNC before Independence Day.According to Snopes Lucas was found dead on his bathroom floor.We contacted Lucas  employer on 4 August 2016 to ask whether there was any truth to the rumor. According to an individual with whom we spoke at that company, Shawn Lucas died on 2 August 2016. The audibly and understandably shaken employee stated that interest in the circumstances of Lucas  death had prompted a number of phone calls and other queries, but the company had not yet ascertained any details about Lucas  cause of death and were unable to confirm anything more than the fact he had passed away.An unconfirmed report holds that Lucas was found lying on the bathroom floor by his girlfriend when she returned home on the evening of 2 August 2016. Paramedics responding to her 911 call found no signs of life.** This was before Wikileaks released documents proving the DNC was working against the Sanders campaign during the 2016 primary.Shawn Lucas was found dead this week.This follows the death of 27 year-old Democratic staffer Seth Conrad Rich who was murdered in Washington DC on July 8. The killer or killers appear to have taken nothing from their victim, leaving behind his wallet, watch and phone. Shortly after the killing, Redditors and social media users were pursuing a  lead  saying that Rich was en route to the FBI the morning of his murder, apparently intending to speak to special agents about an  ongoing court case  possibly involving the Clinton family.Watch here:And on June 22, 2016, former UN official John Ashe  accidentally  crushed his own throat and died a week before he was scheduled to testify against the Clintons and Democrat Party.Via: Gateway Pundit",politics,"Aug 5, 2016"
18463,BOOM! JOHN SUNUNU: “Bothers Me That Mueller Is Hiring “Blatantly Biased Lawyers” [Video],"Former NH Governor John Sununu let Alison Camarata have it when she asked about the Russia investigation and Robert Mueller. Sununu said that Trump should have been notified if he was under investigation and then he slammed Mueller for hiring all Dems.Camerota:  Should the White House know if the President is being investigated for obstruction of justice? Sununu:  If the President is being investigated for obstruction of justice, the White House should have been officially notified. Sununu:  What bothers me the most and there must be a reason for it, is Mueller making four of his first hires so blatantly biased lawyers, pro-Democrat lawyers with a bias certainly against the President. Maybe Mueller has decided internally that this isn t going anywhere and that the only way he can have credibility on a decision saying that there s nothing there is to have that decision come from a group of lawyers that are so blatantly biased against the President. CNN Reports   Three members of the legal team known to have been hired so far by special counsel Robert Mueller to handle the Russia investigation have given political donations almost exclusively to Democrats, according to a CNN analysis of Federal Election Commission records.",left-news,"Jun 19, 2017"
6387, Patrick Stewart Literally Paid A Guy To Not Vote For Donald Trump (IMAGE),"Patrick Stewart despises Donald Trump so much that he had to make himself feel better by paying a guy to NOT vote for him.The actor most known as Captain Picard in Star Trek: The Next Generation and the X-Men film franchise was in New Orleans earlier this week and spotted a homeless man holding up a sign stating that in exchange for $1 he would not vote for Trump.Not only did Stewart give him $1, he gave him four more dollars on top of that for extra measure. Made me forget the humidity for a moment. Worth 5 bucks,  Stewart wrote on Twitter complete with an image of the man and his sign.Made me forget the humidity for a moment. Worth 5 bucks. pic.twitter.com/lRvEoZ31mF  Patrick Stewart (@SirPatStew) May 11, 2016This isn t the first time Stewart has slammed Donald Trump. Just week ago, he expressed to Vice that he can t believe anyone takes Trump and his  antics  seriously. Well, of course, we had no idea that Dreadful Trump would be up to these antics that he is up to now. And I call them  antics  because how could they possibly be taken seriously. Stewart made the remarks in response to being asked how Donald Trump s extremism and support among white supremacist groups makes his latest film Green Room, in which Stewart portrays a Neo-Nazi, timely.Clearly, Patrick Stewart is not a Donald Trump supporter, and who can blame him?Donald Trump is the scariest political candidate in the presidential race and the fact that a man with strong support from white supremacists and other racist hate groups could very well end up becoming the leader of the free world is a nightmare all too close to turning into reality.Faced with this kind of person in office, perhaps we should all give five dollars to people to keep them from voting for Trump.Featured image via Wikimedia",News,"May 13, 2016"
21620,ABOVE THE LAW: OBAMA’S ‘HOPE’ ARTIST WANTED ON FELONY CHARGES IN DETROIT,"Like Obama and his regime, this Occupier and Obama supporter believes he is above the law. The City of Detroit begs to differ, and would like Fairey to pay them back for the damage he has done to various buildings in the city.  Shepard FaireyFamed street artist Shepard Fairey, who visited Detroit last month to create the largest mural of his career, faces felony charges of tagging other properties across the city on his own time.A warrant for his arrest was filed in 36th District Court on Friday. He faces two counts of malicious destruction of property, which carry a maximum penalty of five years in jail, plus fines that could exceed $10,000.Police, who accuse the artist of causing about $9,000 in damage, said that the next time he comes to Detroit, they will arrest him if he doesn t turn himself in first. Just because he is a well-known artist does not take away the fact that he is also a vandal,  said Detroit Police Sgt. Rebecca McKay, who oversees the city s graffiti task force.  And that s what we consider was done, in these instances, was vandalism. Fairey told the Free Press he intended to leave illegal marks in the city. He arrived in May to paint the 18-story mural on One Campus Martius for Dan Gilbert s Bedrock Real Estate Services and others, but before the work began, he said he would be doing more. I still do stuff on the street without permission. I ll be doing stuff on the street when I m in Detroit,  Fairey said last month. His signature black-and-white Andre the Giant face has since appeared on several buildings downtown, in Eastern Market and along Jefferson Avenue.Fairey s legal troubles in Detroit open a window into the evolution of street art, from its illegal origins into its more professionalized genre recognized in museums and galleries. Fairey has always liked to play both sides of the street, accepting major commissions like the One Campus Martius mural but also retaining his street credibility by continuing to work in the shadows, tagging private property without authorization.An exhibition of Fairey s prints is also currently on view at the Library Street Collective in downtown Detroit. This is a whole genre that s become institutionalized, and you ll always have some outliers go back to where they started and where they get their inspiration,  said Elysia Borowy-Reeder, executive director of the Museum of Contemporary Art Detroit.On another front, the crackdown on illegal graffiti suggests that the reputation Detroit has had for years among artists elsewhere as a kind of Wild Wild West of opportunity needs amending. While inexpensive studio space, a supportive artists  community and the chance to help shape the future of the city remain powerful incentives to live and work in Detroit, the notion that anything goes, including illegal activities that have made the city a haven for unauthorized street art, is no longer true. That reputation lingers but change happens slowly and it s catching up,  said Borowy-Reeder.  The city is becoming more mature. Via: Detroit Free Press ",left-news,"Jun 25, 2015"
22629,HAWKISH DOVE: The Enigma of Donald Trump in Volatile Race to the White House,"Shawn Helton   21st Century WireGOP presidential frontrunner Donald Trump is a populist candidate among a bevy of warhawk rivals  yet many still wonder how the real estate mogul has marched virtually unabated towards the 2016 Republican nomination.Undoubtedly, the stir Trump has caused this election season is already historic. Love him or hate him, the well-known businessman and reality TV star turned American political juggernaut is emerging as a surprising voice for US national interests in the face of an ever-increasing globalized world.Below we ll examine Trump s shocking rise in American politics, his strengths, his weaknesses and what he s up against   HAWKISH DOVE    Who s the real Donald Trump? (Photo illustration Shawn Helton of 21WIRE)The Curious Case of Donald Trump Back in 1993, brothers David and Tom Gardner founded The Motley Fool stockbroker consultancy, and at the time, it took the investment world by storm. Their mantra was simple: in business (as it is most everything else in life) timing is everything, and when a market or system becomes insular and stagnant, the conditions are ripe for a  rule breaker , and eventually, the rule breakers becomes the rule makers. This spirit of guerilla business also underpinned the Silicon Valley revolution in the 1990s and 2000s.Likewise, Donald Trump read the tea leaves and saw an opportunity in 2016.If you believe the United States is ruled by an elite establishment or is a country taken hold by statism, endless foreign intervention and crony corporatism, chances are you might be considering Donald Trump as your candidate of choice in the 2016 presidential election   and you wouldn t be alone. Similar sentiments are felt on the left-wing by supporters of Democratic Party outsider Bernie Sanders.Trump s outsider tag and anti-establishment veneer, is what seems to be resonating most among a broad base across America, as many believe that the country has been in a decline following two failed administrations in the White House under both Bush and Obama.This is the nature of populist campaigns and whether you like Trump or not, he s run one of the most effective presidential campaigns in American history, despite major backlash from the media and various political pressure groups attempting to stop his rise.The New PopulistsMuch like former Republican congressman Ron Paul in 2012, and to a lesser degree with Bernie Sanders, Trump has seemingly tapped into a cultural zeitgeist rarely seen in American politics as this year s preeminent populist choice.While Paul s staunch constitutional and libertarian beliefs propelled his popularity in 2012, it s Trump s cross-spectrum political thinking that s drawing supporters to his campaign marked by an ability to reach the average blue-collar worker, as well as successful entrepreneurs by bringing up issues concerning economic growth, immigration and global trade.To some critics however, Trump is not conservative enough, even though he s already unveiled one of the most comprehensive plans to uphold gun rights in modern history. The plan includes a proposal for nationwide concealed carry without placing a ban on certain types of guns or magazines   something which has become a hot button particularly for those on the left after a string of strange mass shooting events during much of 2015.On the other side of the political fence, many have criticized Trump s antiquated views on expanding torture techniques in the military, as well as his tough talk on internet security, privacy concerns and heavy stance on illegal immigration.The term  super-nationalistic  is being batted around to describe Trump s perspective, causing some to fear the unknown.Ironically, what has led to Trump s success has also hindered him and has arguably become a major weak point for the shrewd businessman.Trump s fiery rhetoric concerning certain issues facing America today, in some cases has worked against him, and has painted a target on him, opening the door for the media to spin anything he says, or doesn t say, or what others say about him.This is perhaps best exemplified with his tough talk on illegal immigration, along with his media counter attack against professional agitators and protesters at his events following several clashes at some of his rallies over the past few weeks.Unfortunately, his detractors and political rivals have already used these social triggers to attack the GOP frontrunner, as his Chicago rally was cancelled after erupting into a chaotic scene, leading to at least 5 arrests. Similarly, his St. Louis rally was also stormed, leading to 32 arrests, with much of the media joining in condemnation of the embattled businessman.While no one should condone the violence that results from Trump supporters clashing with outside political agitators at Trump s campaign events, critics insist that Trump has somehow escalated these volatile protests through his own incendiary language and for not using his powers of persuasion to  calm things down. Later on in this article, we ll take an even closer look at what s behind these seismic uprisings at Trump s campaign rallies.The Manhattan mogul s political story has only just begun and there are many things to consider concerning the embattled GOP frontrunner   WAR LIES    Former Secretary of State, Colin Powell and the Bush administration s findings revealed a highly coordinated disinformation campaign that led to over half a million deaths in the US-led invasion in Iraq in 2003. (Photo link foreignpolicyjournal)Alternative To War?Recently, Trump was pressed again on matters concerning the Middle East and his response has been surprisingly diplomatic with a non-interventionist platform. Trump s open condemnation of the Bush administration for the Iraq war and the Obama White House for the destruction of Libya, has resonated across the board for voters on both sides of the political spectrum. Trump has asserted that 2003 s invasion in Iraq and the blitzkrieg in Libya via NATO members in 2011, is further evidence of failed US foreign policy throughout the world.Doubling down, the GOP frontrunner Trump, has also refused to pick a side between Israel and Palestine   and in true form to his business pedigree, stating that he would rather attempt to broker a peace deal in the ages old conflict, rather than tow the party line.Calling Out  Bad  Global Trade   TRANS PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP    US leaders vote in favor of cloaked trade deal involving Asia pacific countries and America in 2015. Trump has been the only presidential candidate talking about the Trans Pacific Partnership trade deal and its vast implications on the global economy.The Trans Pacific Partnership or TPP trade deal, is something we ve covered extensively at 21WIRE over the past two years, as international trade law for new trade treaties appear to be a way for private corporations to exempt themselves from the laws of sovereign nations under the guise of a so-called free-trade agreement.As global policy makers continue to merge with the interests of multinational or transnational corporations to achieve their goals, we could view the TTP or the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) as having zero national loyalty to any existing nation-state or its set of laws.These multi-national and transnational free trade deals have been vigorously opposed by Trump during many GOP debates this election cycle. Other critics of these deals have suggested they are being used as a way to gain a foothold on  property rights  in the future, in addition to having lasting implications on intellectual property.21WIRE previously outlined the role that the United States Trade  Representative has played in facilitating these deals between different industries: Understanding the power structure behind these draconian trade deals reveals the global chess play at work and the behind-the-scenes corporate merger s, under the watch of a biased government entity, the USTR. The USTR has been doing heavy lifting through its corporate connections with the likes of Haliburton (ESG and KBR) and Monsanto Corp, and  political insider  ties for a massive trade deal that will consolidate our future   all done outside of the democratic process.  This past week, Huffington Post published an article entitled  At Secretive Meeting, Tech CEOs And Top Republicans Commiserate, Plot To Stop Trump, : Billionaires, tech CEOs and top members of the Republican establishment flew to a private island resort off the coast of Georgia this weekend for the American Enterprise Institute s annual World Forum, according to sources familiar with the secretive gathering. The article goes on to say that the participants  couldn t help  discussing Trump   but he was not the sole purpose of the meeting. Here s some of the list of attendees as reported by HuffPo: Apple CEO Tim Cook, Google co-founder Larry Page, Napster creator and Facebook investor Sean Parker, and Tesla Motors and SpaceX honcho Elon Musk all attended. So did Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), political guru Karl Rove, House Speaker Paul Ryan, GOP Sens. Tom Cotton (Ark.), Cory Gardner (Colo.), Tim Scott (S.C.), Rob Portman (Ohio) and Ben Sasse (Neb.), who recently made news by saying he  cannot support Donald Trump. Recently, it was reported by Cleveland.com that  Ohio lost 112,500 jobs in 2015 resulting from the United States  trade deficit with countries that are part of the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, according to an analysis by the Economic Policy Institute. Additionally, the EPI s findings state that an estimated 2 million jobs have already been lost due to the TPP and that half of those were in manufacturing industry.Above all else, Trump s non-interventionist outlook on the Middle East and his diplomatic approach to Israel and Palestine, as well as his strong position on free trade deals such as the TPP and TTIP, have all contributed to placing the outspoken candidate on the political chopping block.Such is the curious case of Donald J. Trump   AMERICAN PSYCHO?    Former presidential candidate Mitt Romney propelled Trump s campaign despite his desperate appeal to the public last week in a staged pre-debate speech. (Photo link cowgernation)Political Attack DogsThe anti-Trump coalition consists of the Republican Party establishment, the Leftwing and the mainstream media   and each of these factions are presently at war with Trump and his campaign.From the onset, you could see the horror in TV broadcasters eyes when confronted by Trump   a media mogul himself who knows how to conduct a symphony on the airwaves. In many respects, he s their worst nightmare   a politician who can outplay them in their media manipulation game.For the American Leftwing, he induces revulsion, and for good reason   his ability to tame the media has enabled him to discard the political correctness which governs US media discourse.The most sustained attack however, is coming from his own party. In the September of 2015, here at 21WIRE, we discussed how neoconservatives within the Republican Party were incensed when Trump first launched his presidential campaign bid over the summer. Flashing forward to now, it s even more apparent that the media and the dying GOP party elite have attempted to shanghai Trump and the public during his unexpected political rise.Since last summer, there s been a host of media pundits and Washington figureheads looking to take on Trump in a kinda of metaphorical Thunderdome, something which has routinely played out before millions of TV viewers   and one by one, each has become politically castrated, spayed or otherwise cast aside by the outspoken tycoon.You don t have to take my word for it, just ask Meghan Kelley, Lindsay Graham, Jeb Bush, as well as former FOX News favorite and PNAC (Project for a New American Century) waving neocon, Marco Rubio   a list, that may now include Mitt Romney, following his dirty, scripted propaganda speech meant to quell Trump s primary rise.It seems this year more than any other, the American public has peeled away at the politically fixed halls of FOX, CNN and others, as mainstream networks have deliberately attempted to derail Trump through a plethora of designer media attacks, timely  gotcha  questions, ambush-style interviews and scripted debate forums working in concert to keep the apparent GOP outsider off-balance throughout the entire presidential nomination process.  Astute observers of the GOP nomination process, might conclude that many media personalities, political insiders and beltway lobbyists are comfortable with America s long ago chartered cruise towards global ambiguity and perpetual stagnation, rather than to take a chance on new blood.In fact, The Grand Old Party pet-parade nearly flatlined last week after enlisting Bain Capital businessman and former Governor of Massachusetts, Mitt Romney to unleash a scathing nationally televised assessment of Trump s presidential qualifications.Bain Capital, is an investment firm with a rich history of litigation concerning claims of disgruntled investors over profits, as well as a global company with big ties to military defense, aerospace and big agricultural giants like Monsanto.Romney s recent pre-GOP debate speech appeared to be a last-ditch effort directed by neoconservative strategists to silence Trump s campaign   but it led to a huge backlash and in the process, revealed the former governor s role as political spoiler (and thus damaged goods), as evidenced by his support of Bush-approved candidate John Kasich.Romney s speech, piggy-backed anti-Trump hashtag campaigns (#nevertrump and #stoptrump) that emerged in the weeks following an article by well-known neoconservative strategist, Peter Wehner on why he wouldn t support a Trump presidency.Here s a You Tube clip of Fox News contributor Judge Jeanine Pirro condemning Romney for awakening a sleeping giant  among the US electorate The Shape of ThingsMitt Romney and the billionaire boys club are out for blood.Trump is using big media to put out some  dangerous ideas    like the prospect for a peace deal between Israel and Palestine, and d tente with Russia, and also calling out the clear fraud of the Iraq War, as well as NATO s bombardment in Libya as Trump stated, Libya would be better off if we had left Gaddafi in power. If the politicians had gone to the beach instead, and did nothing, we d be better off in Libya and Iraq than we are today. Romney represents the financial and investment wing of the military industrial complex and an Israel first foreign policy. Along with John McCain, Romney is one of their  inside men  embedded inside the US political establishment.This is what Trump is really up against.It doesn t stop there, the dirty politricks continued this week as Rubio urged his supporters to vote for rival presidential candidate and Governor of Ohio John Kasich (a close Bush-family friend), with the Florida Senator stating, If you re a Republican primary voter in Ohio, and you don t want Donald Trump to be the nominee, John Kasich is your best bet. Incidentally, Jeb Bush met with  three non-Trump candidates  (Cruz, Rubio Kasich?) in Miami this week, a month after dropping out of the presidential race, due to his poor campaign results. The situation was described by the Wall Street Journal as the following: Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who ended his 2016 candidacy last month after months of sparring with Mr. Trump, met with each of the three non-Trump candidates this week in Miami, though he hasn t offered direction on how to block Mr. Trump s path. On another interesting note, early in March, according to The Hill, CEO of FOX News, Roger Ailes, dropped his support for Rubio, if true, the move would signify this latest strategy to use Romney and Kasich as a way to undermine Trump s campaign. Here s the excerpt reported by The Hill: We re finished with Rubio,  Roger Ailes told one of the network s hosts recently, according to three unnamed sources.  We can t do the Rubio thing anymore. Flashing forward to this past week, Trump loyalist Roger Stone, wrote a revealing article entitled  Ted Cruz, A Bush By Another Name,  which detailed GOP presidential candidate Ted Cruz s close relationship to the Bush family. Here s a  passage from Stone s recent piece at The Daily Caller: Neil Bush, the son of President George H. W. Bush, who defrauded U.S. taxpayers out of $1.5 billion dollars in the savings and loan scam, and later peddled influence for the Chinese government, (who plied him with Chinese prostitutes) has formally endorsed Senator Ted Cruz for president. You can t make this stuff up. The Bush-Cruz connection is clear. Ted was George W. s brain when he ran for president. A top policy adviser, Ted maneuvered for Solicitor General in Bush World but settled for a plum at the Federal Trade Commission. Ted s a Bush man with deep ties to the political and financial establishment.  Ted and wife Heidi brag about being the first  Bush marriage    they met as Bush staffers. SEE ALSO: Ted Cruz comes up  empty  on Obamacare as government continues debt scamAs the political claws are fully out now, the recent words of Pulitzer prize nominated journo, Jon Rappoport, comes to mind: A true populist leader would accept the fact that working through usual channels, to bring about stunning changes, is a loser. The enemy is entrenched. The enemy controls the landscape. The enemy controls the machinery. Where is the populist s strength coming from? Only one place: the people who are supporting him. So he has to go back to that well, over and over again. And now he can. While pondering Trump s rivals and populism, there s a deeper agenda concerning 2016 and beyond, something which was recently pointed out here at 21WIRE.In October of 2014, The Boston Globe published a stirring article rarely seen in the mainstream entitled  Vote all you want. The secret government won t change. The Globe piece covered Tufts University political scientist Michael J. Glennon s detailed perspective on the political process in America. The article included an in-depth discussion about Glennon s book  National Security and Double Government,  a book that gives the public an inside look into the collusion between neoconservative and neoliberal political strategy on the global stage   in particular, counterterrorism policies that are routinely followed by president after president.The idea of concealed policy between neoconservatives and neoliberals was further confirmed when Robert Kagan, a co-founder and co-author of The Project for the New American Century, recently endorsed Hillary Clinton for President.This was a big story, but it barely kept the media s attention span for longer than a week.Indeed, Kagan s endorsement should provide a window for people to see the so-called (neo) conservative players behind the scenes that might have helped Clinton escape the Benghazi scandal and might step in to rescue her from her ongoing national security related email case with the FBI.Clinton s exploits in Libya are well documented and her recent endorsement by neocon strategist Kagan, is just one more glaring example of political complicity, no matter who gets elected as the president of America, the foreign policy machinations are controlled by the same operators.Coincidentally or not, Kagan also appears to be linked to Romney s anti-trump plea to the public.In a catchy call to arms, a deeply biased political plea was published on the website called War On The Rocks. The piece featured an impassioned rant from those directly connected to the military industrial complex. In fact, many war party operatives, put their seal of approval on the message including Robert Kagan, as well as Former Homeland Security secretary, Michael Chertoff, (the Chertoff Group manufactured the TSA body scanners used in most major airports) as well as over hundred other political operatives.To those aware of these tactics, the War On The Rocks Trump hit-piece, read like a foreign policy business as usual dossier, with a heavy-handed characterization of mogul, while completely misrepresenting some of Washington s most notorious military interventions in recent memory.  TRUMP CARD    Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump posters adorn Trump s Nevada caucus rally. (Photo link ulinet)Socially Engineered  Flash Mobs  Go Viral The political game changers are fully after the Trump campaign now, as the George Soros funded advocacy group MoveOn, played a large role in the Chicago University student organized shutdown at the Trump rally this past Friday, as well as a host of other splinter groups associated with Black Lives Matter (BLM) and supporters for Bernie Sanders.  BLACK BLOC   Black bloc provocateurs, have violently escalated protest movements since the 1980 s, including 2011 s Occupy Wall Street Movement. (Photo link examiner)The echoes are still felt from the Soros funded protests in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014 and the Baltimore riots of 2015, something which immediately recalls the misguided machinations of The Occupy Movement (aka OWS) in 2011, an event that turned out to be a think-tank-spun divide and conquer stratagem designed to push naive participants into violent action.  CHICAGO CHAOS    Bernie Sanders supporters join Black Lives Matter linked groups to shutdown Trump rally. (Photo link twitter)Back in January, MoveOn publicly endorsed the Bernie Sanders campaign in what appeared to be a call to action for BLM associated groups seen backing Sanders. It s worth mentioning, that MoveOn, also supported the Obama campaign in 2008, according to the website, Sanders is the only other candidate to  threshold for an endorsement. From here on out, professional political agitator flash mobs, will be mobilized at future Trump campaign events, making it very difficult to run a normal campaign   taking away Trump s strength in numbers at his rallies. This was confirmed in Ohio recently, after a BLM activist and Sanders supporter, stormed the stage, shortly after Trump started speaking.In a Politico article entitled  Major donors consider funding Black Lives Matter,  we gain deeper insight into the political funding for BLM and the Soros linked Democratic Alliance: Major donors are usually not as radical or confrontational as activists most in touch with the pain of oppression,  said Steve Phillips, a Democracy Alliance member and significant contributor to Democratic candidates and causes. He donated to a St. Louis nonprofit group called the Organization for Black Struggle that helped organize 2014 Black Lives Matter-related protests in Ferguson, Missouri, over the police killing of a black teenager named Michael Brown. And Phillips and his wife, Democracy Alliance board member Susan Sandler, are in discussions about funding other groups involved in the movement. It worth noting Soros, a long time contributor to Hillary Clinton, donated $2 million in PAC money in 2015 and January of 2016, Soros reportedly gave $8 million to  boost  Clinton s campaign. Soros also recently funded $15 million to Latino groups looking to stop Trump s rise towards a potential GOP nomination and beyond.Any bloodshed at the hands of   vigilante mobs  at Trump rallies, should be the responsibility of those who of have sought to politicize and fund this agenda from the very beginning.Look for these political engineers, to pit choreographed conservative and liberal groups against each other at Trump s rallies or events in the future   as all of these hostile uprisings are by design.During the Days of Rage in 1969, the FBI was said to have been  tracking specific members  of the Students for a Democratic Society. The SDS was heavily connected to 60 s political agitators turned domestic terrorists, The Weather Underground. Many concluded that the group s leader, Bill Ayers, was an interloper looking for new recruits that were easily manipulated into hostile action.This begs the question: Are government agencies still infiltrating political advocacy groups to push social change?The disruptions at Trump rallies are a form of modern class warfare, one that disguises its true intentions, eroding national sovereignty through a series of upheavals, while presenting shock and awe imagery in order to manipulate the public s political perspective.Amazingly through it all, Trump s still been able to confound his opposition in the aftermath of a barrage of attacks, propelling his popularity even to even higher levels.The Ides of March primaries will be a good barometer to see what impact these chaotic clashes may have on Trump s campaign moving forward.It still remains to be seen if Trump s dynamic political vision for America will push the country further into authoritarianism or whether he can unite an embattled nation by restoring international relations throughout the world.But one thing is for sure   there s no doubt now that a systematic design is in place to unseat the GOP frontrunner and the public should question why READ MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 Files",US_News,"March 14, 2016"

14541,THE REAL TRUTH ABOUT WHY OBAMA Is Planting Muslim Refugees In Small Towns Across America,"This is the best explanation of why Obama and the Democrat party are fighting so hard to keep the US State Department s Refugee Resettlement program going strong.  Please share this with everyone who s been wondering why the Democrats are so eager to bring Muslim immigrants from countries who hate us, to America, while leaving Christian refugees from the same countries behind. To hell with terrorism, the Democrats want to win even if it s at the expense of our national security Looks like my old stomping grounds in Montana are heating up. People there are not taking Obama s plan to force refugees on them lying down. There was a protest in Missoula, Montana recently over that very issue. It is just one of many battles brewing out there in small town America.Small towns in the sparsely populated parts of America are the perfect place to relocate these refugees. Especially, if your agenda includes politically terraforming the country. The West is historically conservative in their politics. Many are Republicans and Libertarians. Even the Democrats hearken back to an earlier time when they were more conservative in nature. Obama and the Democrats can t have that. They need to have an entire country willing to submit to Marxist diktats. They need areas seeded with those who will vote Democrat and ensure that they stay in power no matter what.And it s not just voting demographics that are pushing this move either. I personally believe that there is a warped logic to all of this. That if Islam can be made the predominant religion in America, people will be more easily controlled. That s insane of course and won t work, but there you have it. Instead, Shariah law will be implemented and you will see the same atrocities occurring in Europe happen here. The big difference being, that at least for now, Americans are armed and will use those weapons to protect their neighbors, loved ones and country.Of the 237 Syrian refugees admitted to the U.S. since the attacks in Paris just one has been a Christian. The rest have been Muslims.CNS News reports that according to data from the State Department Refugee Processing Center, since the November 13 attacks the U.S. has admitted 236 Sunni Muslim refugees from Syria and a single Christian   a Greek Orthodox refugee.Bringing in the refugees also moves forward the Cloward and Piven strategy to overwhelm the system so it will collapse and cause chaos in the streets. These people want to tear the system apart, so they can replace it with something truly heinous. The Obama administration will never admit that this is the plan, but can you honestly look at what is going on today and tell me it isn t? Our borders are wide open. We are not vetting anyone to speak of and security here in the US is worse than before 9/11.Communities in states such as Idaho, Montana, North Dakota and Kansas are being infused with Muslim refugees even though they are not wanted by the residents or the local law enforcement. The feds and their leaders are not giving them a choice. Wyoming is the only state currently not participating in the program, but even the governor there wants to jump in it. Living in large cities would be too costly for the refugees and more can be accomplished with seeding them across the plains. In a small town, they can turn everything to their advantage in short order. Since many of our larger cities are already flooded with immigrants from south of the border and from Muslim nations, in many respects they have at least partially fallen to the ploy already. This is the fundamental transformation of America in play. South Carolina, Idaho, Minnesota, North Dakota and Michigan are vigorously fighting against this program and Obama s  change .The same entitlements, jobs, lodging and freebies will be given to these refugees in small town America. But that will mean taking more and more away from locals in these same communities. These immigrants bring crime and disease with them. As crime rises, people will leave which will hasten the take over of these towns. At least that is what Obama and his friends hope for. I pray that people dig in and decide to stay and fight if they can.We haven t learned a damned thing from watching what is going on over in Europe. How do you justify the rapefugees in Germany and Sweden, who treat rape as game for a large number of players at a given event? How can you ignore the violence, the murders, the depravity that is the Ummah? What s wrong with these people? Do money and power mean so much to them that they don t care that they are selling America out to a hellish nightmare movement? Imagine your wives, daughters, mothers, neighbors  little children  subjected to these beasts. What would you do?For entire story: Trevor Loudon ",politics,"Feb 3, 2016"

22693,McPain: John McCain Furious That Iran Treated US Sailors Well,"21st Century Wire says As 21WIRE reported earlier this week, the unlikely  mishap  of two US Naval vessels straying into Iranian waters   just hours before the President s State of the Union speech, followed by the usual parade of arch-neocons coming on TV in real time to declare the incident as  an act of aggression  by Iran against the United States   is no mere coincidence.24 hours after the incident, the Iranians returned all 11 US sailors, unharmed and in good spirits. The only remaining casualty from this event was an incident of a common condition in Washington known as  Pre-Traumatic Stress Disorder    suffered by a certain US Senator was mortified by the uneventful outcome which followed Daniel McAdams Ron Paul Institute  The two US Navy riverine command boats intercepted in Iranian territorial waters yesterday were sent on their way along with the crew of 10 US sailors after brief detention on Iranian soil.According to news reports, the well-armed warships either suffered mechanical or navigational difficulties which caused them to enter Iranian territory (although it may well have been a game of cat-and-mouse to test the Iranian response). The US sailors were apparently treated well, enjoyed what appeared a decent meal in relaxed surroundings, and in the end apologized for the mistake and praised their treatment by the Iranians. Thanks to President Obama s policy shift on Iran toward engagement and away from isolationism, Secretary of State John Kerry was able to telephone his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Zarif and quickly defuse what just months ago would have been a far more serious situation.This should be a good-news story about the value of diplomacy and reducing tensions with adversaries, but Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) was having none of it. That Kerry expressed his appreciation to the Iranians for swiftly releasing the American sailors only showed the Obama Administration s  craven desire to preserve the dangerous Iranian nuclear deal at all costs evidently knows no limit,  said McCain in a press release.McCain was furious that  Obama administration officials seem to be falling over themselves to offer praise for Iran s graciousness  and was outraged that the Iranians dared interfere with the actions of US military vessels operating in Iranian waters.In the world of John McCain, only the United States has the right to national sovereignty. The US military has the right to act anywhere and everywhere and the rest of the world dare not raise a question.According to McCain,  sovereign immune naval vessels are exempt from detention, boarding, or search. Their crews are not subject to detention or arrest. Imagine the tune McCain would have been singing if a well-armed Iranian naval vessel had been spotted in US territorial waters off the coast of New York. Would he have so rigorously condemned any US interference in the actions of Iran s sovereign naval vessels?Leave it to some clever Twitterers to post an example of the difference between US and Iranian detention.Copyright   2016 by RonPaul Institute.

2302, Congressman Tells Trump He’s In ‘Deep S**t’ If Wiretapping Conspiracy Is True — And He’s Right (DETAILS),"Donald Trump may have just inadvertently admitted guilt during his bizarre and conspiracy riddled claim that President Obama ordered the Trump Tower to be wiretapped.In a flurry of early morning tweets (how s that pivot going, Republicans), President Trump accused President Obama, as early as October, with launching a Nixonian-McCarthy-esque witch hunt against his campaign in order to undermine him.Once again, President Trump has shown a complete lack of understanding about the separation of powers enshrined in the United States Constitution. Contrary to popular (right-wing) belief, the President of the United States does not have the authority to order a wiretapping of an individual s house, phone, or place or business.But don t take our word for it. Let Democratic Congressman Ted Lieu of California explain it:Mr. President: If there was a wiretap at Trump Tower, that means a fed judge found probable cause of crime which means you are in deep shit. https://t.co/i7dUMtHXmo  Ted Lieu (@tedlieu) March 4, 2017In case that wasn t enough, let him explain it one more time:Either @realDonaldTrump is paranoid like Nixon, or judge found probable cause of crime for #wiretap. Either way our President is in trouble.  Ted Lieu (@tedlieu) March 4, 2017Lieu is right: either way you look at it, Trump is in trouble. He is either painfully ignorant of the Constitution; has done something that would warrant probable cause (which could be criminal); or both. Our money is on both. He s demonstrated that he completely off his rockers and ill-equipped for the office of the presidency.Even if President Obama did recommend that Trump s phones and buildings be tapped (which is highly unlikely, but if true, THANKS OBAMA!), it certainly wouldn t be without merit. Since August   with the resignation of Paul Manafort, intelligence officials have been looking into whether or not the Trump campaign was in collusion with the Russian government. And over the last several months, many damning revelations have come out about the campaign s contacts, which were previously denied.Maybe the Trump white House should be bugged. Their lack of transparency and honesty has been frightening and beneath the awesome responsibility of the Executive Branch.Maybe this wiretapped information (if it happened) is the information Comey and the FBI is withholding, according to Senator Ron Wyden.Only time will tell.

21762,REFUGEE BUSINESS IS CASH COW FOR LUTHERAN CHARITY IN MI AND OTHER STATES,"How very  charitable  of the Lutheran and Catholic churches to bring tens of thousands of refugees to America, dump them off, and expect the American taxpayer to fund their existence Michigan Congresswoman Brenda Lawrence cheers the news that more money is coming to her district for illegal aliens magically transformed into refugees.What she won t understand until it is too late, is that the arrival of thousands of refugees in Michigan will squeeze Americans, especially the African Americans, at the bottom rung of the pay scale. Michigan is in the top five states receiving refugees and yet they are adding alien children into the mix.But, what the heck, even as states increase poverty, these  church  groups have to make a living!From the Detroit Free Press:WASHINGTON   The Obama administration has awarded a Michigan social services group $2.2 million to house unaccompanied immigrant children, U.S. Rep. Brenda Lawrence announced today. US Rep Brenda Lawrence is happy that the Lutherans are flooding Michigan with refugees and alien children. It was not immediately known how many children would receive or had received residential services under the grant to Lutheran Social Services of Michigan or whether any other groups were receiving grants in the state as well.No surprise! No one will return calls!Calls and emails to Lutheran Social Services of Michigan and the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, from the Free Press seeking more information were not immediately returned.According to data on the ORR s website, only 235 unaccompanied immigrant children had been placed in Michigan in the last two years, far less than the number placed in neighboring states including Ohio. [I wonder if the new grant is in anticipation of Michigan getting more of the UACs ed]Some 63,000 undocumented children have been placed throughout the U.S. in the last two years, the ORR s website said.In announcing the grant, Lawrence, D-Southfield, said the grant assists unaccompanied minors who  seek relief from the violence and poverty that threatens their very existence in their home countries. They can hardly be described as being faith-based while living off of taxpayer boodle! Doesn t sound like Christian charity to me! Lutheran Social Services truly lives up to their faith-based mission statement to serve the people most in need of help and I am proud to see them receive this substantial federal grant,  she said, adding that she believes it also time for Congress to address comprehensive immigration reform.Lutheran Social Services of Michigan is the largest refugee resettlement agency in the state, Lawrence said, providing thousands of families from dozens of countries.So, it is the Lutherans resettling most of the Muslim refugees to Michigan?Other of the nine major contractors are also busy overloading Michigan, go here to see the handy list of subcontractors/contractors working in Michigan and your state too!For new readers, for years we have covered the  unaccompanied minors  (one of the government s original names for the youths illegally crossing the border). Click here for all of our previous posts.The US Conference of Catholic Bishops and Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service were the two  big dogs  doing the  resettlement  of the children (Obama s new refugees) until two other federal contractors eclipsed them.

20905,HILLARY TO OBAMA: “call off your f–king dogs”,"According to insider, and author Edward Klein, Hillary took on Barack Obama over his involvement in exposing her email scandal several months ago. Many Americans are wondering if Obama is stonewalling the FBI s  investigation, or if in fact, he is encouraging the investigation, hoping it will take her down.  This isn t the first report of Hillary behaving in a manner that is, shall we say,  un-presidential?   According to White House insiders, it seems that Bill has been on the receiving end of Hillary s rage more than once as well   An enraged Hillary Rodham Clinton blew up at President Obama, demanding he  call off your f king dogs  looking into her emails during a tense Oval Office meeting, according to a new book.The book,  Unlikeable: The Problem with Hillary,  says the former first lady was furious at what she believed were damaging leaks by Obama aides that led to investigations of her use of a private email server as secretary of state. So she went right to the top to settle the matter.Clinton requested a meeting with Obama, against the advice of hubby Bill Clinton, believing  she was being persecuted for minor, meaningless violations,  author Edward Klein writes.Clinton initially took a friendly approach during the meeting and Obama reacted as if he didn t know what she was talking about, the book claims. He was almost being deliberately dense,  a Clinton source said.  It really angered her. Clinton lost her temper and called the president by his first name in an emotionally driven break with White House decorum, according to the book. What I want for you to do is call off your f king dogs, Barack!  Clinton allegedly barked at Obama, according to Klein s account, which cited sources close to Clinton and Obama senior adviser Valerie Jarrett.The president was so stunned by Clinton s disrespectful demands, he needed a moment to compose himself, the book claims.Obama then responded,  There is nothing I can do for you one way or another. Things have been set in motion, and I can t and won t interfere. Your problems are, frankly, of your own making. If you had been honest . . . Klein reports Clinton interrupted,  There are always haters out there to get the Clintons. The Democratic 2016 front-runner is said to have later regretted her tirade against the president   not for the disrespect she showed, but for the weakness she displayed.Nick Merrill, Clinton s spokesman, called Klein s account  bulls t. Another book? Someone should do a book about Ed,  said Merrill.  They could call it  Bulls t: The Problem with Anything Ed Klein Writes. The only true thing about him is his consistent and utter lack of a relationship with the facts,  Merrill said.  He has more hair than credibility, and the man is bald. So we re not going to get down in the gutter with him and his outrageous fabrications.  Via: NYPHillary s on a mission to be a softer, warmer, funnier candidate   but according to a new book, the real Hillary Clinton is so volatile and prone to violent outbursts that she terrorizes staff, Secret Service agents and even her own husband. Hillary Clinton has a long history of being domestically violent with Bill,  Stone writes.  Hillary has beaten Bill, hit him with hard objects, scratched and clawed him, and made him bleed.

21356,RADICAL NY Attorney General Cracking Down On Conservatism…Working To Make Opposing The Left A Crime,"Lois Lerner s criminal behavior with the IRS targeting of conservatives was just a test run Here s a little reminder for anyone who doesn t believe that what the left really wants is a totalitarian state in which opposition to its agenda is a crime.New York s Attorney General Eric Schneiderman is extreme even by left-wing standards. He s a radical who ran by promising that violent racist thug Al Sharpton would have an  annex  in Albany if he won.Now Schneiderman and a few left-wing congressmembers have come up with a great idea. Charge Exxon with securities fraud for not  disclosing  the risks of Global Warming.Whether on not any charges happen, this is a foot in the door for an agenda list that goes well beyond Global Warming.After energy companies that aren t paying protection money to Al Gore, gun manufacturers can be hit with charges for not  disclosing the risks  of gun violence. Private prisons can be hit for not disclosing the risks of failing to back sentencing reforms. Educational companies can be hit with charges for not disclosing the risks of not adopting Common Core.Basically any company that disagrees with a left-wing policy can be hit with civil and criminal charges. It helps if the company, like Exxon, at one point employed kooks who claimed the sky was falling. But that just makes the case easier. If the executives disagree with a left-wing policy, it s securities fraud.Under this standard, it becomes child s play to cut off conservative organization from any corporate funding. Furthermore, conservative organizations would be muzzled by extension. Funding organizations and people that dissent from the left would be  fraud . Because that is what this is really about.Global Warming is the testbed for making leftist ideology mandatory. Manufacture a fake consensus, then use the law to make it mandatory.Then there can be a pseudo-scientific consensus on a variety of issues, such as the need for higher taxes, and a crackdown on anyone who disagrees.Since there s money in pursuing charges like this, and since the best way to get the left off your back is to give their political allies money, this is robbery for tyranny. And that s how the left does business.This is where the left has always been headed. This is a totalitarian movement. Via: Front Page Magazine",left-news,"Nov 9, 2015"
15447,"[Video] DEM PREZ CANDIDATE BOOED OFF STAGE, FORCED TO APOLOGIZE FOR SAYING “All Lives Matter”","When you have a crowd of people listening to this kind of idiotic drama, I think it s safe to say you should expect to be booed off the stage if you don t tow the line. Here r the Black Net Roots speaker s dramatic introduction for Governor O Malley: Let s be clear  Every single day folks are dying! Not being able to take another breath! We are in a state of emergency! We are in a state of emergency and if you don t fill that emergency you are not human!   As the Washington Examiner noted Saturday, former Maryland governor and current presidential candidate Martin O Malley was being interviewed at the annual Netroots Nation conference and was making a statement about the need for civilian police review boards. The interview was interrupted by a group of protestors chanting,  Say,  black lives matter!  In response to a question by one of the protestors about alleged instances of police brutality against African Americans, O Malley stated,  I think all of us have a responsibility to recognize the pain and grief caused by lives lost to violence. Black lives matter. White lives matter. All lives matter.  The statement is said to have drawn boos from the crowd. A minute or two later, O Malley apologized.The incident illustrated neatly illustrated the cultural divide between the left and the rest of America. Most people, without much of a thought, would agree that all lives matter, whether they belong to someone killed in an altercation with police or   say   a Marine gunned down by a terrorist. The crowd at Netroots Nation disagreed.More importantly, O Malley failed the  Sister Souljah  test by apologizing for saying something that should be axiomatic. A  Sister Souljah Moment  refers to an incident during the 1992 presidential campaign in which then Governor Bill Clinton condemned a rapper named Sister Souljah for racially incendiary lyrics in some of her songs. The statement caused a great deal of consternation, but Clinton received praise for taking on an extremist who was part of an important Democratic constituency. Clinton went on to be elected and then reelected four years later.  Via: The Examiner",politics,"Jul 21, 2015"
22755,Reflections on a World Gone Mad and Pushing Back against Neocolonialist Thuggery," Andre Vltchek Anti DiplomaticoThe following is an interview with ANDRE VLTCHEK by ALESSANDRO BIANCCHI, Chief Editor of the Italian political magazine Anti-Diplomatico:ALESSANDRO BIANCHI: Self-determination of peoples and respect for the borders and sovereignty of a country. This is of the most complicated issue for international law. How can it be articulated for the case of Catalonia?ANDRE VLTCHEK: Personally, I m not very enthusiastic about smaller nations forming their own states, particularly those in the West, where they would, after gaining  independence , remain in the alliances that are oppressing and plundering the entire world: like NATO or the European Union.Clearly, the breaking of the great country of Yugoslavia into small pieces was a hostile, evil design by the West, and particularly of Germany and Austria. The dissolution of Czechoslovakia after the so-called  Velvet Revolution  was a total idiocy.But Catalonia (or Basque Country), if it became independent, would become one of the richest parts of Europe. I don t think it would have any great positive or negative impact on the rest of the world. As an internationalist, I don t really care if they are separate from Spain or not, or whether they are even richer than they already are, as I care much more about what is happening in places such as Afghanistan, Venezuela or North Korea.On the other hand, the way Spain has now behaved in Catalonia, after the referendum, is a total disgrace. They decided to treat the Catalan people in the same way as Indonesians have been treating Papuans for decades. If this continues, it will all reach the point of no return: reconciliation will become impossible. You cannot start sexually harassing women and then break their fingers, one by one, just because they want to have their own state. You cannot injure hundreds of innocent people, who simply don t want to be governed from Madrid. That s absurd and thoroughly sick! Of course Spain used to commit holocausts all over what is now called Latin America, so it is  in their blood . But I don t think Catalans will allow this to be done to them.What about the constitution of Spain? Look, there should be nothing sacred about constitutions. In the West, they were written to protect the interests of the ruling classes. When they get outdated, they should be moderated, or totally rewritten. If Catalans or Basques want their independence, if they really want it, if it is so important for them, then why not   they should have it. Spain is not a  people s country . It is an oppressive Western bully. I would have a totally different position if some part of Bolivia or China were to try to secede.AB: Different situation and different reality. Another issue of fundamental international concern in this period is the referendum of Iraqi Kurdistan, which is likely to become the new fuse ready to explode in that area. Would it be the new Israel in the Middle East as someone has affirmed?AV: Well, that is really a very serious issue. I have worked in the Kurdish autonomous region of Iraq already twice, even on the  border  with Mosul, and what I saw there I did not like at all!It is clearly a  client  state of the West, of Turkey and to some extent, Israel. It is shamelessly capitalist, taking land from its own people, cheating them, just in order to pump and refine huge quantities of oil. It treats Syrian refugees like animals, forcing them to make anti-Assad statements. It is turning ancient Erbil into some bizarre shopping mall with nothing public in sight. Its military top brass is mainly US/UK-trained and indoctrinated. And it provokes Baghdad, day and night.I really strongly disliked what I saw there. If Iraqi Kurds were allowed to have their  independence , the impact on the region would be huge and certainly negative. Baghdad should not allow it, even at the cost of an armed confrontation.AB: Coming to the question of the moment: the nuclear escalation in North Korean and a possible escalation of war on the Korean peninsula. What is your opinion about Kim s strategy and what are the real risks?AV: There is only one real  risk  and danger: that the world is quickly accepting as inevitable the fact that the Western thuggish regimes can get away with absolutely anything. I see no other serious problem that the world today is facing.What is Kim s strategy? To defend his people by all means, against the brutal force that has already murdered millions of men, women and children of Korea. That brutal force is the West and its allies. It is all very simple, but only if one is willing to turn off the BBC and to use his or her own brain, it becomes  obvious .AB: According to many, for Pyongyang the nuclear bomb is becoming more and more vital because it is increasingly feared that the country will end up like Iraq and Libya. Do you not believe that the sanctions of the United Nations are therefore totally ineffective and counterproductive because they fuel this escalation?AV: Of course, but they [sanctions] are still imposed on the victim! It is because almost no one dares to laugh straight in the faces of Western demagogues and dictators. The world resembles the areas occupied by the Nazi Germany and Italy and Japan during the WWII. There, nobody would dare to vote independently, defending victims of fascism.AB: The US Federation of Science (FAS) estimates that in 2017 North Korea has  fissile material to potentially produce 10 to 20 nuclear warheads  even if it is strongly suspected that none can be considered ready for launch. The US possesses 6,800 nuclear heads. The French and British (respectively 300 and 215 respectively) included, NATO s nuclear forces have 7,315 nuclear warheads, of which 2,200 are ready to launch, compared to 7,000 held by the Russians, of which 1,950 are ready to launch. With Chinese (270), Pakistani (120-130), Indian (110-120) and Israeli (80), the total number of nuclear warheads is estimated to be around 15,000 by default. The West is a nuclear oligopoly that can only create an escalation with those who feel threatened, and so the threatened search to procure them. Is North Korea the only source of nuclear threat to the world, as it seems in the mainstream media?AV: Of course, North Korea is no threat at all. I have already spoken about it during countless televised interviews. I visited North Korea and mingled with its people. There, nobody wants war. The North Korean people paid a terrible price for their independence. Its civilians were murdered mercilessly in tunnels by Western forces; its women were brutally raped, entire villages and towns leveled to the ground, or burned to ashes. All this is never discussed in the West, but is remembered in North Korea.Now, absolutely shameless British propaganda is  preparing  the world public for the  inevitability  of the war. You know, if someone in this day and age still believes that the United States is the only culprit, he or she is perhaps living in some deep isolated trench or a cave. Indoctrination and brainwashing is mainly designed,  Made in Europe , most evidently in the UK, where most of the people have already lost all their ability to think rationally. The British colonialist propaganda apparatus is terribly sinister, but strategically it is simply brilliant! It was utilized for centuries, and it even succeeded in  programming  the brains of the victims in the sub-Continent, Africa and elsewhere.Of course, your numbers are correct and all that is happening is thoroughly absurd! But day and night people are told that North Korea represents a true danger to the world. The same was said about the Soviet Union, China, Cuba, Iraq, Afghanistan and many other countries. Most of these countries have already been destroyed.North Korea s sin is that it refuses to surrender, to fall on its knees, to sacrifice its people. It refuses to become a slave. For centuries, European and later US colonialism punished such defiance in the most brutal ways. Western culture is, after all, based and built on slavery. It demands absolute compliance, unconditional submission.If North Korea is attacked, it should fight back! And it will.AB: The United Nations adopted the important Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in July. The United Nations is often used (in alternate ways and countries): this Treaty is ignored by all nuclear powers, including by members of NATO with US nuclear weapons (including Italy). NATO has banned member states from ratifying it. Can the West have a moralist attitude to those who pursue a deterrent in order not to not end up like Saddam and Gaddafi?AV: The West is like an army of brigands that has managed to overrun some city, to rape everything that moves, burn the center, loot houses and shops and then execute all leading thinkers and defenders. A few days later they see someone stealing a bunch of bananas from a fruit stall. And they catch him, and judge him, and feel totally morally righteous. It is all so comical! But that is not how you are supposed to see it!AB: Russia and China (with Iran, Venezuela and many other countries) are intensifying de-dollarization in their mutual exchanges. Does it envisage a gradual weakening of the dollar capable of affecting international finance and what geopolitical repercussions?AV: Yes, definitely! And you should talk about it to my friend, Peter Koenig, a true dissident, a former economist at the World Bank, who is now actually advising many countries on de-dollarization.US dollars should not be used anymore. Western institutions should be ignored. Totally new structures should be, and are being erected. China and Russia are, of course, in the lead. All this is extremely important and can change the world, in the near future.AB: Venezuela, with the convening of the Constituent Assembly, turned off the coup attempts of the opposition. In Brazil Lula is favored in polls, while in Argentina the former President Cristina Fernandez is back in the Senate with strong popular support. So it was not the end of the progressive cycle, as the mainstream has for years stated?AV: Of course it was not the end! The desire of Lain Americans to live in just and egalitarian societies is too strong; it cannot be destroyed overnight.There were some serious setbacks   in Argentina and Brazil. And Venezuela is suffering immensely, battered by its own shameless elites sponsored from abroad. But the country is still standing.In Brazil, Temer is immensely unpopular. His  constitutional coup  will soon backfire. PT will be back, in its old form or in a new one. And it will be much stronger than before. The same goes for Argentina. You see, despite all the media manipulation, propaganda and shameless lies, people are already realizing that they were fooled. They want some decency back, they want socialism and pride and hope! They want true independence.In two weeks from now I m going back to South America. My book of essays is being published by LOM, soon, and LOM is a very important left-wing publishing house in Chile. These days I go back to South America often. It is one of the frontlines, battlegrounds, where people struggle against Western imperialism and its lackeys!These are very important, fascinating times!

8821, Fox News To Viewers: Key To Winning Jackpot Is Buying As Many Lottery Tickets As You Can Afford,"The same group of people who believed Fox when the network was telling them President Obama was a Kenyan are now rushing to drain their bank accounts for lottery tickets after some characteristically stupid financial advice on Fox and Friends.While Fox was covering the record-breaking $1.4 billion lottery jackpot that has the entire country seeing dollar signs, one of their resident  experts  decided he would share his winning strategy: Spend all of your money on tickets to maximize your chances of winning.At first blush, Fox s expert, Richard Lustig, does sound like he knows what he s talking about. He s won the lottery seven times (at various amounts). His tips, however, are painfully bad. After saying there is no  magic wand  to help a person win the lottery, Lustig says there is one exception: Buy as many tickets as you can afford.In case you needed a reality check, draining your bank account on the off-chance that you win $1.4 billion in the Powerball is not a good idea. While the large pile of cash may seem enticing, the odds that you   specifically you   will be the one who wins it are vanishingly small. (The actual number is around 1 in 292 million.) Buying more tickets only increases your chances by a very small fraction. In all likelihood, you ll simply pay more to still lose.And the Powerball is this large for a reason: the lotto recently became much harder to win. This is no longer the game Lustig used to play, the Powerball has become a bigger mirage than ever. As ThinkProgress explains:In October, the consortium of states that runs Powerball approved a series of rule changed thatmade it much harder to win the jackpot. Under the new rules you select five of 69 numbers, up from five out of 59 numbers. The choices for the Powerball was actually reduced from 35 to 26. Still, this decreased the odds of winning the jackpot from 1 in 175 million to 1 in 292 million.Why would the Powerball do this? Because huge jackpots create a media frenzy that, in turns, gets more people to scramble for lottery tickets. It s a profit-making scheme and it is working.Making matters worse for our hapless Fox News viewers, bigger pots don t make it a better deal for the average lotto player. Mathematicians have worked out that the pot would need to be vastly bigger (about 2.6 billion dollars) to make buying a lottery ticket even worth it statistically.Yikes.The hysteria surrounding the massive powerball jackpot is understandable (who wouldn t want to become an overnight billionaire?), but a respectable news outlet wouldn t run around telling its demonstrably gullible viewers that bankrupting themselves is the best way to become rich. Fox News, yet again, proves that they are much more comfortable operating as a 24-hour swindle operation rather than a responsible media giant with its audience s best interests at heart.Feature image via Media Matters",News,"January 11, 2016"
3161, BREAKING: Senate Republicans Just Passed A Resolution Officially Beginning Obamacare Repeal,"The U.S. Senate has just passed a budget resolution that will officially begin the process of repealing the Affordable Care Act. The measure, which passed 51-48, directs the House to have a repeal bill ready to go by January 27, just one week after Trump takes office.Republican Senator Mike Enzi of Wyoming, who is chairman of the Senate Budget Committee and sponsored the bill, issued a statement on Wednesday afternoon touting the legislation. Today, we take the first steps to repair the nation s broken health care system, removing Washington from the equation and putting control back where it belongs: with patients, their families, and their doctors,  Enzi said.Republicans fell short of the 60 votes necessary to repeal the ACA flat out. But where there s a will there s a way when it comes to the GOP screwing over the American people, so they decided to defund the program through a budget resolution instead, which only needs a majority vote.NPR explains that this  means they can essentially gut the law, removing all the subsidies that help low- and middle-income people buy health insurance and getting rid of the smorgasbord of taxes   on medical devices, insurance companies and wealthy individuals   that pay for those subsidies. Repealing Obamacare will be a complete and total disaster, but that hasn t stopped Republicans from fighting against the healthcare program tooth and nail since the day it passed seven years ago. Yet, in all that time they haven t been able to come up with a plan to replace it and they aren t any closer to one today.The repeal of the ACA will leave as many as 30 million Americans without insurance. For many, such as those with diseases like cancer, multiple sclerosis, lupus, kidney failure, and other serious conditions, this is all but a death sentence. Medicare and Medicaid will also be devastated if the GOP gets their way. But Republicans don t give a damn and never have. They just want to make America sick again to stick it to Obama and don t care who they kill in the process.If you would like to let lawmakers in the House and Senate know just how you feel about this, you can call 202-224-3121.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"January 4, 2017"

A lot. And our economy is booming. We just passed France and India to become, all by ourselves, the world s 6th largest economy.How did California get its act together? Simple, they put Democrats in charge of EVERYTHING: Democrats, from governor on down, control every office and voting body in this state. So we can really study what happens when liberal policies are tried unimpeded. And the only thing I have to say to Republicans about that is: scoreboard, bitches.

Joining the likes of Josh Duggar, Sarah Palin and Kim Davis, Fiorina has committed the ultimate of egregious errors: She worked for a company that profited from fetal stem cell research.In a scathing report from Al Jazeera America, Fiorina was exposed for collecting some $83000 working for a major pharmaceutical company:Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina, a staunch opponent of abortion, made at least $83,000 serving on the board of directors of Merck & Co. at a time when the pharmaceutical company was producing vaccines using fetal stem cell lines derived from aborted fetuses, according to corporate documents reviewed by Al Jazeera America. The program  Inside Story  with Ray Suarez also obtained documents indicating that during Fiorina s tenure on the board, anti-abortion groups had asked Merck to stop producing such vaccines, and that the company had refused.How can someone be so openly  pro-life  and still cash a check earned at least in part by the use of fetal tissue? That s easy: She s a Republican. Republicans live by a different code. All things American should  follow the constitution,  unless it s something they don t like.

22712,CLOAKED IN CONSPIRACY: Overview of JFK Files Reopens Door to Coup d’état Claims & Cold War Era False Flag Terror,"Shawn Helton 21st Century WireSince late October, an ongoing release of intelligence files related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy have reignited decades old conspiracy claims. While the material released is reportedly a mix of new and old, some critics have declared that the recently declassified files reveal even more startling evidence regarding the death of 35th president of the United States.Upon reviewing pivotal historical elements linked to the Kennedy assassination, we re told that the vast majority of CIA and FBI records regarding the JFK files have been released, though many are still pending.Despite claims that newly revealed files contain smoking gun evidence in the enigmatic case, the murder of President John F. Kennedy is perhaps an act that will forever be shrouded in conspiracy and mystery as the controversial case is unlikely to bever e officially reopened during our lifetime.  CLOAKED IN CONSPIRACY    JFK assassination claims have been reignited following the CIA and FBI case record releases. (Photo Illustration 21WIRE s Shawn Helton)NOTE*   While the JFK files have been making their way to The National Archives website since late October, some material released contains names of certain individuals that will remain redacted due to apparent concerns over national security.Although the JFK case is one of America s most compelling conspiracies, it s doubtful that there will ever be complete transparency regarding any information concerning a larger premeditated plot. Among the mountain of theories and credible information concerning the 35th president s assassination, is the likely inclusion of red herrings, false leads, misinformation and media tripwire s that will forever float in the ether of conspiracy realms in an effort to misdirect the public.In the early 1950 s, the CIA ran a cloaked wide-scale program called Operation Mockingbird. The controversial program infiltrated the American news media in order to influence the public, while also disseminating propaganda through various front organizations, magazines and cultural groups.At the start of 2017, more than 12 million declassified documents from the CIA were reportedly published online. While the intelligence docu-dump was believed to have shed additional light on covert war programs, psychic research and the Cold War era, it also contained more evidence confirming the symbiotic relationship between the CIA and American media.

(Image Source: businessinsider)Over the course of this article, we ll take a look at one of America s most puzzling crimes, while examining some of the most intriguing aspects related to the recently declassified JFK files Guarding the Hen HouseAlthough the CIA s declassified JFK documents offer a window into a web of clandestine operatives, cloaked mafia figureheads and uncanny politically connections at play throughout the tension inducing Cold War era, one should remain skeptical and cautious, as it s very unlikely that any new release would result in a criminal case against the producers of such a large conspiratorial crime, even if such a plot revealed irrefutable evidence.  TRIALS & TRIBULATIONS    After Jim Garrison s case against Shaw, the DA was found not guilty on charges of bribery in a separate trial regarding illegal pinball gambling. Garrison represented himself in 3-hour much ballyhooed closing statement and was easily acquitted on all charges. (Image Source: nola)Moreover, while it s tempting to take the claims of the US intelligence apparatus at face value, an astute observer should tread lightly when viewing any new disclosures related to the JFK assassination.In fact, the very institutions releasing these files today, were at the heart of a controversial investigation conducted by New Orleans District Attorney, Jim Garrison, whose CIA related conspiracy claims regarding President Kennedy s assassination led to charges against a well-known New Orleans businessman and former WW2 military intelligence officer named Clay Shaw. After having been decorated with several prestigious military merits without ever having seen fire in the battlefield   Shaw quickly rose through the ranks of the military, even joining the counterintelligence squad known as the Special Operations Section.Shaw s military pedigree recalls the prototype for modern  Deep State intelligence programs and the formation of the Office of the Coordinator of Information (COI), an intelligence propaganda agency in 1941 that was succeeded by Office of Strategic Services (OSS), a wartime intelligence apparatus created in 1942 which focused on psychological warfare prior to the formation of the CIA. OSS agents also worked closely with British Security Coordination (BSC). Additionally, the notorious right-wing paramilitary group Organisation arm e secr te (OAS) in France from 1954-1962 had close ties with the CIA through various front organizations connected to the agency.Below is passage concerning the formation of the CIA as illuminated by Jay Dyer of Jay s Analysis. Here we see that the inception of the CIA was a direct result of the passing of the National Security Act of 1947, as well as the influence of powerful political US-UK think-tanks coordinating in the background: First, the CIA (preceded by the OSS) was set up as a result of the National Security Act of 1947 [signed] under [Harry S. Truman after the OSS creation by] Franklin D. Roosevelt, springing in part from the Pratt House in New York (future home of the Council on Foreign Relations), itself modelled from the British Secret Intelligence Service.  Likewise, the over-arching institutions that control and run the intelligence agencies in the West, like the Council on Foreign Relations, were modelled on the Oxford Round Table Groups and the Royal Institute for International Affairs. Indeed, the Pratt House s British counterpart was the Chatham House. From America to Europe, the spectre of intelligence operations has loomed large throughout much of the last century and in the suspicious death of JFK, this was never more apparent   CONSPIRATOR?    A brooding Clay Shaw photographed during the JFK assassination trial in 1968. (Image Source: nola)Company Men & SpymastersIn the aftermath of WW2, Shaw was stated to have been officially discharged from military duty. This prompted the published playwright and Chevalier of the Order of the Crown in Belgium (Knight of Malta) to then travel to New Orleans, whereupon he supposedly received support from the entrepreneurial millionaire Theodore Brent, a local businessman known for rail and shipping operations, including the Mississippi Shipping Company, an organization believed to be a CIA intelligence front that allegedly focused on gathering information on Latin America. Incidentally, the former OSS intelligence officer Shaw, held his first post-war position with the Mississippi Shipping Company.In 1943, Brent helped charter the International House with a collection of leaders of commerce, trade and banking insiders. It would become one of two predecessors before the creation of the world s first trade center.In 1947, Shaw became a founder and managing director of International Trade Mart, a New Orleans financial partner housed in a 33-story cross-shaped building that played a large role in international commerce. The  Trade Mart  as it was called, merged with the International House to form the World Trade Center (see left photo) of New Orleans in 1968. Upon the apparent  sponsorship  of the trade center, the group sought to expand trade operations in Basel, Switzerland, a project that was backed by a slew of well-connected financiers that brought to fruition the organization known as Permindex. Over the years, many researchers have examined extremely compelling ties between the CIA and Permindex, as one of the holding company s main backers, a lawyer named Lloyd J. Cobb held a Covert Security Clearance issued by the CIA in October of 1953. In addition, Shaw served on the board of directors at Permindex, as Cobb would later become president of Trade Mart in 1962, providing further evidence of the kind of international reach held by the CIA-linked group of partners. Interestingly, one of the Trade Mart s stated goals would not only be to act as a conduit for foreign trade but the organization would also counter communist propaganda.  This is something that would later fall in line with other CIA-linked operations over that time period.Temple University professor and well-known JFK researcher Joan Mellen, found a number of other links between the CIA and the International Trade Mart that aroused suspicion. Here s a short passage from her book entitled  A Farewell to Justice: Jim Garrison, JFK s Assassination, And the Case That Should Have Changed History: The International Trade Mart was run by CIA operatives, its public relations handled by David G. Baldwin, who would later acknowledge his own  CIA connections.  Baldwin s successor, Jesse Core, was also with the CIA. It was a matter of saving the Agency  shoe leather,  Core would say. The Trade Mart donated money to CIA asset Ed Butler s INCA. Every consulate within its bowels was bugged. Furthermore, not only were Trade Mart and Permindex linked to the CIA   but (see left photo) they were also suspected of ties to organized crime.In March of 1967, according to the Italian newspaper Paese Sera, Permindex was said to have been CIA front for the purposes of political espionage in Europe, including claims that the company took part in an attempted assassination on the French Prime Minister Charles de Gualle alongside the extremist French group OAS in 1961. There were some 30 attempts on de Gaulle s life in the early 1960 s, which many believe was linked to him granting Algeria independence. In 1966, de Gaulle also bucked the established order by withdrawing France from the NATO Military Command Structure. In 1958, after the inception of Permindex, Shaw, along with Cobb and other banking and trade insiders, including David Rockefeller, created a Permindex subsidiary in Rome known as Centro Mondaiale Commerciale (CMC). Permindex/CMC, were later kicked out of Italy due to implications that the CIA front organizations were involved in the subversion of European governments.After Shaw s arrest, Joan Mellen s husband Ralph Schoenman sent the Paese Sera newspaper articles to Garrison from London. The Italian paper according to Mellen, exposed the  CIA s pernicious attempt to influence European electoral politics and thwart the democratic process in more than one country. Adding to that, Mellen explained in her book mentioned above, that the family of former CIA Director of Central Intelligence, Allen Dulles (left photo), had been very  interested  in Permindex.  In 2005, Dr. Daniele Ganser stated that a highly secretive CIA-backed paramilitary army was  born out of the head of Allen Dulles  in his seminal book,  NATO s Secret Armies: Operation Gladio and Terrorism in Western Europe.  According Ganser s research, documents revealed that the CIA s covert armies were used to subvert the political interests of various nations through the implementation of a Cold-War era strategy of tension. As the former Swiss Director of the OSS, Dulles, had a tainted past tied to a program which sought to assimilate Nazi scientists into America after WW2 under the code name Operation Paperclip. A decade later in 1953, Dulles as head of the CIA approved $1 million dollars in the lead up to overthrow the democratically elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh in what became known as Operation Ajax (aka the TPAJAX project). One year later, in 1954, he was the mastermind of a Guatemalan coup.In the aftermath of the JFK assassination, Dulles would be appointed as one of a seven member panel on the controversial Warren Commission headed by fellow Freemason Chief Justice Earl Warren. Rather intriguingly, David Talbot s book entitled  The Devil s Chessboard: Allen Dulles, the CIA, and the Rise of America s Secret Government,  recently raised more questions concerning the potential role played by Dulles in the death of Kennedy.During the Dulles era as CIA chief, Shaw s served as an informant in the CIA s Domestic Contacts Service throughout 1948-1956. Given Shaw s extensive military intelligence background, it stands to reason any connection to the CIA would have been extremely significant.Prior to the formation of the top-secret project QKENCHANT in 1952, Shaw was granted a  five-agency  clearance in 1949. According to FOIA documents obtained by the Mary Ferrell Foundation,  Subject [Shaw] was granted a Provisional Security Approval for use under Project QKENCHANT on an unwitting basis on 10 December 1962.  The  Agency project QKENCHANT was allegedly used to grant security approvals to  non-Agency personnel,  along with closely tied entities for the purpose of proposing future projects, activities and the formation of new relationships. Interestingly, project QKENCHANT also used the services of another individual swirling in the JFK assassination stratosphere named E. Howard Hunt. Years later, the former CIA operative and White House aide Hunt, would become a well-known name as he was tagged as one of five Watergate burglars that stained the Nixon administration after breaking into the Democratic National Committee headquarters. The list of additional accomplices included three other apparent anti-communist Cuban exiles, along with G. Gordon Liddy, and James McCord who would also be implicated in the  White House Plumbers  plot.In 2007, although Hunt declined direct participation, he released a 2004 controversial confession that suggested he played a  benchwarmer  role in the plot to kill Kennedy. While Hunt s apparent allegations caused quite a stir, he fingered several suspected plotters such as the anti-Castro Frank Sturgis and Cuban exile leader of Alpha 66, Antonio Veciana, a man who claims to have  inadvertently  witnessed a meeting with the CIA and Lee Harvey Oswald before Kennedy s death.In Michael Benson s  Who s Who in the JFK Assassination: An A to Z Encyclopedia,  according to Garrison, CMC represented the paramilitary right in Europe, along with the  Italian fascists, American CIA and other interests.  Here s a compelling passage from Benson s book that links CMC, Permindex, the CIA and organized crime: According to evidence in the WC [Warren Commission] hearings, Permindex was suspected of funding political assassinations and laundering money for organized crime. Shaw was also on the board of directors for Permindex s sister corporation, Centro Mondaiale Commerciale CMC.Benson s book also cites other well researched claims regarding CMC and the apparent money laundering of their liquid assets. According to a 1958 State Department document, the CMC, the World Trade Center of Rome, was indeed modeled after the CIA-created Trade Mart in New Orleans.More recently, important  groundbreaking  documents associated with the construct of CMC were unearthed in 2016 by the Italian journalist Michele Metta.According to well-known researcher and writer Jim Marrs a tangled web of intelligence operations linked to Permindex and CMC were further described in his book entitled  Cross Fire: The Plot That Killed Kennedy. Below is a revealing passage from the seminal JFK researcher: The Trade Mart was connected with the Centro Mondaiale Commerciale CMC through yet another shadowy firm named Permindex (Permanent Industrial Expositions), also in the business of international expositions. Continuing, Cross Fire exposed other suspicious intelligence links: The Italian media reported that [Ferenc] Nagy was president of Permindex and the board chairman and major stockholder was Major Louis Mortimer Bloomfield a powerful Montreal lawyer who represented the Bronfmans, a Canadian family made wealthy by the liquor industry, as well as serving US intelligence services. Reportedly Bloomfield established Permindex in 1958 as part of the creation of worldwide trade centers connected with CMC. As reported in investigative work by David Goldman and Jeffery Steinberg in 1981, Bloomfield was stated to have been recruited to be part of the British Special Operations Executive (SOE) in 1938. later the Montreal lawyer obtained an official rank in the US Army, OSS intelligence and the FBI s counterespionage  Division Five  unit as confirmed by Marrs. Additionally, Bloomfield held close ties with Master Mason FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover and Tibor Rosenbaum, a head of finance for Israeli intelligence.Further conspiratorial claims would be levied on Rosenbaum s Geneva-based Banque de Credit International (BCI), a Mossad-linked bank that allegedly laundered Permindex money to finance assassination attempts on de Gaulle. BCI was also the predecessor to the scandal plagued Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) that was later found to be peddling in terror funding, arms deals and prostitution. BCCI would later be implicated in the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee report called The BCCI Affair. In 1974, Rosenbaum himself was said to have owed BCI some $60 million after his business associate Baron Edmond de Rothschild of the Israel Corporation, discovered an apparent an open and shut case of unauthorized conversion of company funds,  that were transferred to the insolvent Inter Credit Trust of Vaduz instead of BCI.

(Image Source: neworleanspast)The Dallas Plot & The Cuban ProjectIn March of 1967, Garrison, the ex-FBI agent turned DA, indicted Shaw on conspiracy charges related to the assassination of President Kennedy. It would take 22 months before the court proceedings would begin in a trial which lasted 34 days. Aspects of the Shaw trial became popularized following Oliver Stone s much debated and controversial thriller entitled JFK (1991).At the start of the trial in 1969, Garrison s opening statement contended that Shaw, a man believed to have used the alias known as  Clay Bertrand  (also Clem) within the New Orleans socialite scene and gay underground, was also a well-connected former military intelligence officer with no formal background in trade that allegedly participated in a plot to kill the 35th president of the United States. Garrison would further assert that Shaw met with a former US Marine Lee Harvey Oswald and an airline pilot for Eastern Airlines, David Ferrie on several occasions over the summer of 1963, eventually culminated in a meeting at Ferrie s New Orleans apartment where Garrison s star-witness a 25-year-old insurance salesman for Equitable Life Assurance Society named Perry Raymond Russo, apparently overheard the men discussing critical details regarding a JFK assassination plot in September of 1963.Below is screen shot depicting a portion of a NY Times article discussing Russo s testimony of the JFK plot Russo s account of what happened was a major part of the trial and has been one of the most controversial aspects of Garrison s case against Shaw ever since. Over the years, researchers and mainstream critics have debated the credibility of Russo after receiving hypnosis prior to his testimony.JFK case critics believe that due to the combination of the credibility of witnesses called into question, the possibility of planted witnesses and the untimely deaths of some 18 material witnesses, including the controversial death of Ferrie, who was not able to be deposed, Shaw was acquitted in 54 minutes in the only JFK assassination case to make it to trial.A documentary entitled  The JFK Assassination; The Jim Garrison Tapes  discusses many of the  controversial elements of the Shaw trial and its aftermath Interestingly, the demanding trial would include some surprising moments based on witness testimony, as well as the shocking Abraham Zapruder footage which was viewed publicly for the first time before the jury. Moreover, it would later be revealed that the apparent dressmaker Zapruder, had his own links to a CIA front organization as he was stated to have been a member of the Dallas Council on World Affairs. Another fellow member of the council orbiting around the JFK plot, was petroleum engineer George Serguis de Mohrenschildt. Mohrenschildt s ties didn t end there, as he apparently worked out of a CIA-trust building and had befriended Oswald in the summer of 1962. It would later be revealed that Mohrenschildt exchanged letters with Texas oilman and Vice President Lyndon Baines Johnson (LBJ) some seven months before the JFK assassination and that he knew George Bush Sr since 1942. Surely, these high level links to CIA and top-ranking officials tracing back to Oswald were not just a coincidence. The whole episode appears to have been echoed two decades later, as a Bush/Hinckley family nexus was exposed following an attempt to assassinate the 40th President of the United States, Ronald Reagan.While many mainstream accounts support a Fidel Castro theory in the death of Kennedy due to the apparent assassination attempts on his life, its important to note the massive CIA influence in Cuba. According to Cuban-born American historian and writer Servando Gonzalez, Castro himself had ties to the Council on Foreign Relations and was really a form of controlled opposition. Furthermore, when concerning a larger conspiracy revolving around Cuba, one should consider the political backdrop   on one hand there was the possibly designed to fail CIA-backed  Bay of Pigs  invasion which set the stage for Operation Mongoose, a clandestine program overseen by the CIA, the US State Department (DOS) and the Department of Defense (DoD). Mongoose made use of the anti-Castro Oswald-CIA-mafia-linked Ferrie, along with Cuban exiles in order to sabotage the Castro regime. Additionally, waiting in the wings was the top-secret proposal called Operation Northwoods, a particularly subversive false flag program that included plots of hijacked planes, the bombing of a US ship, a virulent communist Cuban terror campaign in US cities and manufacturing the  real or simulated  deaths of Cuban refugees.In April of 1961, US planning for the Cuban Project aka Operation Mongoose began and was to stated to have been led by Air Force General Edward Lansdale, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and others. The all-encompassing covert war program (seen in part in the image below) would be set in motion to subvert the Cuban regime by October 1962. Underneath the network of Operation Mongoose, there were 33 proposed plans (including Operation Northwoods) designed specifically to be used as a pretext to invade Cuba.The Northwoods false flag operation drafted by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and signed off on by Chairman Lyman Lemnitzer was ultimately rejected by Kennedy. However, the declassified files related to the operation are still shocking 55 years later, as the program considered creating  funerals for mock victims, for one of the various plots, as well as produce  casualty lists in US newspapers,  in order to  cause a helpful wave of indignation,  as another plot would reveal where  Soviet bloc incendiaries could be found, after a night of cane-burning in Cuba.This was all said to be happening as President Kennedy was stated to have quietly been working to negotiate through  back channels  with Castro. October of 1962 ushered in the  Cuban Missile Crisis a tense escalation during the Cold War that culminated in Soviet nuclear missiles being placed in Cuba to prevent an invasion. During this time, all Mongoose related operations were halted, as US intelligence apparently failed to warn the Kennedy administration of the Soviet military aid.One could contend that the entirety of Mongoose PSYOP used to cast blame on Cuba was a precursor for future nation building projects that have also unfairly manipulated the public in the wake of alleged mass trauma.  PATSY?    Many researchers believe that the alleged lone gunman in the JFK assassination was an intelligence linked operative who used the alias, Alek Hidell.  (Image Source: pinterest)Covert Operators, the Mafia & NATO s False FlagsAs the identity of Oswald has been shrouded in mystery and manipulation, one is reminded of his  Fair Play for Cuba Committee housed at 544 Camp Street in the very same building of Guy Banister, ex-FBI agent turned private investigator, whose office was at 531 Lafayette Street, just around the corner from Oswald s office in the now demolished Newman building. Incidentally, Banister was stated to have been linked to the FBI s Hoover, while maintaining a front investigative firm that included the CIA operative Ferrie, who reportedly had very close ties to one of the country s most powerful mafia bosses, Carlos Marcello of New Orleans. According to a Washington Post article from 1979, the House Select Committee on Assassinations believed that Banister s private detective agency was a cover for his role as go-between for the CIA and the Cuban exiles involved in anti-Castro operations.  Additionally, Banister and Ferrie were reportedly engaged in a gun-running operation for Cuban commandos, as the building became headquarters for anti-Castro groups. A decade after the assassination and Shaw trial, CIA operative William Gaudet claimed to have seen Banister with Oswald in a garage near the Camp Street offices. Banister was also found to have ties to the extremist French group OAS.Interestingly, both Oswald and Ferrie operated offices out of the 544 Camp Street address. This meant that the apparently pro-Castro Oswald group operated directly next to Ferrie s anti-Castro activities. The absurdity of this revelation is still as potent today as it was in the late 1960 s. Furthermore, the Post article mentioned above, explained that  Banister s Camp Street office was surrounded by Cuban-exile organizations, including at one point the Cuban Revolutionary Council, a CIA front group set up by, among others, Antonio de Varona, the Cuban exile leader. Rather intriguingly, the Warren Commission would conclude that no one could connect Oswald to 544 Camp Street. This would directly contradict the FBI s own pre-assassination file which had already conclusively linked Oswald to the well-known Camp Street address.Even though allegedly avowed Marxist Oswald operated the pro-Castro  Fair Play for Cuba Committee, the group was later suspected to be an intelligence  cover  designed to further the pursuits of the anti-Castro movement. This something which fell in line with the  rabidly anti-Communist,  CIA-linked Ferrie, a person with a sordid past and lengthy history of sexual abuse from his time in priesthood as well as aeronautics.It was later publicly acknowledged that Ferrie first met Oswald while instructing a small squadron at Moisant Airport from June to September 1955. This contradicted Ferrie, who denied knowing Oswald after the Kennedy assassination. The 15-year-old Oswald joined Ferrie s squadron on July 27, 1955.  COLLABORATORS?    The Lee Harvey Oswald and David Ferrie seen together with a flight squad at Moisant Airport. (Image source: meandlee)NATO s paramilitary-style stay-behind-armies are stated to have been comprised the CIA-linked Operation GLADIO. The origins of GLADIO have been well documented and the secretive counterintelligence operation has been linked to a wave of right-wing  false flag  terror attacks across Europe throughout the 1950 s into the 1980 s. The anti-communist organizational designs were directly connected to that of the CIA and MI6 in particular, with the US and British special forces reportedly facilitating the training.QUESTION: Did Permindex/CMC, along with NATO intelligence, also play a part in facilitating the efforts of Operation GLADIO?When you consider the time frame of  Stay Behind  operations already in existence since 1952, it seems likely that the CIA would make use of its various front organizations to supply the means to produce such covert operations. This is further bolstered by the fact that in 1956, the same year Permindex became operational in Switzerland, Prime Minister of Hungary Ferenc Nagy, who is documented to have been a CIA asset, had gone to Germany and Switzerland on the heels of the apparently CIA influenced Hungarian Revolution. It s worth noting that Nagy was also said to have served on the board of directors at Permindex.According to noted writer and researcher Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, a former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Economic Policy under Ronald Reagan s administration, JFK was unaware of the CIA-NATO terror related activities of Operation GLADIO. Here s a passage from that report by Roberts below: President John F. Kennedy had experienced in the Joint Chiefs of Staff under Chairman Lyman Lemnitzer a high level of insubordination. Lemnitzer showed in White House meetings contempt for the president. When Lemnitzer brought Kennedy the Northwoods Project to shoot down American citizens in the streets of America and to blow American airliners out of the sky in order to place the blame on Castro so that the US could invade and achieve  regime change,  a popular term of the George W. Bush regime, in Cuba, President Kennedy removed Lemnitzer as chairman and sent him to Europe as head of NATO.Kennedy did not know about Operation Gladio, an assassination program in Europe run by NATO and the CIA. Communists were blamed for Operation Gladio s bombings of civilians in train stations in order to erode communist political influence, especially in Italy. Thus, Kennedy s way of getting rid of Lemnitzer put Lemnitzer in charge of this program and gave Lemnitzer a way to get rid of John Kennedy. The article also provides a plausible explanation for the assassination of JFK s brother Robert after he won the Democratic party primary in California in June of 1968. It appears according to Roberts, that RFK might have known about the assassins interwoven into the fabric of the intelligence-crime syndicate shaped and organized by military-linked men, those in high level security operations and those connected to the mafia that played a role in JFK s death. Roberts suggests that RFK was seeking higher office to potentially hold those involved accountable for their crimes against America and his brother, the 35th president of the United States.From this, we can view global operations like GLADIO in addition to the post-9/11  War On Terror  security surge as a form of  power politics  used to aggressively influence the foreign policy of other nations through the use of covert militarization.Lets take a look at some of the records related to the latest CIA and FBI releases in 2017 worth examining in one of the most notorious crimes of the 20th century Below is a screen capture of one CIA document that discussed a dinner sponsored by Oren Fenton Potito, an individual listed as a President of the Eastern Synod of Christian Identity and an organizer of the National States  Rights Party (NSRP), who also happened to be a member of the Klu Klux Klan (KKK). In the now declassified document, Potito acknowledged an association between Lee Harvey Oswald and a man identified as Ruby, formally Rubenstein, otherwise known Jack Ruby. Interestingly, both Oswald and Ruby had ties to the Marcello crime family.Another revelation in the memo below added to already existing expert testimony concerning the probability of multiple shooters on November 22nd, 1963 It s worth noting that both NSRP and the KKK were both heavily infiltrated by the FBI s COINTELPRO program, a counter-intelligence program that was specifically designed to influence, disrupt, coerce and discredit political factions from the inside out. The secretive FBI program infiltrated both left and right-wing political groups across America from 1956-1971. Moreover, the controversial program influenced, radicalized and neutralized political dissidents through the use of divisive tactics such as Bad-Jacketing, a technique which manufactured false evidence, fear and rumors regarding various activists. Since NSRP and the KKK were FBI infiltrated groups, it is much more likely that anyone associated with Potito would have already been well-known to authorities.In essence, the document pictured above provides more evidence that Oswald was in reality a known wolf   one who is still without a clear motive in the crime of which he was accused.In October of 2017, another controversial nugget in the JFK files was a memo written by FBI Director Hoover after Oswald was shot by Ruby. The memo revealed that the head of FBI was concerned that the bureau needed to  convince  the public that Oswald acted alone in the Kennedy assassination. A portion of Hoover s memo read The thing I am concerned about, and so is Mr. Katzenbach, is having something issued so we can convince the public that Oswald is the real assassin. Other intriguing aspects included in the recent releases concerned the informant status of Dallas police officer J.D Tippit and his alleged involvement in the Kennedy assassination as a trigger man. According to the official narrative Tippit was shot by Oswald 45 minutes after Kennedy s homicide, but the newly circulated memo states that Tippit met with Oswald and Ruby at a nightclub a week prior to the shooting.An additional memo released suggested that the UK s Cambridge News received a warning call 25 minutes prior to JFK s death. This information was written in a memo by then FBI Deputy Director James Angleton to Hoover. However, since this story was made public in late October, Cambridge News has denied  that the tip-off ever occurred. Other JFK file details suggest a US plan to create a false flag scenario using Soviet planes to carry out attacks.In Summary There s been a host of characters and Deep State actors that have an uncanny connection surrounding a swirling conspiracy in JFK s death and this article covers only a fraction of the overwhelming intelligence backdrop associated with the case, not to mention the highly suspicious forensic elements involved in the shooting itself. While varying theories in the JFK murder plot have implicated everyone from the CIA to the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), to lurking spymasters, crime bosses and oil barons to pro-Castro Cubans, to Cuban exiles and trade executives   one thing is clear, due to its own compromising alliances, elements within the US government deliberately stonewalled convincing and credible information prudent to the American people regarding the now mythic case.Moreover, the symbolic nature of JFK s violent end, along with the establishment s masking of Oswald s intelligence links to high-ranking officials and other syndicate members perpetually forces the American to people to relive the ritualistic trauma of that dark November day on a time loop without any true resolution.The further one digs into America s seedy underworld of organized crime, intelligence operations, unlikely coincidences and covert relationships concerning the mysterious plot to kill Kennedy, a highly intricate web of activity emerges that points to a compelling case beyond almost any other modern-day conspiracy.*** 21WIRE associate editor Shawn Helton is a researcher and writer, specializing in forensic analysis of high-profile crime scene and counter terrorism investigations, and the deconstruction and analysis of the mass-media coverage surrounding those cases.

The video can be seen HERE.One of the organizers of the  Deploraball,  Mike Chernovich is a conservative author, activist and is very active on Twitter. Here is an excerpt from his video below: When you go on video and you admit to committing an act of domestic terrorism, and then you buy tickets, that is an overt act. It s a criminal conspiracy to commit an act of terrorism.  And they definitely picked the wrong group to try and terrorize. Jeff Sessions is gonna be the Attorney General. This is a new Department of Justice. They thought they were dealing with Obama. Because Obama would let it go. Obama would say  Oh terrorism against these people, who cares?  Well Obama isn t in charge of the Department of Justice anymore. Obama, Eric Holder, Loretta Lynch they re out. This afternoon DeploraBall organizer Mike Cernovich announced plans to file terrorism charges against the DisruptJ20 leftist group.Mike Cernovich said the FBI was contacted and the DeploraBall is going to file civil charges.Mike Cernovich:  They picked the wrong people to threaten with terrorism.

2293, GOP Rep Asks Muslim High School Students: ‘Do You Beat Your Wife?’ (VIDEO),"A GOP lawmaker in Oklahoma raised more than a few eyebrows when before speaking to a group of Muslim high school students, he presented them with a questionnaire that represented the worst about Islamophobia. He even asked them,  Do you beat your wife? In Oklahoma, there s an annual Muslim Day at the Capitol, which is hosted by the Council on American-Islamic Relations. Students from Tulsa s private school for Muslims called the Peace Academy wanted to visit the office of Rep. John Bennett, but before he would meet with them, they were supposed to fill out a questionnaire from a hate group.That s according to Adam Soltani, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations of Oklahoma, who posted a video to Facebook shortly after the incident occurred Thursday. I just have been informed by some of our community members that Rep. John Bennett   who in my opinion, at this point, doesn t even deserve to be called a representative   is refusing to meet with Muslims unless they answer questions from an Islamophobic hate group called Act For America,  Soltani said in the video.Source: Huffington PostHere s some of the questionnaire:Here s the video by Adam Soltani:Bennett hasn t responded, but even beyond the fact that this is a bigoted questionnaire, this was directed at high school students!While it s tempting to blame this on Donald Trump, the hate enabler, Bennett has been on the hate train for quite a while. In 2014, he denied that there were moderate Muslims and said that 90 percent of Islam is violent.Here s that video:Bennett, it seems, should be reminded that the vast majority of victims of terrorists are themselves Muslim. In this country, Muslims are far more likely to be victims of terrorism (hate crimes) than to initiate terrorism, but we ll never hear that from the occupant of the White House. Instead, Republicans will just spread the idea that high school students might beat their wives.Featured image via video screen capture",News,"March 4, 2017"
12377,Meet The LEFTIST Assistant Professor Who Made Up Bogus List Of “Fake” Conservative Websites That Went Viral,"Approximately one year ago, my business partner sent me a screen shot of a list of  phony  or  not to be trusted  websites  that was going around Facebook. Our website (100percentfedup.com), along with several other conservative websites like Breitbart, IJ Review, Infowars, Biz Pac Review and The Blaze were included on this list. Most of the websites listed had a considerable amount of traffic and cumulatively reach hundreds of millions of readers. I told her to ignore it, that it was clearly created by some leftist organization who was trying to discredit conservative websites. One year later, a list that has striking similarities has been revived. This time however, the list has been amended to include ONE liberal website,  Occupy Democrats  and has a new author, Melissa Zimdars. After all, a list of 90  phony  or  misleading  websites wouldn t be legitimate if at least one of them wasn t a liberal site right?While some of the websites on the list are fake and should be called out as such, there are WAY more legitimate conservative sites on this list who work very hard to vet their sources and to bring their readers truthful news they won t find in the mainstream media. After the election results came in, many on the Left were inconsolable and were lashing out at conservative news sites as the reason Hillary lost. It didn t take long for the Left to realize they had finally met their match with driven conservatives who were not going to roll over and let the Left drive the narrative this time around. Thus the list by Leftist activist Melissa Zimdars, that is being used to discredit many of us who take our jobs very seriously, and are doing all that we can to fight back against a biased media complex.We were curious about Melissa and her political leanings. Could this list have anything to do with wanting to  pay back  the sites who helped to topple Hillary? We did a little research on Melissa and found that her Twitter account is on lock-down. We found this to be slightly ironic considering she appears to be all about transparency. Thanks to Way Back Time Machine, we were able to find out a little bit about Melissa:Melissa is a follower of The Radical  Chicago Rising  and  The End Of Protest  who describes their group as  A new playbook for revolution by Micah White, co-creator of Occupy Wall Street: Melissa is big fan of Black Lives Matter, and was helping to promote the BLM march that threatened the safety and security of many innocent people in Chicago:Here s the real reason why Zimdar likely has her Twitter account on lockdown. She wouldn t want to let everyone know she just published a list of conservative sites that she suggests,  should never be trusted  and allow her hatred for Donald Trump to be exposed at the same time. Besides her hatred for Trump and Karl Rove (see below), she apparently gets  goosebumps  when she hears Bernie Sanders  name. I know what you re thinking She s sounding more  objective  all the time right?Melissa retweeted Hillary s angry tweet about Trump:She s no fan of Dr. Ben Carson and his belief that the government shouldn t be able to force employers to pay an arbitrary minimum wage:Melissa s story became popular after she posted it to her Facebook page, which should come as no surprise given the  friends  who are actively suggesting names of other conservative sites they detest that  Melissa needs to add to the her list. Even though Breitbart is on her  list , Zimdar s friend asks her,  Where s Brietbart? Other friends want to know how they can submit conservative sites that can be added to her list:And of course, what kind of conservative media  hit list  would be complete without Fox News? This friend suggests she needs to put FOX News at the  top  of the list:This Hillary supporter tells Zimdar she d like to use this list as a teaching tool in her class:Just another liberal agitator who plans to use this list to teach her students about honest journalism.Here is Zimdar admitting that not every site is always unreliable, that some,  waffle back and forth . But what the heck she ll leave them there anyhow: ",politics,"Nov 16, 2016"
6567, City Of Detroit Begins Punishing Poor People For Being Poor In The Most Inhumane Way (VIDEO),"Imagine your child was playing outside, runs into the house for a drink, turns on the tap and nothing comes out. Your baby is standing there sweating and thirsty all because the city you live in has decided that your family deserved to be punished for being poor and shut your water off. When you realize what has happened, you send your child to your neighbor s house to get a glass of water there, but their water has been shut off too, and thousands of other people in the city are facing the same dilemma. Elderly people, families with children, young couples, students, all without water   that s what s happening in Detroit, Michigan.Roughly 20,000 people are in danger of having their water turned off today, according to Detroit s ABC 7 News:The water is still on for Detroit residents behind on their bills, but not for long. Detroit Water and Sewerage announced they re shutting off service to those who owe them payments. About 20,000 people could see their water shut off, starting May 3rd at 8 a.m.Since 2014, the people of one of the poorest cities in the country have been fighting to keep their water on. The Detroit Water Crisis is so bad that experts from the United Nations have accused the city of violating human rights. In June 2014, the group put out a press release saying: Disconnection of water services because of failure to pay due to lack of means constitutes a violation of the human right to water and other international human rights Disconnections due to non-payment are only permissible if it can be shown that the resident is able to pay but is not paying. In other words, when there is genuine inability to pay, human rights simply forbids disconnections. Nearly two years later the fight over water is still going on and city officials are claiming that they don t  want  to turn the services off, but they have to if residents do not ask to be put on payment plans. Detroit Water and Sewerage Director Gary Brown said, We don t want to shut anyone s water off. Come in, ask for assistance, get on a payment plan.  Residents who have bills of up to $700 will have the balance frozen and be allowed to pay $25 a month.While it may seem like a sweet payment plan, clearly it is not working. In the two years since the city started to aggressively target residents who could not pay, they still have thousands of residents in the same situation. These are not people who are refusing to pay their water bills because they want to go out and party; these are people who live in extreme poverty   the likes of which should not exist in this country.It is incredibly inhumane for the city to do this. Water is a right, not a luxury and it should NEVER be shut off because someone cannot afford to pay. But capitalism   isn t it great?For more on Detroit s water wars, watch this video:Featured image via Bill Pugliano/Getty Images",News,"May 3, 2016"
17098,Executive Order: Obama Orders Behavioral Experiments On Americans,"If you think this is a good idea then you might be a leftist. Our government wants to nudge us to do what they want.President Obama announced a new executive order on Tuesday which authorizes federal agencies to conduct behavioral experiments on U.S. citizens in order to advance government initiatives.In its 2013 memo, which was reported by Fox News at the time, the White House openly admitted that the initiative involved behavioral experimentation.The initiative draws on research from University of Chicago economist Richard Thaler and Harvard law school professor Cass Sunstein, who was also dubbed Obama s regulatory czar. The two behavioral scientists argued in their 2008 book  Nudge  that government policies can be designed in a way that  nudges  citizens towards certain behaviors and choices.Read more: Daily Caller",Government News,"Sep 15, 2015"
21219,CHURCH REPLACES JESUS In Nativity Scene With Drowned Muslim Syrian Boy,"Because the tragic drowning of this Muslim Syrian boy (who was not really facing persecution) is apparently infinitely more important to the Left than celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ. But we already knew that Worse yet, is the fact that the family of the boy who drowned was not even escaping persecution. Unfortunately, the mainstream media neglected to tell the world that the boy s father was coming to Europe to get his teeth fixed. Click HERE for entire story. A church in Madrid has decided to recreate the nativity scene using the image of drowned Syrian child Aylan Kurdi to highlight the plight of migrants.The photo of the drowned toddler went viral in September, and as Breitbart London reported yesterday, helped change the tone of the debate around Europe s ongoing migrant crisis in favour of the  refugees  trope.Now The Local reports that a group called  Mensajeros de la Paz  (Messengers of Peace) have incorporated the image into a nativity scene at the San Anton church in the Chueca district of Madrid.The church already has an ultra-liberal reputation, allowing pets to attend Mass and streaming live-feeds on huge widescreen TVs. The faithful can also go to Confession via an iPad app.In the nativity scene, Aylan takes the place of the baby Jesus while his parents act as Mary and Joseph. The stable becomes a refugee tent, while the floor is a map of Europe with the main routes taken by migrants.It was designed by Spanish artist Ikella Alonso for Messengers of Peace, a charity founded by priest  ngel Garc a Rodr guez in 1962 that has been dealing with the migrant crisis.The image has appeared throughout the media since September. Speaking on the its effectiveness, Dr Claire Wardle, research director at the Tow Centre for Digital Journalism at Colombia University, said:  2015 was the year the Syrian refugee crisis hit the European consciousness, but it s easy to forget that this was not the case before the Aylan Kurdi image. In April, over 700 refugees and migrants lost their lives when their boat capsized off Lampedusa. After one day of coverage, the story disappeared, despite the tragic loss of life. The photo of Aylan Kurdi galvanised the public in a way that hours of broadcasts and thousands of column inches wasn t able to do. It has created a frame through which subsequent coverage has been positioned and compared.  Via: Breitbart News",left-news,"Dec 16, 2015"
8527, Stephen Colbert Gets Donald Rumsfeld To Admit The Iraq War Was All A Lie (VIDEO),"Donald Rumsfeld is in full damage control mode after a declassified memo from 2002 making the rounds revealed that he lied about Iraq s  WMDs.  Like anyone desperate to sway public opinion and keep himself out of jail, Rumsfeld is giving interviews to tell  his side.  Why he decided to go The Late Show with Stephen Colbert is unclear. Colbert is a screaming liberal, very smart and very well-informed. Perhaps Rumsfeld thought he could outmaneuver the comedian? Maybe he thought Colbert would go easy on him? Maybe Rumsfeld is suffering from dementia?Needless to say, the interview did not go well for Rumsfeld:The talk show host said this showed Bush administration officials believed there were weapons of mass destruction   but they had no hard evidence of their existence. I believe that sincerely   I don t think anybody made up the belief that there were weapons of mass destruction,  Colbert said, as Rumsfeld insisted those beliefs were sincere.  That is cynicism beyond what I would ever want to think of my government. I believe that everybody believed that they were there, but there was no hard proof that they were there,  he continued.  And yet it was presented to the American people as if there was. So there was an unknown known for the American people. It was known that there was not hard evidence, but we were presented a partial picture   and that s the unknown known that we were denied. Do you think that was the right thing to do? In this, Colbert is far nicer than I would have been. We already know that Bush and his neo-con administration wanted an excuse to invade Iraq. In the immediate aftermath of 9/11, Bush demanded that the intelligence community  find  a connection between Iraq and the attacks. When they couldn t find a connection, one was manufactured for the sole purpose of selling the American people on the war. In this  known known  context, it takes very little to imagine Bush, Cheney and Rumsfeld fabricating their  belief  in WMDs from whole cloth.But the best moment came when Colbert got Rumsfeld to admit, out loud, that the utter certainty about WMDs that we were sold was, in fact, total bullshit: Were there things that the administration or you knew that we didn t learn about out of the best possible intentions   which is, there were things that would undermine the case for a war you thought was necessary to save the United States,  Colbert said.At last, Rumsfeld delivered a straight answer. The president had available to him intelligence from all elements of the government, and the National Security Council members had that information,  Rumsfeld said.  It was all shared, it was all supplied, and it s never certain  if it were a fact, it wouldn t be called intelligence. Translation into non-weasel speak: We lied when we said we  knew  for a fact that the WMDs existed.If you ll recall, the made up connection to 9/11 and WMDs were the entire basis for the Iraq War and Rumsfeld just admitted they lied about them.For the revisionists out there, a quick history lesson. Rumsfeld didn t say he  thought  Iraq had WMDs. Or that we were pretty sure or even very confident. He didn t equivocate in the slightest. He said we knew where they were. STEPHANOPOULOS: And is it curious to you that given how much control U.S. and coalition forces now have in the country, they haven t found any weapons of mass destruction?SEC. RUMSFELD:  We know where they are. They re in the area around Tikrit and Baghdad and east, west, south and north somewhat.-ABC s This Week, 3/30/03If the American people had been told that our intelligence on WMDs was as shaky as it actually was, no one but the most bloodthirsty among us would have supported it. Americans are more than happy to bomb people that attack us or a friend, but preemptive war is not, and has never been, a part of our DNA. Rumsfeld and his co-conspirators knew this so they lied through their teeth. It took a comedian to finally get one of the blood-soaked architects of America s worst war since Vietnam to admit it.Bravo, Mr. Colbert!

1488, McConnell Says He’ll Obstruct ANY Effort To Hire Independent Special Prosecutor,"Siding with Trump s Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Trump s spokesperson, McConnell told America from the floor of the Senate that he sees no reason to assign an independent special prosecutor or create a bipartisan committee to get to the bottom of Trump s relationship to Russia.JUST NOW: McConnell says new investigation will only impede current work on Russia investigations.(so no special prosecutor or committee)  John Berman (@JohnBerman) May 10, 2017McConnell was rebuffing Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer s renewed call for an independent investigator. I have said from the get-go that I think a special prosecutor is the way to go, but now with what s happened it is the only way to go,  Schumer told reporters on Tuesday.Instead, McConnell said he would leave that up to the FBI   and let Jeff Sessions handpick Comey s  interim  (read: non-confirmed) FBI head, something that is not standard procedure.News: AG Sessions & Deputy AG Rosenstein interviewing potential interim FBI directors today, according to a DOJ official (@LauraAJarrett)  David Wright (@DavidWright_CNN) May 10, 2017Another deeply disturbing sign they need a handpicked interim Director? Why is the default, Andy McCabe, not sufficient? https://t.co/92pagYV5e7  Ned Price (@nedprice) May 10, 2017By picking the next FBI director outside of the typical process   and circumventing a confirmation hearing   the White House hopes to get an ally in the middle of the investigation   another strong motive for firing Comey in the first place. Even if a full-time replacement eventually comes along, the dysfunction and partisanship created in this scenario could make the entire case dissolve. If you were a witness who knew of criminal wrongdoing from someone on Trump s team and you just watched the FBI director get fired and replaced by someone handpicked by Trump s close friend would you want to come forward? It s clear Trump sure hopes not.McConnell is enabling all of this. As usual. In a show of loyalty to the president, McConnell slammed Democrats who had called for an independent investigation and instead went on a lengthy rant about Obamacare and what he thought of as  Democratic hypocrisy. Senator McConnell has decided to side with the White House in their spin that they fired Director Comey as a favor to Democrats.  Matt House (@mattwhouse) May 10, 2017In a moment where the country can be said to be facing a real constitutional crisis, McConnell is choosing to smear his Democratic enemies and stand with undemocratic strongarm tactics from a president. It was a disgusting display of partisanship in the face of an unprecedented move by a sitting president to silence his critics and kill an investigation into his own wrongdoing. Having watched McConnell spend a decade refining the art of obstruction, it appears that this final act of obstruction of justice will be his masterpiece.Featured image via Aaron P.

7170, Maddow: It’s ‘A Farce’ To Pretend The GOP Doesn’t Agree With Trump On Abortion (VIDEO),"Rachel Maddow is angry with her fellow members of the press   and with very good reason. The thing is, everyone has been railing Trump s nutty comments regarding punishing women for exercising their right to choose to end a pregnancy, and rightfully so. However, the truth is, the whole GOP agrees with Trump, but no one is talking about that. On the Thursday night edition of her show, Maddow took the rest of the press to task for ignoring the dangerous anti-woman views of almost all politicians on the right. She began: I don t know if the Beltway media sort of doesn t get this yet, or if they don t feel like reporting on it or if it s uncomfortable, or if it earns you too many enemies from people you want to be sources or friends in the future. But what we are having right now in terms of the focus of the Republican presidential race and its national media coverage right now is a farce. She reminded everyone that Ted Cruz and others are simply smart enough not to openly call for something as outrageous as punishment for abortions, and he said so at a  Women for Cruz  rally. Maddow continued:Ted Cruz is right, that the anti-abortion movement in general has learned to stop talking about that. They don t like to talk about that; they like to say that they ll never talk about that. But it is, if we re being honest here, an unavoidable consequence of what it would mean if they get their way. Maddow is right, of course. Cruz has very extreme views on abortion, and has bragged publicly about his so-called  right to life  stance. He isn t any less extreme than Trump; in fact, he may be more so, considering that he has said he d go around the Roe v. Wade decision to end abortion in America for good.Maddow s parting warning is one we all need to understand and heed:So, just a note to the national media and to the Beltway media on this subject. I know everybody s all over Donald Trump on this   what will this mean for his campaign?   but covering a story like this does not mean just writing down what people want you to say about them in the terms they want you to use. Exactly. The entire Republican Party wants to set women s rights back half a century, but nobody wants to talk about that. That is a very dangerous game to play, to ignore the facts of their positions and pretend that these other politicians are any better than the circus act that is the Donald Trump campaign.Watch the video below.

22234,Trump Administration Faces Flood of Lawsuits Over Executive Immigration Ban,"21st Century Wire says President Trump s Executive Order: Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the US, is under fire in the American legal system. The American Civil Liberties Union and multiple US State Attorney Generals are filing law suits against the Federal Government  lots of law suits.US District Court Judge, James Robart, issued a temporary restraining order against enforcement of the Trump Executive Order calling it un-lawful,   un-American  and  un-constitutional.  The White House has replied by saying that they believe the order is just and within the presidents constitutional authority and that at the earliest possible time the Department of Justice will file for a stay of the order.Are we about to see a legal battle to dwarf all legal battles? Do the ACLU and the agitated Attorney Generals have any legal feet to stand on a opposing Trump s Executive Order?RT reports below with more analysis on this situation  RTThe State Department, since being notified by the Justice Department of the ruling from the US District Court for the Western District of Washington, has been in contact with the Homeland Security Department and legal teams to coordinate operations, according to Reuters.Customs and Border Protection officials said they would reinstate visas in compliance with the order. At the earliest possible time, the Department of Justice intends to file an emergency stay of this order and defend the executive order of the President, which we believe is lawful and appropriate,  the White House said in a statement.  The president s order is intended to protect the homeland and he has the constitutional authority and responsibility to protect the American people. In response, the DOJ will not file an emergency stay request of the order Friday night, a spokesperson said, Reuters reported.Last Friday, Trump issued an executive order that banned citizens from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen from entering the US. The rollout of the executive order caused mass confusion, deportations and protests. By Saturday, the lawsuits had begun, with at least 40 active lawsuits in 17 states.At the state level, Virginia, Washington, Minnesota, New York and Massachusetts have filed cases against the federal government. The attorneys general of 16 states and the District of Columbia issued a joint statement earlier this week calling the executive order  unconstitutional, un-American and unlawful. After 2 weeks in office, President Trump faces 50+ lawsuits, far more than his predecessors faced in that span https://t.co/NXMetwCLnj pic.twitter.com/2kERF2n7Ga  NPR (@NPR) February 3, 2017In California, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed a lawsuit that seeks class-action status, which New York and Massachusetts have joined. There are individual lawsuits in Georgia, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Texas and elsewhere, NBC News reported. The lawsuits claim violations of the First, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, which guarantee religious equality, due process and equal protection under the law, as well as denials of asylum and discriminatory visa processing. We re being sued right now in 10 different courts. We re going to be sued tomorrow in 20 different courts, Erez Reuveni from the Justice Department s Office of Immigration Litigation told a Virginia judge on Friday.On Friday afternoon, a US District Court judge in Washington state ruled that the combined cases put forward by Washington and Minnesota provided evidence that the executive order has caused immediate harm. Judge James Robart also said that the lawsuit has substantial likelihood of success in challenging the constitutionality of the order, the Seattle Times reported.Robart asks DOJ's Bennett how many arrests of foreign nationals there have been from the 7 countries since 9/11. She says she doesn't know.  Sydney Brownstone (@sydbrownstone) February 3, 2017 The Constitution prevailed today, Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson said in a statement. No one is above the law   not even the President. On Monday, Ferguson became the first state attorney general to file a lawsuit against Trump, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and high-ranking Trump administration officials; on Wednesday, Minnesota joined the suit as a plaintiff. In their complaint, the states argued that the executive order was motivated by animus and a desire to harm a particular group, and that the discriminatory terms and application of the Executive Order are arbitrary and cannot be justified by federal interests. As such, the order is unconstitutional and violated the visa-holders  rights, they said.Robart s restraining order covers the whole country for at least two weeks until the preliminary injunction hearing, The Stranger reported. It also stops the government from enforcing the part of the ban that grants exemptions to non-Muslim refugees on the basis of their religion.Even @AGOWA Bob Ferguson seemed stunned at breadth of victory. ""Holy cow.. OK"" he said to colleagues following ruling #ImmigrationOrder  Jim Brunner (@Jim_Brunner) February 3, 2017Earlier on Friday, US District Court Judge Leonie M. Brinkema expanded and extended her order staying the enforcement of the travel restrictions in Virginia. She also allowed the commonwealth to join the lawsuit by Tareq and Ammar Aqel Mohammed Aziz, Yemeni brothers who are permanent legal residents and who were turned back at Dulles International Airport on Saturday. The two men said they were forced to sign forms giving up their status as lawful permanent residents against their will and without their knowledge or consent, according to court documents.Brinkema noted that, although the president has almost unfettered power when it comes to securing US borders, this is not  no limit. Sha also had harsh words for the executive order, which she said was was poorly planned and rolled out. It s quite clear that not all the thought went into it that should have gone into it, she said. There has been chaos   without any kind of actual hard evidence that there is a need to revoke visas that had already been granted.Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring praised the ruling outside the Alexandria courthouse, according to the Washington Post, saying he was really pleased the judge recognized real harm is happening in Virginia. Brinkema did not hold government officials in contempt for reportedly preventing immigrants access to lawyers, a violation of her previous order. She told the court that she didn t have enough information to make the contempt determination, even though Virginia had cited news reports and affidavits from lawmakers that US Customs and Border Patrol agents had not allowed attorneys access to the visa holders. There were so many lawyers there willing to help, and not a single one got access, Virginia Solicitor General Stuart Raphael said during the hearing.Brinkema also required that, by Thursday, the federal government provide Virginia with a list of all people with valid visas who were denied entry or removed from the US who had Virginia ties since the order was signed. At least 350 students at state universities, as well as professors and other employees, were affected by the executive order, Virginia officials said.On Thursday, the ACLU filed a lawsuit in a California federal district court, accusing the Trump administration of violating the religious freedom of those visa holders who were barred from entering the country. It proposes class-action status on behalf of nationals who are living or have lived in the United States and are from the seven countries listed in the executive order. Senior advisers to defendant Trump have engaged in anti-Muslim rhetoric that provides additional support for the notion that the executive order was prompted by animus toward Islam and Muslims, the suit said.New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey announced Tuesday that they would join lawsuits filed by the ACLU chapters in their respective states. As I ve made clear: President Trump s executive action is unconstitutional, unlawful, and fundamentally un-American, Schneiderman said in a statement. That is why my office will be filing to join the federal lawsuit against President Trump and his administration. I m proud to partner with these organizations to fight to permanently strike down this dangerous and discriminatory order. Although the Bay State has joined in the ACLU s lawsuit, Massachusetts state attorneys were in court seeking an extension to the seven-day restraining order against Trump s travel ban that was originally granted there on Sunday. US District Judge Nathaniel Gorton did not issue an extension, but is reviewing arguments and will rule by Sunday.However, Robart s nationwide restraining order provides coverage in case Gorton s ruling does not extend the local stay.I don't wake up every day looking for a way to sue Donald Trump. But we are 10 days in and I've filed three cases already.  Maura Healey (@maura_healey) January 31, 2017 If an Executive Order looks like a Muslim ban, acts like a Muslim ban, and has been talked about as a Muslim ban, then it s probably a Muslim ban, Friday s complaint read.The initial lawsuit in the commonwealth was filed Sunday on behalf of two state university professors from Iran with green cards who were detained at Boston s Logan Airport on their way back from an academic conference. An amended complaint added six new plaintiffs, including several non-citizens legally in the US who are afraid they will be unable to return if they leave the country, WHDH reported.Indeed, visas for two of the plaintiffs   a doctoral student at the University of Massachusetts with family in Iran and a businesswoman who often travels to the US   have already been revoked, meaning they will not be allowed to return to the country if they leave, said Joshua Press, an attorney with the Department of Justice, according to the Boston Herald.In Virginia on Friday, Reuveni said in court that 100,000 visas had been revoked as a result of the executive order. The number 100,000 sucked the air out of my lungs, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg of the Legal Aid Justice Center, who represents the Aziz brothers, told the Washington Post.However, the State Department later said the number was actually less than 60,000. The US government issues about 90,000 visas a year to people from the seven restricted countries. Some of those visas last longer than one year, so the overall number of people from the seven countries in the US is much higher.Reuveni also argued that, since Sunday, green-card holders no longer face any enhanced scrutiny when entering the country. However, other legal visa holders already in the US have had their visas revoked, and so will not be able to return if they leave, Virginia Elliott, a spokeswoman for the Bureau of Consular Affairs at the State Department, told the Washington Post.On Sunday, DHS issued a blanket waiver for lawful permanent residents, ditching the case-by-case waivers that had been in operation prior. On Thursday, White House Counsel Don McGahn issued what he called  authoritative guidance  that green-card holders were not covered under Trump s executive order.What the government says is happening and what volunteers at airports are experiencing are not the same thing, however.Although immigration attorneys are legally allowed to give face-to-face legal counsel to permanent residents still in the secured area of airports, that s not what s happening in practice. Despite Brinkema s previous ruling, immigration attorneys at Dulles International Airport in Virginia aren t allowed into the secure area to talk to visa holders. Instead, they wait until people exit into the main part of the airport.Proud to work with the great group of volunteer attorneys @DullesJustice pic.twitter.com/cet86qpHfm  Christine B (@cdbachy) February 1, 2017 When people come through the international arrivals, we line that area, and lawyers are trying to get all the information they can from people coming through arrivals, Molly Hartshorn, a volunteer with Dulles Justice Coalition, told RT. There s a great wall of attorneys asking people,  How was Customs? Did you see anything strange?  Did anything get handed out on the airplane that was strange? Did they make you sign anything? Even on Tuesday, after the ruling, lawyers were still only gaining information from arriving passengers who were allowed to enter the US, Sirine Shebaya, a volunteer lawyer, told Vox. Although returning green-card holders were being allowed in the country after extensive screening, first-time lawful permanent residents were still being turned away.A beautiful crew of folks who fed us and stood with signs to support all those coming in from customs. pic.twitter.com/dVyfatXS61  Justin Eisele (@Jteisele) February 2, 2017Customs and Border Patrol agents refused to talk to Shebaya or Azadeh Erfani, who works with the Capital Area Immigrants  Rights Coalition, according to Vox. That doesn t mean that the CBP employees agree with the executive order, however. Asylum law requires CBP officers to affirmatively ask if an applicant fears return when placing them into expedited removal, an immigration official told The Intercept. By pressuring them to simply get on a plane without going into formal removal proceedings, they are violating our obligations under the refugee convention. We are violating international law.

11392,"TRUMP TO END FUNDING For Taxpayer-Funded, Leftist Propaganda Public Broadcasting Corp.","Forcing taxpaying Americans to fund liberal propaganda television and radio shows is similar to union bosses forcing conservative union members to contribute their hard earned dues to help candidates like Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama win elections. No American should have to pay for government funded media outlets who pass off biased opinions by liberal hosts as  news  or television shows that work to indoctrinate our youth. The Trump administration will end federal involvement with the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, according to Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney.Mike Gonzales, VP of Communications for the Heritage Foundation sums up the insanity of government funding for the CPB in this US News piece: There s a reason liberals have taken up Big Bird as the face of public broadcasting and not, say, Bill Moyers. Mr. Bird is feathery and cuddly, while Moyers likes to compare American flag lapel pins to Mao s Little Red Book. This is how the left undermines our institutions from within: make the effort appear homey and apple pie-ish. Show Big Bird, not Big Bill. Moyers is not alone. Many other journalists at PBS and NPR equally epitomize an aloof liberal elite that has squandered half the nation s trust in the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Over at NPR there is Nina Totenberg, who once wished AIDS on the grandchildren of Sen. Jesse Helms. No, Totenberg won t be the face of the pro-public broadcasting effort, either. Elmo is being pressed into service.I don t mean to pick on Moyers or Totenberg. They are no different from many of their brethren in other publications. For some reason probably because liberals want to change American society, which they see as inferior, and people who want to change society tend to go into journalism most people in the profession are liberal. In one important way, however, Moyers and Totenberg are different. Journalists at The New York Times and MSNBC must constantly strive to give their publics what they want. If they fall short, they ll get a quick reality check: Readers will buy a different paper or click somewhere else online. TV viewers will reach for their remotes.Only PBS and NPR journalists think they re entitled to a conservative taxpayer s dime. And this is the nub of the problem. How can an institution that represents the views of only the liberal half of the population, and only grudgingly acknowledges conservatives and their principles in passing, believe it has a claim on all taxpayers?Yes, the CPB says that it s impartial, that it s popular, and that taxpayer money covers a tiny percentage of their operating revenue. And that just makes my point. If they re willing to ignore widespread conservative complaints and refuse to institute changes, then they have a problem. And, yes, I agree, they can do fine without our money. Their membership strategy amounts to a fantastic business model. They will thrive on it. We can use the $444 million they get a year. We proposed ending funding, but technically what you ll see it s an elimination but you ll see an amount of money in the budget, and it is some amount of money that s necessary for us to unwind our involvement with CPB,  Mulvaney said during the briefing on the administration s budget blueprint.  So you won t see a zero next to it, but the policy is that we re ending federal involvement with the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Next year it might be zero, it may take a while to unwind that relationship, it s just the nature of contracts,  he said.The Washington Free Beacon previously reported defunding NPR and public radio would likely take years because the Corporation for Public Broadcasting gets its funding two years in advance.The CPB receives roughly $450 million each year, with $99.1 million going to public radio.The Trump administration will release the full budget blueprint Thursday afternoon. The so-called  skinny  budget shows Congress the administration s spending priorities, and officials have characterized the suggested spending cuts as  dramatic.   WFB",politics,"Mar 16, 2017"
18078,"WATCH: SMARTPHONE CAPTURES NEW BOATLOAD OF “Scared, Hungry Women and Children” On Their Way To Europe…While 6.6 MILLION More Are Waiting To Cross","Ask your liberal friends to tell you more about these  poor women and children  who are fleeing persecution from radical Islamists in the Middle East The recent surge of migration into Europe has been unprecedented in scope, with an estimated 1 million migrants from the Middle East and North Africa this past year alone, making for a massive humanitarian crisis, as well as a political and moral dilemma for European governments. But one crucial dimension of this crisis has gone little-noticed: sex or, more technically, sex ratios.According to official counts, a disproportionate number of these migrants are young, unmarried, unaccompanied males. In fact, the sex ratios among migrants are so one-sided we re talking worse than those in China, in some cases that they could radically change the gender balance in European countries in certain age cohorts.  PoliticoA leaked German government report has warned, that up to 6.6 million people are waiting in countries around the Mediterranean to cross into Europe, according to details of the classified report leaked to Bild newspaper.Here s a video that s being circulated on social media today, of a boatload of young, male immigrants who are speaking Arabic as they record their trip on a smartphone. Note to bleeding heart liberals: These are clearly not impoverished men or women and children who are escaping persecution by Islamic extremists.New boatload of scared/hungry women and children on their way to Europe. At least they had their smart phone to document the journey. pic.twitter.com/svLUy6mO9K  Based Monitored   (@BasedMonitored) August 22, 2017The high percentage of young males flooding European countries will soon be a very serious problem:Politico   As many governments, including in the United States, debate how many migrants to accept onto their shores, they would be wise to take gender balance into consideration. That might sound sexist on the surface, but years of research has shown that male-dominated societies are less stable, because they are more susceptible to higher levels of violence, insurgence and mistreatment of women. In Germany, scores of women recently reported being attacked on New Year s Eve by men whom the authorities describe as of  North African or Arabic  descent. While it is not yet known whether the alleged perpetrators were migrants, the attacks may finally be alerting policymakers to the risks of a male-dominated migration wave.Why would European societies, many of which rank highest on global measures of gender equality and stability and peace, jeopardize those hard-won and enviable rankings?That imbalance might not sound radical, but it is, especially when you look more closely at who those males are. It s true that many male migrants hope that, if granted asylum, they will be joined in Europe by their wives and children, who would help balance out national sex ratios. But importantly, more than 20 percent of migrants are minors below the age of 18, and the IOM estimates that more than half of those minors traveling to Europe are traveling as unaccompanied minors 90 percent of whom are males. This heavily male subset is all but guaranteed asylum because of their status as unaccompanied minors, but they get no special dispensation to bring spouses, especially since the European Court of Human Rights recently ruled that European Union countries are not required to recognize the legality of child marriages among migrants.

Let me talk about this little coward thing for a second. The word coward is usually used by people who have done most of the htings that you ve done: like embellishing lies about your credentials as a journalist, like the fact that your own daughter in a testimony in a court case according to the Washington Post, said that you dragged your ex-wife down a flight of stairs, you want to talk about coward homeboy, and you point a finger this way, look at the three that are coming back. We know who the coward is. Williams went on to point out his service in the military while noting that O Reilly skipped his service.O Reilly has often played the bully on his successful Fox News show. He regularly talks over guests that he disagrees with, and has even gone so far as to order that the microphones of those on the program be  cut  if he happens to be losing an argument.O Reilly was also caught repeatedly embellishing his stories about his time as a news reporter. He claimed to have been in the middle of the action in the Falkland Islands war when he was far away according to those who were with him.

18412,BREAKING: CNN PRODUCER Caught On Undercover Video Trashing Trump: “Voters “Stupid as Sh*t” [Video],"Project Veritas  newest video from the American Pravda: CNN series exposes Jimmy Carr, the Associate Producer for CNN s New Day attacking President Donald Trump and admitting that CNN has a left-leaning bias. When asked by an undercover journalist if CNN is impartial, Carr plainly responded,  In theory. We reported on the previous videos from Project Veritas: James O Keefe s Project Veritas reporters went undercover at CNN to investigate the #VeryFakeNews network to determine the motivation behind CNN s Trump-Russia collusion obsession. Since the inauguration, CNN has mentioned  Russian story  nearly 16,000 times.Project Veritas  reporters can be seen in the video below having a conversation with CNN s supervising producer John Bonifield. The reporter talked to Bonifield first about the constant barrage of Trump-Russia stories on CNN. Bonifield admitted that although CNN has no evidence or proof of Trump involvement with Russia, they continue to make it their top story on CNN simply for  ratings  and to  make money.  Bonifield has worked as a journalist and as a producer for nearly 15 years at CNN, making him a pretty reliable source when it comes to how things work at CNN.Bonifield actually confessed to the undercover Project Veritas journalist that President Trump is correct when he says the media is on a  witch hunt  to take him down. Bonifield told the reporter:  I think the President is right to say, like, look you are  witch hunting me  You have no real smoking gun, you have no proof. Bonifield told the undercover reporter for Project Veritas that CNN is biased and is playing to their audience by attacking President Trump, and actually admitted that  Trump is good for business right now.  The Project Veritas reporter asked Bonifield,  But honestly, you think the whole Russia shit is bullshit?  to which Bonifield replied:  Could be bullshit. I mean, it s mostly bullshit right now. Like, we don t have any big, giant proof. The way these leaks happen, they d leak it. It d leak. If it was something really good, it would leak. Watch the unbelievable video here:Did the three resignations that took place at CNN today have anything to do with the impending release of O Keefe s explosive video proving that CNN manufactures Trump-Russia collusion stories for ratings, or for money?The story about the three CNN employees resigning for publishing fake news broke yesterday. Is ti a coincidence that today, O Keefe released this explosive bombshell video?Here s the story that broke yesterday: CNN employees have resigned for their role in pushing fake news about the Trump-Russia story that claimed a member of the Trump transition team was under investigation.Reporter Thomas Frank, editor Eric Lichtblau and executive editor Lex Haris all resigned from their positions following a company-wide investigation into the single-sourced story that was quickly debunked, The Washington Post first reported. CNN quickly followed up with a story of their own on the resignations. Lichtblau reportedly oversaw the false story, while Haris headed up CNN s investigative unit. In the aftermath of the retraction of a story published on CNN.com, CNN has accepted the resignations of the employees involved in the story s publication,  CNN s coverage quotes a company spokesman as saying.Philly.com   On Thursday evening, CNN investigative reporter Thomas Frank published a potentially explosive report involving an investigation of a Russian investment fund with potential ties to several associates of President Donald Trump.But by Friday night, the story was removed from CNN s website and all links were scrubbed from the network s social media accounts. That story did not meet CNN s editorial standards and has been retracted,  CNN said in an editors note posted in place of the story.  Links to the story have been disabled. ",left-news,"Jun 30, 2017"
20446,"The “Brown” The Media Wont’ Cover Because He Wasn’t Killed By A White Cop…Raekwon Juaquay Brown,17 Year Old Hero Sacrifices His Life To Save An Elderly Woman","If his name was Michael Brown if he robbed a local convenience store and roughed up the store manager if he tried to take a gun from the cop who confronted him and was killed by it in the struggle, the media might have covered it. But this was just an innocent 17 year old boy minding his own business when he was faced with the awful decision of whether to risk his own life and save the life of a total stranger or stand back and watch an elderly woman be killed. This hero chose to sacrifice his own life. If we lived in a world where real heroism is not celebrated because it s not controversial. In a good and decent world, Raekwon Juaquay Brown s name would be more of a household name than that of thug Michael Brown. But we live in a world where the Left celebrates victimhood and real or imagined, a good victim can always be used to prop up a cause. #RIP Raekwon Juaquay Brown you are a hero. Seventeen-year-old Raekwon Juaquay Brown sacrificed his life when he pushed an elderly woman out of the way of gunfire before he was slain in Wednesday s daylight shooting near Jeremiah E. Burke High School, the grief-stricken lady told the Herald just hours before a vigil honoring the young hero. He saved my life   I have a new life,  the woman, 67, said in Spanish yesterday while tears streamed down her face. He was only 17. I ve lived here 10 years, I ve never seen anything like this. There needs to be more police here,  she said, showing a wound to her right ankle, where police say she was grazed.The woman was one of four people struck by gunfire in the 1:15 p.m. ambush that left Brown, a Burke High junior, dead. Her name is being withheld by the Herald because she is a witness to the murder.She explained she was in an alley by a pizza shop when the shooting broke out. The teen, who was sitting down eating a hamburger, got up and pushed her to the side by a car, she claimed.Last night hundreds of people, including at least a dozen family members, crowded in front of the market on Washington Street less than a block from the school where Brown fell.Some men turned and walked away in tears while several women dabbed their eyes with tissues from a box that was being passed around. Brown s mother, Wanda Graddy, supported by several relatives, walked toward a memorial for her son, where she cried,  My boy, my boy. The Rev. William Dickerson of the Greater Love Tabernacle Church spoke first and called for the killer to step forward and for witnesses to name him. We pray that justice will come in the midst of this terrible reality,  Dickerson said.Family members said they hope that whoever pulled the trigger will surrender. Stop being cowards,  said Raekwon s older brother, John Brown.  Stand up like a man. Take your consequences. Beside him was the slain teen s godmother, Jacqueline Cane. I just want you to know, whoever did it, turn yourself in,  she said.  You re not going to sleep until you turn yourself in. That was a good guy here. This was my God-baby. Seventeen years old, you took his life. Turn yourself in or you will never rest. Mourners said another prayer and then hugged as they departed.Burke school staff also took time out from the day to recall Brown as a selfless teen. Raekwon was probably one of the most loving and caring students I have ever had in the Sophomore Academy,  said Cheryl Windle, leader for the academy.  He actually had this warmth about him that I really believe captures his true essence. He will truly be missed by all of us here at the Burke community. Lindsa McIntyre, headmaster of Burke, said students and staff will miss Brown dearly.  He came to us as a vibrant, struggling, middle school student, looking for fun and full of vim and vigor. But as he grew in his high school career, he became a metamorphosis for what a real Burke student looks like. Via: Boston Herald",left-news,"Jun 10, 2016"
5894, WATCH: Donald Trump Suggests President Obama Is Aiding Terrorists,"In the wake of the worst mass shooting in American history committed by an ISIS sympathizer, Donald Trump appeared on Fox News to accuse President Obama of helping the terrorists.After hearing that 50 people were massacred at an LGBT night club in Orlando on Saturday night, Trump s callous first reaction was to give himself a pat on the back for being  right  about terrorism. You know, because not just any idiot can predict that an attack of some kind will happen in the future.But on Monday morning during an interview on Fox & Friends, Trump crossed the line by actually suggesting that President Obama is not doing anything to fight terrorism and may be aiding the terrorists. He doesn t get it or he gets it better than anybody understands. It s one or the other,  Trump said.  And either one is unacceptable. We re led by a man who is a very   look, we re led by a man that either is, is not tough, not smart, or he s got something else in mind. And the something else in mind, you know, people can t believe it. People cannot   they cannot believe that President Obama is acting the ways he acts and can t even mention the words radical Islamic terrorism. There s something going on. It s inconceivable. Here s the video via YouTube.President Obama doesn t need to say words to defeat ISIS. Despite what Trump says, Obama has been fighting ISIS for a long time now even as Republicans in Congress refuse to declare war on the terrorist organization they paved the way for in the first place by invading Iraq back during the Bush Administration. Claiming that President Obama is in league with the terrorists is just absurd and outrageous.Airstrikes killed a top ISIS leader in March, which was only the second such strike to take out a member of ISIS that month. A strike also took out an ISIS commander in Iraq in January and yet another strike killed an ISIS leader in Libya last November.And that s only four of the many such airstrikes that have dealt major blows to ISIS and their operations.But according to Trump, President Obama only has to say three words and ISIS will somehow magically disappear off the face of the planet, thus demonstrating once again that Trump is completely unqualified to be president. Because while he is congratulating himself for a prediction that any three-year-old could make and running his mouth about what President Obama should say to defeat ISIS, our commander-in-chief has been taking action. If Trump really wants to blame someone for not being hard on ISIS he should blame the Republicans in Congress for not exercising their power to declare war. The president can only do so much without Congress and Republicans are sitting on their hands instead of doing their jobs.Featured image via Christopher Furlong/Getty Images",News,"June 13, 2016"
1471," Texas Moving To Ban Jews, Muslims, and Gays from Adopting","Texas parents looking to adopt may soon be banned by private and state-funded agencies that object to people who are Muslim, Jewish, single, gay, or interfaith couples, under a proposal from the Republican-controlled legislature, according to a report by the Associated Press.Similar laws have been passed in five states allowing adoption organizations the ability to refuse gay parents or members of certain religions the right to adopt. The difference is the Texas rule extends the allowable discrimination to state-funded agencies.Republicans say the bill is designed to support foster care provider and adoption agency religious freedom, many which receive funding from the state.Opponents of the proposal are vocal about it robbing children of stable families and using taxpayer dollars to discriminate against hopeful parents. This would allow adopting agencies to turn away qualified, loving parents who are perhaps perfect in every way because the agency has a difference in religious belief. It goes against the best interest of the child.  said the Human Rights Campaign senior legislative counsel, Catherine Oakley. The bill also blatantly violates the Constitution. As a governmental entity, Texas is bound to treat people equally under the law,  states Oakley.  This is a violation of equal protection under the law. An Austin-based attorney Suzanne Bryant who works with LGBTQ clients explains that in addition to using religious freedom to turn away parents looking to adopt, it could also force foster children to comply with these discriminatory requirements.Unfortunately, this could mean welfare organizations have the ability to send LGBTQ children to conversion therapy, which the American Health Organization considers a  serious threat to the health and well-being of affected people.  They could also prevent access to contraception and abortions for young people in the system.This is sad news for hopeful adoptive parents and children in Texas, and a blatant violation of the constitution.Featured image by Joe Raedle/Getty Images",News,"May 14, 2017"

16581,FEDS SPEND BIG BUCKS On Minority-Only Obesity And Smoking Prevention,"The Obama administration has spent over $166 million federal dollars on the childhood obesity program started by Michelle Obama. What s curious about this is the breakdown in numbers and why only minorities. The Obama administration has been dolling out millions to minority only groups to prevent obesity and another program called  Padres  to prevent smoking. Some of the projects funded through the USDA are simply outrageous and reek of fraud and waste: The  Latino Fathers Promoting Healthy Youth Behavior  project is getting $998,484 so that academics at the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis can conduct an eight-week study that addresses  paternal parenting practices related to the food and physical activity environment in the home. Don t forget that this is YOUR money being thrown around!The Obama administration just allocated another $10.8 million to tackle childhood obesity among minorities, including about $1 million to a project called  Latino Fathers Promoting Healthy Youth Behavior  that aims to prevent obesity among Latino youth in a  culturally and linguistically-appropriate prevention program.  It s part of a federal initiative called Childhood Obesity Challenge Area that has doled out north of $166 million since the president and his wife launched it in 2011.The cash flows through the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and funds all sorts of outrageous projects like the disastrous  healthy  public-school lunches that have resulted in massive waste and caused uproar among students and parents. First Lady Michelle Obama made it her mission to tackle this particular cause because child and adolescent obesity has tripled in the past 30 years, according to information released by the USDA s special Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI) Childhood Obesity Prevention Challenge Area.  Low income children and adolescents are more likely to be obese than their higher income counterparts, but the relationship is not consistent across race and ethnicity groups,  the agency states.To deal with this epidemic the administration has dedicated a lot of taxpayer money, more than $166 million, according to USDA figures. This latest chunk is going to six universities that will find innovative ways to eradicate childhood obesity among this demographic. The  Latino Fathers Promoting Healthy Youth Behavior  project is getting $998,484 so that academics at the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis can conduct an eight-week study that addresses  paternal parenting practices related to the food and physical activity environment in the home.  Researchers claim that participation will  increase father involvement in positive parenting practices to address youth energy balance-related behaviors.  It appears that they convinced Uncle Sam to fund their project by claiming that few evidence-based interventions have specifically targeted Latino fathers of youth regarding parenting practices that impact youth behaviors. It will be modeled after another government-funded program called  Padres  designed to prevent tobacco and substance abuse among Latino youth by engaging families in culturally and linguistically-appropriate training.Read more: Judicial Watch",Government News,"Jun 1, 2016"
4891, SEARING WaPo Op-Ed CRUSHES Rudy Giuliani’s Claims That Hillary Is Sick,"The rumors that Hillary Clinton is sick have been flying around the right as conservatives desperately search for any way possible to take her down and elevate the disaster that is Donald Trump. Even Katrina Pierson tried to claim that Hillary has a  rare brain disease  with no evidence whatsoever. These not-so lovely people point to videos of her coughing and appearing to have a seizure, criticize her for getting helped up some stairs, and even claim that her glasses are evidence that she s gravely ill.Rudy Giuliani, who s increasingly extreme and will do anything to remain endeared to Donald Trump, earned a lot of flak for claiming that Hillary Clinton is sick, too, without a any evidence other than online videos. The Washington Post decided to hit Giuliani back on that with an op-ed titled,  Is Rudy Giuliani Okay? The first three paragraphs of the op-ed are both scathing and sarcastic, and perfect for what Giuliani has done: During his 15-minute speech at the GOP convention last month in Cleveland, it was notable that when he said Donald Trump loves  all people, from the top to the bottom,  Mr. Giuliani animatedly gestured toward his knees as he said  top,  and above his head as he said  bottom.  Also, why did he say that he and his wife, Judith, have been friends with Mr. Trump for 30 years, though he met his wife in 1999, only 17 years ago?Also   we re noting this purely out of concern   during his speech he often licked his lips, indicating dry mouth, which, according to the Mayo Clinic, can be a symptom of nerve damage, stroke or Alzheimer s disease. At the end of his address, beads of sweat were visible on his pate   did that not suggest heart disease?Mr. Giuliani is just 72, but he seemed slightly stooped as he walked to the lectern, where his wide stance made us wonder if he s unsteady on his feet. Then there was his slurred diction, as when he referred to  jushtified  police shootings and Syrian  refyoongees.  More evidence of a stroke? Come to think of it, Giuliani did look a bit decrepit at the convention, didn t he?See how he can t seem to stand up straight? (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) And what is up with that squint? Did he have a a stroke that affected his vision? (Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)We can make ludicrous claims like Giuliani, too.The Post wanted to give Giuliani and the rest of the right wing a taste of what it s like for people who aren t doctors of any sort, let alone their doctors, tell the world that they re obviously ill. The truth, however, is that we actually have less cause to question Hillary s health than The Donald s, because Hillary has had a real medical exam and released it.Trump, however, has not. The record he released was a complete sham (like literally everything else he s done), his doctor is a quack at best, and, like his taxes, he won t release his actual health records. So how are we to know how healthy he really is, despite his quack s assertions that he d be the healthiest president ever?Of course, the Post acknowledges that their assessment of Giuliani s health is ridiculous, as they should and as we did above. Their goal was to put the entire  Ermagherd Herllery ers serck  crowd on the right in their place, and they did an outstanding job of it.So how does it feel to have someone who is not your doctor, or a doctor of any kind, diagnosing you with health problems based solely on how you appeared on television, Mr. Giuliani?Featured image by Jeff Swensen/Getty Images",News,"August 26, 2016"

10449,#VeryFakeNews CNN Underestimated Their Opponent: New Report Shows CNN Takes MASSIVE Nosedive In Ratings,"CNN is finally seeing the serious repercussions of reporting #VeryFakeNews, while Fox News remains number one in ratings.CNN s ratings are plummeting, according to a Thursday cable TV rankings report by TV Newser.CNN fell to 10th in average total day viewership among all basic cable networks in the week of June 26 to July 2, far behind first-place Fox News and third-place MSNBC.An average of 639,000 viewers tuned in to CNN per day during the measurement period, less than half of the average 1,390,000 viewers who tuned in to Fox News per day during the same period.CNN s ratings slump is a remarkable drop from just a month ago, when CNN sat in fifth place among all basic cable networks the week of May 29 to June 4.CNN lost an average of 159,000 viewers per day from the week of May 29 to the week of June 26.Fox News and CNN continue to climb in ratings as CNN tumbles.Fox remained number one in all of basic cable, gaining an average of 7,000 viewers per day from the week of May 29 to the week of June 26.The Thursday ratings report is a slap in the face to CNN, which claimed on June 27 its  most-watched second quarter in history. CNN s rating slump occurred in the same week three CNN staffers resigned following a damaging retraction of a story that falsely linked a Trump transition official to the chief executive of a $10 billion Russian investment fund.The network was also hit with a number of undercover videos published by undercover journalist James O Keefe, one of which revealed a CNN health producer dismissing the Trump-Russia collusion narrative and another that revealed CNN contributor Van Jones labeling the Russia story a  nothing burger. Unfortunately for CNN, the ratings report released Thursday does not take into account the latest controversy to hit the network, indicating that its ratings could possibly plummet even further in the coming weeks.CNN came under fire Tuesday for apparently threatening to expose the identity of a private citizen who initially claimed credit for creating a GIF President Trump tweeted showing Trump tackling CNN.#CNNBlackmail trended worldwide Tuesday after the network made public its decision to mask the identity of the private citizen on the condition that the man no longer engages in what CNN considers to be  ugly behavior. Trump has continued to hammer CNN for being the standard-bearer of what he considers  fake news.   Western Journalism ",politics,"Jul 7, 2017"

2727, Trump Threatens Public University Because Protesters Didn’t Let A Racist Bully Deliver His Hate Speech,"Donald Trump is getting thrashed on the Internet right now for threatening a public university.Milo Yiannopoulos was going to speak at the University of California-Berkeley on Wednesday but the school chose to cancel the event after massive protests broke out on campus against the speech.Yiannopoulos is a racist right-wing bully who hates strong women. He is associated with the  Alt-Right  movement that includes white nationalists, Nazis, and white supremacists.As the Southern Poverty Law Center notes,The fact that Yiannopoulos has been photographed wearing a necklace with the German Iron Cross symbol, illustrates the diversity of opinion within the Alt-Right world. But, at the end of the day, neo-Nazis like Anglin, coat-and-tie racists like Richard Spencer and Jared Taylor, and oddball figures like Yiannopoulos have more in common, in terms of sharing a vision of society as fundamentally determined by race, than they disagree about.The protests against Yiannopoulos forced U.C. Berkeley to cancel the speech. And Donald Trump is furious about it.If U.C. Berkeley does not allow free speech and practices violence on innocent people with a different point of view   NO FEDERAL FUNDS?  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 2, 2017That s right, Trump literally just threatened to punish a public university for not letting a racist deliver a speech due to mass protests by students.It s a pathetic and unprecedented attack that Twitter users did not appreciate.@realDonaldTrump U don t see the hypocrisy in ur statement? Free speech IS peaceful protesting. Stop trying to be a dictator.  Kyle McMahon (@KMacMusic) February 2, 2017@realDonaldTrump Don t you try and ban free speech at WH press conferences? Or is that OK because dictators always have final say?

He literally encouraged violence at his rallies but now he is all of a sudden angry about violence at a protest?1,500 people showed up to peacefully protest Yiannopoulos. It only got violent after  150 masked agitators  from an anarchist groups showed up and started attacking people and destroying property.One can hardly blame the university for something that was out of their control.Trump is also a hypocrite for whining in defense of free speech even though he has been attacking the free press and anyone who criticizes him. Also, hate speech is not free speech. And hate speech is what Yiannopoulos peddles.Once again, Donald Trump proves that he is out of his depth and is completely unqualified to be president.Featured image via Andrew Harrer-Pool/Getty Images",News,"February 2, 2017"
8068, Hillary Tweets An All-Out Attack On The GOP’s Promise To Obstruct SCOTUS Nominations (TWEETS),"Hillary Clinton may be favored in the polls to take the Democratic nomination and she may be considered the most likely candidate to be sworn in as the 45th President of the United States and even SHE doesn t want to see the Republicans succeed in obstructing President Obama s constitutional duty to nominate the next associate justice of the Supreme Court.In fact, she got so tired so quickly of all the talk, she decided to tweet an all-out assault on Republican stupidity with an eleven-point argument about why they re idiots, beginning with the obvious:1 Until Jan. 20, 2017, it's @POTUS' job to nominate Supreme Court justices it's right there in the Constitution. -H pic.twitter.com/AWV47TRaTw  Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) February 16, 2016There it is, highlighted and everything. The president gets to nominate people regardless of what Mitch McConnell says. Surely Hillary Clinton would love the honor of nominating the next justice herself given the opportunity, but she understands that there is too much at stake. Her epic tweetfest continues:3 Right now, millions of families are waiting for SCOTUS to decide on @POTUS' executive actions on immigration. -H  Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) February 16, 2016It s not as if the right cares one iota about the fate of immigrants, but the rest of us certainly do. The president s actions are the only positive thing to come out of government on immigration since the snoozefest of Republican control began.5 And right now, a case from Texas could determine whether the right to abortion will be a reality for all or some. -H  Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) February 16, 2016Should the rights of American voters and the decisions of American women be left to a 4-4 tie, these cases could very well revert down to the decisions of lower courts and in these cases, the conservative judges who have allowed such egregious violations of the constitution to move forward.6 These decisions could determine whether we as a nation uphold our principles of liberty and equality, or turn back the clock. -H  Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) February 16, 2016Well said. Turning back the clock has been the Republican agenda for years, so nothing new there, but the ability to stave off the stupidity with a ruling by the highest court in the land is essential.8 I have news for Republicans who would put politics over the Constitution: Refusing to do your duty isn t righteous, it's disgraceful. -H  Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) February 16, 2016And the truth shall set you free. Republicans have been enjoying long vacations of obstruction for far too long. Even with control of congress, they accomplish nothing but witch-hunt hearings and idiotic legislation they know has no chance of being signed by the president.10 As for complaints that this is an election year: 1988 was an election year, too and Justice Kennedy was confirmed 97-0. -H  Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) February 16, 2016Some simple facts that Republicans will ignore. And finally, in closing:11 So, a message for Senate Republicans: Fill this vacancy. @POTUS will do his job.

16774,AMERICAN NANNY Helping Muslim Refugees Found Brutally Murdered,"Is the government of Austria harboring violent criminals instead of deporting them? It appears that this is a pattern in Europe where Muslim refugees are denied asylum yet don t leave. Open borders via the European Union only helps facilitate this. America is doing the same thing with our open borders. There are many similarities with our visa overstays and the illegal aliens crossing every day.Swiss police have arrested a man suspected of murdering an American woman who worked as a nanny in Vienna, Austria.The Austrian tabloid Kronen Zeitung reported that the suspect, identified only as 24-year-old Abdou I., was arrested Thursday at an asylum center in northeastern Switzerland, just over the Austrian border. The paper said Abdou was an asylum seeker originally from Gambia, in Africa. Some other reports gave the suspect s age as 23.The suspect was arrested nine days after Vienna police found the body of 25-year-old Colorado native Lauren Mann in her Vienna apartment. Mann was found lying face-down on a mattress with traces of her blood on the floor. An autopsy gave suffocation as the cause of Mann s death.The suspect s arrest was confirmed by Swiss officials Monday.Kronen Zeitung reported that the suspect s DNA was found at the crime scene and authorities tracked his cell phone to the refugee center in Switzerland.The paper had previously reported that Abdou I. had migrated to Italy in 2012 and had later requested asylum in Germany. However, his application was denied and he was threatened with deportation due to a series of criminal offenses, including a 2014 conviction for sexual abuse of minors.Kronen Zeitung reported that friends and classmates of Mann told the paper that she often went to train stations and shelters to help distribute food and blankets to asylum-seekers, and wanted to help the suspect. The report said that though she did not know of his criminal history, she knew he faced deportation back to Africa.Via: FOX News ",Government News,"Feb 9, 2016"
3451, Allen West Tries To Hide Desire To Exterminate Muslims So He Can Get Trump Appointment,"Well, this came back to bite Allen West on the ass.The former Republican congressman from Florida apparently wants to be part of Donald Trump s cabinet. So he had to scrub and make up a pathetic excuse to explain a very racist post on his Facebook page.In celebration of Trump s choice of former General James Mattis to be Secretary of Defense, West posted a meme of Mattis with the caption,  Fired by Obama to please the Muslims. Hired by Trump to exterminate them. Here s the now-deleted post via Twitter.Once in a while, the mask slips down   and people like Allen West reveal their true thoughts. pic.twitter.com/zaREZ34VdF  Imraan Siddiqi (@imraansiddiqi) December 11, 2016That s right. West literally cheered for Mattis because he expects him to commit genocide against 1.6 billion people who practice Islam.It s despicable and West should be automatically taken out of consideration for any spot on Trump s team.But in an effort to cover his ass, West has the editor-in-chief of his website take responsibility for the post and apologized for it. You know, because West is too cowardly to do it himself. As editor in chief, I must take full responsibility for this, although I was not the one who posted it, and it was posted without my knowledge,  Michele Hickford claimed.  I neither condone nor support the message included in the meme. This meme was not created by me or any of our writers. It was reposted from another source. The image has been removed. Its message was despicable, offensive to many, and a terrible error in judgment by the person who posted it. Furthermore, it does not reflect Col. West s beliefs, principles and values. Clearly, West is still incapable of taking responsibility for things himself, just like Donald Trump. And it s not like there isn t any proof that West hates Muslims and has no problem committing war crimes against them.Four of the men under his command in Iraq beat an Iraqi policeman in an effort to get information. West then threatened to kill the man by firing his pistol near the man s head. This is torture and to make it stop, the man gave meaningless information to his tormentors. West should have faced a court-martial but he was allowed to retire instead will full benefits.So Allen West has no business being put in charge of a government department nor should he be placed in any position of authority in our government at all. His hatred of Muslims disqualifies him and it would be an insult to humanity to appoint him.Featured Image: Wikimedia",News,"December 11, 2016"
21688,WHY TAXPAYER FUNDED FOOD TRUCKS PLAN TO STALK KIDS THIS SUMMER,"I wonder how many government funded trucks will be following Mooch s kids this summer? Oh, that s right she s a  good  mom. There s no need for government intervention Government-sponsored food trucks will be stalking students this summer with the goal of giving out thousands of  healthy  free lunches officials don t trust parents to provide.Officials at St. Paul public schools recently announced they re working with the local food bank Second Harvest to dispatch a mobile food truck to expand locations offering students free lunches during the summer. Last year the district supplied 71 locations, and the truck will help to add another 10 to 15 in 2015, KSTP reports.The district s director of nutrition services, Stacy Koppen, said the truck will drive around to different locations between 10:30 a.m. and 5 p.m. to help feed the city s needy youngsters. The truck will track down students at  spots like suggested basketball courts or fields where kids like to play,  according to the news site.The very expensive-looking specially rigged step van features a billboard with grinning teens alongside the message  Kids and teens: Get your free meals here.  The district apparently didn t offer the details on how the new program is financed, or how much the truck cost, and the news station didn t bother to ask. School officials said the truck will be manned by volunteers.Koppen said the district serves 29,000 lunches a day during the school year, but only 6,000 a day during the summer, so officials reasoned a truck is necessary to make sure students aren t starving. Time and again, we such a steep decline that we wonder,  Where are these children going? Are they getting the healthy, nutritious food they need for their health and academic success?  Koppen told KTSP. We want to make sure that when children return to school for the next school year, that they are at the optimal health status and that they are ready to learn,  she said, adding that the free food is available to all, not just low income kids.Minneapolis Public Schools have used food trucks to give away lunches since at least 2013. The Hopkins district in Minnesota, as well as districts in Colorado, New York, Massachusetts, Indiana, California, Tennessee, and other states have also launched trucks to take free food to students during the summer.In New York City, organizations can also apply to have school food trucks deliver meals to students on site upon request.Most, if not all, of the school food trucks seem to be funded at least in part by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, as part of the federal free and reduced-price school lunch program. Each summer, the United States Department of Agriculture reimburses school districts for all meals prepared and served at no cost to any child under the age of 18,  the Grand Junction Daily Sentinel reports.The news site explained that School District 51 expanded its free summer lunch program to dispatch a food truck to patrol local neighborhoods and seek out students. The USDA will pay for food and staff labor but not for the purchase of a food truck or the cost of running it,  according to the Daily Sentinel.In District 51, the cost of the truck and expenses are covered by a $50,000 grant from the Western Colorado Community Foundation.Via: EAG News",left-news,"May 29, 2015"
18222,REPORT: PRESIDENT TRUMP Is “Odds-On Favorite To Win Re-election” In 2020,"Liberal heads explode in 5 4 3 2 1President Trump could win the White House again in 2020   which likely would send hostile political operatives and the disapproving news media into an epic meltdown. News flash: Get ready. Mr. Trump will likely win re-election, says one analyst.  President Trump did not ascend to the White House in the usual way; he broke with traditional campaign orthodoxy and tactics,  Ford O Connell, a political analyst and adjunct professor at the George Washington University Graduate School of Political Management, tells Inside the Beltway. While Trump s first six months in the White House have been marked by early stumbles, a healthy dose of palace intrigue and low approval numbers, history says Trump is in fact the odds-on favorite to win re-election in 2020, should he choose to run. Why? Because presidential incumbency has its privileges. Since 1900, 20 presidents have sought re-election. Of those, 15 won and five lost   that is, if you include Gerald Ford, who was never elected in the first place. Adds Mr. O Connell,  So how does President Trump avoid becoming the sixth president to be fired by the people in the last 120 years? Barring some unforeseen calamity or Dwayne  The Rock  Johnson becoming the Democratic presidential nominee, the fate of Trump s presidency will live and die with the state of the economy in the fall of 2020. To ensure that the electoral winds are favorable to Trump, his administration must deliver results by passing tax reform before the 2018 midterms, showing significant progress on other key campaign promises: securing America s borders, infrastructure, trade, conservative judicial appointees. He must also continue to instill in working-class voters in both the Rust Belt (Ohio, Pennsylvania, Iowa, Michigan, Wisconsin) and Sun Belt (Florida, North Carolina, Arizona) battleground states the belief that he is tirelessly fighting for them. If Trump does that, voters will forgive his impetuous ways and rehire him,  the professor concludes.For entire story: Washington Times ",left-news,"Aug 1, 2017"

696," Trump Put Himself In Deep Sh*t, Personally Drafted Statement Lying About Jr’s Russia Meeting","Donald Trump and all of the people around him have a serious problem with the truth. That problem is giving them serious legal problems that do not have to be when it comes to Special Counsel Robert Mueller s investigation into the Trump campaign s possible collusion with the Russians to try and fix the 2016 election.First, they said there were not meetings with Russians. Then, we find out that Donald Trump Jr., former Trump Campaign Manager Paul Manafort, and Trump s son-in-law Jared Kushner met with a shady Russian lawyer, along with other people tied to the Russian government. After that, Trump Jr. came out with a statement saying that they were talking about Russian adoptions and nothing else. Then, that statement fell apart when it turns out that they went into that meeting thinking they were going to get dirt on then-Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton from the Russian government. Now, it turns out that while the lawyers wanted to be truthful in Trump Jr. s statement, Donald Trump decided he wanted to lie for his son, and personally put together the statement.Trump s advisers are furious. One said, on condition of anonymity, to the Washington Post: This was . . . unnecessary. Now someone can claim he s the one who attempted to mislead. Somebody can argue the president is saying he doesn t want you to say the whole truth. The adviser then went on to suggest that Trump doesn t fully understand that he and his people are in serious legal trouble over the Russia investigation: He refuses to sit still. He doesn t think he s in any legal jeopardy, so he really views this as a political problem he is going to solve by himself. A lawyer who investigated President George W. Bush regarding the unmasking of CIA Agent Valerie Plame, Peter Zeidenberg, says of the bumbling attempt at a cover-up by Team Trump: The thing that really strikes me about this is the stupidity of involving the president. They are still treating this like a family-run business and they have a PR problem. . . . What they don t seem to understand is this is a criminal investigation involving all of them. Well, hopefully, they continue to screw up in their responses to this. There s definitely wrongdoing here. Perhaps Robert Mueller already has the smoking gun, and wants to make sure the case is airtight before they are all indicted and hauled off to jail where belong. In the meantime, the entire administration is dangerous and should be removed. Congress, do your jobs and throw ALL OF THESE people out of our White House.Featured image via John Moore/Getty Images ",News,"August 1, 2017"
9728,TRUMP BLASTS SENATE RINO ON TWITTER…Exposes REAL REASON He’s Not Running For Reelection,"President Trump just exposed one of the biggest obstructionists to making America great again Senator Bob Corker asked for an endorsement from Trump but Trump just tweeted out that he refused to endorse Corker. Corker has threatened to obstruct and be a thorn in the side of Trump because he has nothing to lose now that he s not running for reelection. What that tells us is this man was NEVER a true Republican! He s a RINO! DRAIN THE SWAMP!PROOF BELOW THAT WHAT TRUMP SAID IS TRUE:CORKER THREATENS TO HALT PROGRESS ON TAX REFORM Corker announced in September that he will retire after his term expires in 2018. Sen. Corker announced his departure from the Senate one day after Breitbart News reported on his $3 million  swamp  deal and just hours after conservative Judge Roy Moore beat establishment candidate Sen. Luther Strange (R-AL) in a Senate runoff election.Now, Sen. Corker threatens to halt any progress that Republicans have made with tax reform, similarly to how Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) tanked Obamacare repeal twice this year. Patty McMurray Corker said at the hearing,  This is some of the most meaningless work that we do here.  The Tennesseean argued that the 2018 budget amounts to nothing more than a vehicle for Republicans to pass a tax reform package.Republicans hope to use budgetary reconciliation to attach a tax reform proposal to the 2018 budget that will allow the Senate to pass the tax reform legislation using a simple majority. GOP lawmakers tried to repeal and replace Obamacare using the same strategy.The current tax plan proposal introduced by Republicans would include $4 trillion in tax cuts. Republicans hope to cut roughly $2.5 trillion in missing revenue by closing loopholes and eliminating deductions to hit the maximum $1.5 trillion deficit allowed for Congress s budget rules.President Donald Trump said that the tax reform plan  will be rocket fuel for our economy.  Read more: BreitbartHere is the article that verifies what Trump said is true about the cabinet post:Sen. Bob Corker emerged from an interview Tuesday with Donald Trump and said he believed the president-elect had narrowed the list of candidates for secretary of state to  a very small group.  The selection process for who will run the State Department in the Trump administration has been grueling, including grumbling among Mr. Trump s allies about his considering bitter foe Mitt Romney for the nomination. Mr. Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, described this moment as  the greatest opportunity in modern times to really strengthen our nation s security interests around the world and help us economically.  He said that he was honored to be considered for the job.  It s been an honor to have the kind of meeting that I had today. We had a very wide-ranging meeting, actually a couple meetings and his instincts on foreign policy are obviously very, very good,  Mr. Corker told reporters at Trump Tower, where Mr. Trump lives and the transition team offices are located.  I know he has a number of outstanding individuals that he s talking with. I was glad to be here and glad to see more fully some of what his views about the world are,  he said. Pressed about when he expected Mr. Trump to announce the nomination, Mr. Corker said they didn t talk about that in the meeting.  I think he ll make the decision when he s comfortable. My sense is he s narrowed it down to a very small group of people,  he said. The president-elect is scheduled to meet later Tuesday with Mr. Romney, the former Massachusetts governor and 2012 GOP presidential nominee who harshly criticized Mr. Trump s during the campaign and worked to prevent him from winning the nomination and the White House. Other candidates for secretary of state include retired Army Gen. David Petraeus, former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton.

19829,"WOW! GOP ELITISTS Get Hammered: “‘Weak-Kneed, Lily-Livered Republicans’ Put on ‘Despicable Display of Cowardice’ by Abandoning Trump”","The list of pathetic sore losers and RINO s in the GOP who have said they won t support Trump seemed to be growing longer and longer after the private, inappropriate comments Trump made 11 years ago became public. After last night s debate, I wonder how many of them wish they could take it back. Trump handled the discussion about what he called  embarrassing  behavior better than most of us expected. We all make mistakes. He was a private citizen who was having some boy talk on a bus. He used some bad words and regrets it. He never laid a hand on anyone, but the sore losers who Trump crushed in the primaries and other RINO s like Mitt Romney are using this opportunity to destroy Trump s chances at winning while elevating Hillary s. Unlike the Dems, who surround and shield members of their party to the end, these turncoats Republicans are not team players Sam Clovis, co-chairman of Donald Trump s presidential campaign, reviewed Sunday night s second presidential debate on Monday morning s Breitbart News Daily with SiriusXM host Alex Marlow. I thought we did really well,  said Clovis.  I thought the first 15 minutes or so were pretty much as predicted, a little rocky, to be honest, but I think from that moment on, I don t think there s any question who was in charge, and I think he really had Mrs. Clinton on the defensive for most of the rest of the debate. Clovis disputed the notion that Clinton came to the debate to  talk about the issues. She s done everything she can to avoid the issues,  he said,  because her tax plan sucks. Her record in foreign policy sucks. She has no love for the military. She s a criminal, and she ought to be in prison. I mean, I m just being blunt: this is a woman who ought to be in prison right now. If you or I had done what she has done, we would be in handcuffs in an orange suit, and we would be in a maximum security federal prison right now. Clovis said it was  absolute nonsense  to construe Trump s call for a special prosecutor during the debate as a banana republic-style threat to jail his political opponent. Director Comey has already come out and said she essentially lied to the FBI,  he noted.  Martha Stewart lied to the FBI, and she went to prison. If Hillary Clinton lied to the FBI, she ought to be prosecuted. And right now, what we have is, we have a deal struck by the Clinton campaign with the Obama administration, and I think if push comes to shove, I think Obama will pardon her before this thing gets out of hand because if they think anything is going to reveal that she has committed more criminal acts than she already has, then I think he ll pardon her. I really do. I think this is in the works. And I don t think the American people are really fooled by this. What we re talking about is establishing the rule of law, and the rule of law applies to everyone. That includes the former secretary of state,  Clovis declared.Marlow asked how the Trump campaign planned to strategize around the intense media focus on his  hot mic  lewd remarks,  considering that even the Republican Party is now destroying Donald Trump over these comments. Well, I think again it goes to the substance of what we have is, we have a vulnerability in the campaign,  Clovis replied, adding,  This is a vulnerability. Let s make no mistake. Let s be honest about this. We have a situation here, comments that were made 11 years ago. They were recorded, and they ve come back to haunt the candidate. The candidate has apologized for those remarks. And I think what it goes to is the fact that they don t want to focus on policy. They don t want to focus on the substance of the issues because the establishments of the Republican Party and the Democrat Party writ large are deeply threatened by a populist movement in this country. I really think this is why you see these weak-kneed, lily-livered Republicans out here   I have other words, but I can t use them on the radio   that go to the heart of what I think is a despicable display of cowardice on the part of the Republican Party over this whole issue. We don t need to defend the comments. I think the comments were bad, and frankly, if my son had said something like that, I d have taken him back to the woodshed. I don t have any problems talking about that and saying that because that s what I think of the comments. The other side of it is, the comments aren t what we re after. What we re after is the substance of who s going to lead this country. And that s what we ought to be focused on because the alternative of having Hillary Clinton as President of the United States is just too terrible to contemplate.

So of course he just got busted for having a sex video of himself on his work computer.Nebraska GOP state Senator Bill Kintner is being urged to resign by Republican Governor Pete Ricketts after the Nebraska State Patrol discovered a sexually explicit video of Kintner on the government computer he uses for work.According to the Lincoln Journal Star,A source familiar with the situation said Kintner told investigators about the video when he asked the Nebraska State Patrol for help with computer problems in July 2015.The patrol confirmed Friday that Kintner had sought help for  what he believed to be a potential internet scam that occurred while the senator was in Massachusetts using his state computer. Having such a video on his work computer is a violation of Nebraska law, but it appears that Governor Ricketts and Kintner both ignored the law and hid the investigation from the public since last November when the discovery of the video was made.Only on Friday did Ricketts actually publicly call for Kintner to resign. Due to the ongoing investigation of this issue, I have been unable to say anything publicly. If the allegations are true, Senator Kintner needs to resign. The violation and the cover-up has Democrats calling for more than just Kintner s resignation. It is not enough for Sen. Kintner to resign in shame. Anyone that knew this information and continued to let him sit in office must also resign,  Nebraska Democratic Party chair Jane Kleeb said in a statement.  Did Gov. Ricketts or his staff look the other way so they had (Kintner s) vote in the Unicameral? This is so serious, in fact, that the State Patrol has turned out their findings to the Accountability and Disclosure Commission and and ethics investigation is underway.This is also incredibly hypocritical considering Kintner constantly brags about being a conservative  Christian  who has urged Christian-owned businesses to provide gay customers bad service on purpose and once told the Journal Star that his parents  taught me the moral absolutes of Christianity, and I just applied those to everything. Except himself, apparently.Featured Image: YouTube",News,"July 30, 2016"
9576,BREAKING: ONLY MLB Player To Kneel During National Anthem ARRESTED For Pulling Gun On Delivery Woman,"When Oakland Athletics catcher Bruce Maxwell took a knee during the national anthem before their game against the Texas Rangers, the Oakland Athletics immediately tweeeted out their support for him. To date, Maxwell is the only MLB player who has chosen to disrespect our flag as a way to help BLM push an anti-cop movement.Here is the Oakland A s response to Bruce Maxwell kneeling during our nation s national anthem:pic.twitter.com/EHXwg8Zpax  A's, But Spooky   (@Athletics) September 24, 2017Last week, Maxwell was caught lying about being denied service at a local restaurant after kneeling for the anthem.FOX News   Oakland A s catcher Bruce Maxwell, 26, claimed this week that a waiter in his Alabama hometown of Huntsville refused him service after identifying him as the MLB player who took the knee during  The Star Spangled Banner  last month   only the waiter has a very different version of events and he told Fox News that was far from what went down. He is outright lying. This is really upsetting as he was given full service, I didn t even know who Bruce Maxwell was,  Matt Henry, a 42-year-old waiter at Keegan s Public House, told Fox News.  This all started because I carded his friend who wanted to order a beer. According to Henry, an Alabama native, Maxwell was dining with local Democratic councilman Devyn Keith and another friend who produced an expired ID, and the server refused to serve him a drink   which upset the friend, who followed him into the kitchen. He asked me,  Don t you know who Bruce Maxwell is? , and told me I was making everyone feel uncomfortable. Nobody was even paying attention to them,  Henry claimed. I didn t know anything about him or the kneeling. All I know is a friend of mine 15 years ago lost his job for serving someone a drink who happened to be underage, so if anyone looks under 30, I m going to card them. The waiter said that the councilman then complained to the restaurant s manager about Maxwell being uncomfortable, and the manager simply swapped me to another table, and that it was  no big deal. The restaurant manager on duty that day, Anne Whalen   who requested the restaurant name not be used without permission from the owner   also told Fox News that Maxwell s story being portrayed in the media could not be further from the truth. Matt came to me and told me that a guy wanted a beer but his ID was not valid and I told him he absolutely could not give it to him, we can go to jail for that in the state of Alabama,  the manager said. It was his friend causing all the fuss, none of us even knew who this baseball player was. I told him I had no idea who he was going on about,  she said.  Eventually Matt just asked if we could put another server on the table so I did.   I can t believe the story. Today, it was announced that Maxwell was arrested in Arizona after a food delivery person told authorities that he pointed a gun at her.TMZ  Scottsdale PD tells us Maxwell, 26, was arrested Saturday at 6:08 PM at his Scottsdale, AZ home. Cops say the alleged victim was a female food delivery driver who told them Maxwell pointed a gun at her.It s unclear what led up to the incident.SPD says Maxwell was booked on charges of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and disorderly conduct.Cops say he is in custody and awaiting his initial appearance in front of a judge.

5664, Trump Makes ANOTHER Racist Joke About Mexicans And It’s Worse Than Ever (VIDEO),"Donald Trump has been making racist comments about the Hispanic population since the beginning of his campaign, and no matter how much heat he gets for it, it s becoming clear that he has absolutely no intention of stopping. This afternoon, Trump made yet another racist joke about Mexicans, and it s just as disrespectful and disgusting as his comments about Mexican immigrants being  rapists  and  drug dealers. At his rally in Manchester, New Hampshire, Trump made a truly distasteful joke when his speech was momentarily interrupted by a plane flying overhead. Trump had just been gushing about how Mexico s leaders were  so much smarter  than America s (clearly taking a swipe at President Barack Obama) when he was suddenly inspired by the plane. He began: I respect Mexico, and I respect their leaders. What they ve done to us is incredible. Their leaders are so much smarter, so much sharper, and it s incredible. As the plane went by, Trump pointed up at the plane and joked: In fact, that could be a Mexican plane up there, they re getting ready to attack. Barely anyone laughed and Trump got on with his speech, having completed his task of assuring America that he will always be a bigot, no matter how much backlash he receives for it.You can watch Trump reignite his love for racism and xenophobia in the video below, via NBC News:Video: Trump sees a plane overhead, says  That could be a Mexican plane up there they re getting ready to attack.  https://t.co/ryWXqnrMgx  Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) June 30, 2016One thing is for sure   if Trump becomes President of the United States, the leaders of Mexico that Trump has praised so much won t be returning the favor. Thanks to his racist comments and his offensive border wall (which he insisted Mexico is going to pay for), the former President of Mexico Vicente Fox HATES Trump with a passion and hasn t been shy about it. Surely, he can t be the only leader in Mexico that feels this way.Featured image via Jeff J Mitchell / Getty Images",News,"June 30, 2016"

23139,Hillary Clinton’s ‘KKK’ Smear Against Trump was Democrat Strategy," William McGurn Wall Street JournalLet s get this straight. Calling Hillary Clinton a  bigot  has reporters asking every Republican in sight if Donald Trump has gone too far. But the Clinton campaign releases a video saying Mr. Trump is the candidate of the Ku Klux Klan, and it s all okey-dokey?Then again, Mr. Trump has already been likened to Hitler, Mussolini and Stalin. Small wonder there s a collective ho-hum when Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine says Mr. Trump is peddling  KKK values. This is what Democrats do. It didn t start with Mr. Trump, either. For years Democrats have portrayed the GOP as one giant hate group.Each presidential election, the drill goes like this: After Republicans nominate someone, he immediately finds himself having to prove he s not a hater   of African-Americans, of women, of gays, etc.This year Democrats added a twist. Mr. Trump, they claim, represents a break with all those decent and lovable Republicans such as Mitt Romney, John McCain and George W. Bush. Of course, this isn t what they were saying back when these men were running for president.  In 2000, for example, an NAACP ad recreated the gruesome murder of James Byrd to imply that then-Gov. Bush was sympathetic to lynching black men. Over footage of a chain being dragged by a pickup truck, Mr. Byrd s daughter says,  So when Gov. George W. Bush refused to support hate-crimes legislation, it was like my father was killed all over again.  When John McCain ran in 2008, Barack Obama warned that Republicans would scare people by saying,  You know, he doesn t look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills.  The McCain campaign fired back, accusing Mr. Obama of playing the race card from the  bottom of the deck.  Funny thing: All those reporters always hearing  dog whistles  from Republicans somehow didn t hear this one.  In 2012, when Mitt Romney went to the NAACP and told them face-to-face about his opposition to ObamaCare, the stories were all about how he was really just trolling for the racist vote. Vice President Joe Biden put it more explicitly, telling a largely African-American audience that if Mr. Romney were to win, he d  put ya ll back in chains.

3987, Even Trump-Supporting GOPers Are Railing Against Comey For Influencing The Election,"James Comey, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, is in hot water for sending a vague letter about some emails that were found on Anthony Weiner s computer, which he linked to Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton after saying months ago that the matter of Hillary s private server was resolved. While it could be expected that Democrats would be furious that Comey would do such a thing just 11 days before what is easily the hottest national election cycle in recent memory, Comey is getting pushback from unexpected sources as well: Republicans.Judiciary Chair Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) had harsh words for Comey, saying in part, via a letter: Unfortunately, your letter failed to give Congress and the American people enough context to evaluate the significance or full meaning of this development. Without additional context, your disclosure is not fair to Congress, the American people, or Secretary Clinton. Grassley, of course, is far from the only person of influence who is troubled by Comey s actions. Despite his reputation as a man of integrity, people on both sides of the aisle regard Friday s letter as a grave mistake. Grassley s letter continued: In the absence of additional, authoritative information from the FBI in the wake of your vague disclosure, Congress and the American people are left to sift through anonymous leaks from Justice Department officials to the press of varying levels of detail, reliability, and consistency. The American people deserve better than that. Grassley is right. The only possible connection those emails have to Hillary Clinton is the fact that the computer they were found on was shared by her longtime aide, Huma Abedin, who, of course, is the estranged wife of Anthony Weiner. Weiner, of course, is the disgraced former Congressman being investigated for allegedly sexting with a minor. So, in other words, nothing to see here folks.Perhaps most startling of all was a tweet from former Congressman Joe Walsh, who is now a right-wing radio host known for being an avid Trump supporter and is no stranger to controversy, including social media posts that could be interpreted as calls to violence. Even Walsh, however, had to admit that what Comey did was flat-out wrong:Hillary is corrupt as hell, but the FBI Dir has no right to mess with an election.He goes public cuz of emails no one has seen? Just wrong  Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) October 31, 2016At the end of the day, the integrity of our elections are the bedrock of our democracy. That should ALWAYS supersede politics. If Director Comey cannot understand and abide by that principle, he should resign immediately.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,"November 1, 2016"
4504, WATCH: Eric Trump Gets Called Out On Fox News For Claiming His Dad Started With Nothing,"Eric Trump tried to spin a tale on Fox news about how his father started with nothing to build a business empire, only to be smacked down with a reminder that Donald Trump started out as a millionaire.The Republican nominee s demon spawn appeared on Outnumbered on Friday and attempted to portray his dad as just a normal guy who started with nothing in his journey to live the American dream.After trashing Hillary Clinton as not being relatable to millennial voters, Eric Trump was asked to explain how his father is relatable to them. And his answer was an effort to rewrite the reality of his dad s life. He s built an amazing company. He s become the epitome of the American dream.  Eric Trump said.  He s gone from practically nothing to a man who s just But that was a total lie and Julie Roginsky didn t let the younger Trump get away with it.Roginsky cut Eric Trump off and reminded him that his father got $1 million from his father Fred Trump to start out with.Nothing?  Roginsky said.  He got a million bucks. Come on, Eric. Indeed, Donald Trump grew up the son of one of the richest men in America. He has never known poverty in his entire life. In 1978, he was given $1 million by his father, an amount that Trump called a  small loan  moments after he claimed that life  hasn t been easy for me  during a town hall event in October 2015.Of course, that s an insult to the millions of Americans who live in poverty daily and can t even get a real small loan to lift themselves out of it. They struggle to put food on the table and to pay the bills, but Donald Trump had everything he could ever want and all the opportunities money could buy. Trump s dad also started a million dollar trust fund for him and left him a multi-million dollar inheritance when he died. In other words, Donald Trump knows absolutely NOTHING about starting from nothing.But Eric Trump didn t address Roginsky s reminder and just continued trying to sell his dad as a man who pulled himself up by his bootstraps. He epitomized what America s all about: Opportunity and working hard and being able to achieve your dreams and what you want to succeed, right?  Eric Trump continued.  It s no different than a Zuckerberg, right, who went out with a great idea like a Facebook and developed this idea and built it and grew it and grew it and grew it. That is achieving something, right? And I think it s very different than a person who has been a career politician. Here s the video via VidMe.Can no member of Trump s family actually refrain from lying about their past?Because it s clear that Donald Trump and his children do not understand what it is like to grow up poor. They have had everything given to them on a golden platter and they ve never had to work a real job a day in their lives.

19823,"HILLARY SET TO DESTROY LIVES Of Proud, Hard-Working, Black Coal Miners To Satisfy Mostly White Environmental Activists [VIDEO]","Stealing Jobs From Minorities To Satisfy White Environmentalists Is The Worst Kind Of Racism It s always about the money for Hillary. A University of Michigan survey in May found that leaders of environmental groups are overwhelmingly white males, with ethnic minorities occupying fewer than 12% of leadership positions.The environmental groups that are calling for sweeping changes to the economy   moving away from oil and coal to carbon-free sources of energy   seem incapable of making a transition themselves. These almost exclusively white groups are helping to fund Hillary s campaign while stealing the livelihood of hard-working black American coal miners and Blacks in the communities who s livelihood depends on the coal industry.Take a look at the top executives at eight of the top 10 groups devoted to fighting that fight:Sierra Club? White male.Nature Conservancy? White male.League of Conservation Voters? White male.AdvertisementWorld Wildlife Fund? White male.Environmental Defense Fund? White male.Friends of the Earth? White male.National Audubon Society? White male.Nature Conservancy? White male.Yet, Hillary persists in her desire to shut down the coal industry that has given minorities a way to live a middle to upper middle-class lifestyle, as a way to satisfy her white donors and activists.Watch here as coal miner confronts Hillary on her promise to shut down coal industry:https://youtu.be/-aiHD7AcfbsCoal was booming, and work was plentiful. By the 1930s, the industry employed 400,000 miners, 55,000 of whom were black. African Americans were restricted to more physically demanding positions requiring less skill, earning 30 percent less than whites. But their wages were still high by national standards: $118.30 per month, according to one 1929 survey. By contrast, a national study in 1939 later found that black men earned an average income of $460 per year.By the 1950s, African Americans made up 24 percent of McDowell s population, compared with 6 percent statewide. Locals came to refer to the area as  the Free State of McDowell.  Black doctors, lawyers and entrepreneurs also flocked to the county, drawn to the promise of a better life. Even in the Jim Crow era, unions in the area were integrated, blacks in West Virginia enjoyed voting rights, and local political leadership included many people of color. Everybody had money,  says Clif Moore, a current state delegate for McDowell who was born in the county in 1949.  It was sort of like little New York. Like a little Manhattan. Everything was popping. But at mid-century, as machines began to take over the tasks of drilling and blasting coal and hauling it above ground, black miners were the first to lose their jobs. What had once been an all but certain gateway to the middle class began to close. African Americans fled the industry at even higher rates than whites; by 1960, the share of black workers in coal shrank to 6.6 from 12 percent a decade earlier. In 2014, the most recent year for which Bureau of Labor Statistics data are available, only about 2,500 blacks worked as coal miners, less than 3 percent of the total.Coal has seen booms and busts before, but for locals, this time feels different. Production in Appalachia fell last year by 13 percent (and 10 percent nationwide) as tougher environmental regulations and cheaper natural gas choked off demand for the highly polluting fossil fuel. Last month, the Obama administration announced a moratorium on new coal leases on public lands. Many of the area s mines have closed. Shops are often empty; drug use is rampant. McDowell is now West Virginia s poorest county.Still, families who ve lived here for generations say they re reluctant to leave. They praise the region s physical beauty, close-knit family life and friendly Southern manners.  It s a different kind of black folk here.   They dress differently, they talk differently, they carry themselves differently. They have a little arrogance about them,  says Moore with a grin.Wade, like others here, harbors particular resentment for the Obama administration.  He hasn t done anything for us,  says the 88-year-old, leaning back on a couch in his living room overlooking the mountains.  If he were running again, I just couldn t vote for him. And I ve been a Democrat my whole life. When Wade first started in the mines, Franklin D. Roosevelt was president. It was a dangerous gig, but Wade didn t worry much about safety, even after his brother nearly died in a motor accident underground and his father lost an eye in a roof collapse. Wade says he didn t witness much discrimination, either.  I had some of the nicest white friends that you would ever want to meet. He got involved in the mine s union, serving as president, and later took a job with the United Mine Workers of America. From 2005 to 2011, after his retirement, he also served as mayor of Keystone. But while he cared about local politics, his heart was in the mines. Even today, Wade drives the 30 minutes to the union offices once a week just to say hello.For Jeremy McMillian, 25, working in the mines was difficult at first. He was one of just 13 black employees among roughly 400 at the Pinnacle Mine in Pineville, West Virginia, he says. Occasionally, people directed racial slurs his way, but more often, they simply ignored him.  People not talking to you, just walking by you like you re invisible,  says McMillian.  It s been days I wanted to snap, go crazy. They ll push your buttons. But over five years of running a coal buggy in and out of the mine, he gradually grew close to some colleagues.  I can t blame them. Their parents taught them that. McMillian never thought he d be a coal miner. His father was a cop, and his stepdad, who raised him, owned a roofing business. No one in high school had ambitions to work in the mines unless their fathers did, so McMillian never expected to end up there. In fact, he was afraid of the mines. He d heard of coal workers  pneumoconiosis, more commonly known as black lung. (A recent report found that after near eradication 15 years ago, black lung has resurged as coal miners work longer hours, often in dirtier conditions.) And he didn t think it was a profession welcome to black people. So after high school, he found a job as a mechanic.But when a father of a friend, a white man who d worked in the mines for 32 years, told him he could earn six figures as a coal miner, McMillian signed on. His health concerns haven t evaporated, though. You can make $100,00 a year,  he says.  They pay you that much because it s a dangerous job.  Each time a shift of workers prepares to go underground, he says, they pray together.  All I can do and pray [is that] it ain t my last day in the mines. His wife, a cheerleading coach at the local high school, is ready for him to quit. But there aren t many other jobs available. He has two children to provide for   a 7-year-old daughter and 7-month-old girl. He s studying for his roofing license so he can take over his stepfather s business one day. But he plans to keep working in coal as long as it s viable.That may not be long. In October, his employer, Cliffs Natural Resources, announced it was laying off more than 200 people   roughly half its staff   at the Pinnacle Mine. McMillian kept his job, but his overtime hours were capped, costing him about $2,300 a month, he says. He was relieved, though, to still have a job.McMillian says he s frustrated that so many national politicians seem to be turning against coal.  We don t like Obama  cause he don t like us,  he says. Instead, he may vote for Donald Trump:  He talk a good game,  McMillian says.  We ll see if he stick to it. I mean, who wouldn t want to pay less taxes?  He says he pays up to $2,400 a month in state and federal taxes on his monthly salary, which ranges from $4,000 to $4,500, depending on his hours.Two days before New Year s, McMillian was laid off. But as he was making plans to start a job as a truck driver hauling cars and heavy equipment cross-country, he was called back to the mines. He s happy to be back at work, for now. But he imagines he ll soon have to give up coal for trucking.With her long, black dreadlocks; warm smile; and Trinidadian accent, Janice Martin, 62, doesn t look or sound like a typical coal miner. She arrived in McDowell County in the late 1970s when her then-husband returned to his home state to find work in the lucrative coal industry.Following her mother s counsel, Martin searched for a job too. The mines seemed an obvious place to look. But she was shut out.  They said women were not allowed in the coal mines because they thought it was bad luck,  says Martin. But a few years later, after equal opportunity laws forced the mines to hire women, she tried again. This time she was successful and soon was one of the first five women hired at U.S. Steel Co. Mine Number 9 in Gary, West Virginia.At Mine 9, Martin was a mason. She laid blocks and built stoppings to aid air ventilation for $10 an hour, a good salary for a man or woman. She didn t mind the work, but the male-dominated culture could be demoralizing.  They cuss, and they make dirty jokes, and they make women jokes, and they make black jokes, and they make Polish jokes. I mean, that s how life is, and you have to get used to it.  But none of the jokes were personal, Martin says, and she never felt disrespected.Nearly 40 years later, she s still employed in the coal industry, as the only female (or African-American) mine inspector for the state of West Virginia, covering McDowell and a few other counties. She loves her work but believes even bigger job losses are about to hit.  These communities are dying   slowly,  she says.  People are moving out of these areas, and they aren t coming back. As she drives through McDowell in her beige GMC truck, the Trinidadian flag flying from the mirror, she points with sadness and frustration to the retail stores and government buildings that have shut down in recent years   cleaners, banks, grocery stories, a school. The industry s decline is also hitting her at home. Martin once hoped her 19-year-old daughter, Jazzlee, would work in the mines, but instead she s studying to be a welder.  I raised her that she was going to be in the mines, but the mines dropped drastically; there is no future in mining now. Via: Al Jazeera America",left-news,"Oct 11, 2016"

It was organized, paid for and well-orchestrated by Obama and other Democrats players from a variety of backgrounds. Former Attorney General Eric Holder was caught paying protesters with taxpayer money to come to Sanford, FL to march against George Zimmerman in the Trayvon Martin case that got Obama s Race War/War on Cops started back in March, 2012. With so many stories about the violence and crime coming out of Milwaukee, a bright ray of hope comes from a prayer rally created by a community torn apart by Obama s war on cops.A young girl bravely speaks out against the violence in her neighborhood. The sadness and despair in her shaking voice is truly heartbreaking. These people are trapped in a neighborhood overrun with crime, violence and despair. They re trapped in a neighborhood run by greedy Democrat politicians who have substituted government control for self-respect and dignity. They have taken away these citizens desire to do better, they have stripped them of the belief that they truly can escape their situation. They ve set up Planned Parenthood abortion mills on every corner to keep their population down and have given them just enough to sustain themselves, but not too much to escape government control.Rotten school officials and union leaders tasked with improving their education are only out for themselves, always looking for the next pay raise or special perk that comes with the job. What these self-serving politicians and school administrators are giving to these communities of mostly fatherless kids are a poor education, low self-esteem and no hope for a better life.These young adults are choosing a life of crime over a job. They re choosing to drop out of school instead of getting a job at a local fast-food restaurant while attending a local community college or technical training center. These young adults don t know, or understand the value of sacrificing today for a future tomorrow, because the Democratic Party has convinced them they don t need to worry about the future. They ve convinced them they don t need to be self-sufficient. The only thing they need is the government and that s enough. That s also the reason this frightened little girl seen in the video below, is trapped in this tragic neighborhood filled with violence and crime and may never get out as long as Democrats continue to fool the voters in these crime-ridden cities they are on their side.Thank goodness these citizens, (who are truly a ray of hope in these uncertain times) are able to turn to God for guidance and to ask for protection for their community, and for law enforcement officers who keep their neighborhoods safe.

There s no need because working together to help fund a cure for cancer doesn t divide a nation, and we all know kids can t vote Picture is from Rockstar Ronan, a website dedicated to lighting the White House gold!Quite some time ago, a petition was circulated to  Light the White House Gold.  The ask was simple: Come September 1, or the beginning of Childhood Cancer Awareness Month, put some gold lightbulbs in the spotlights out front of the White House and tell the childhood cancer community and all the kids fighting and dying of cancer that they matter.The president, through Paulette Aniskoff, Deputy Assistant to the President and Director of the Office of Public Engagement, dropped the news that there would be no gold lights. There was a recycled proclamation, though, so maybe we should be happy for this small token. Of course, most of you will recall that last year on October 1, a giant pink ribbon and pink lightbulbs were festooned quickly on the White House. Should the White House go  pink  again in a month, it will be a significant slap in the face to the childhood cancer community. Yet another gesture of inequality for our kids.Cancer remains the number one disease killer of children. Cancer kills more kids in this country than AIDS, cystic fibrosis and muscular dystrophy combined. So, when the long awaited response came from the president, you can understand why it was quite disappointing.Cancer kills more than 2,500 children in our country every year. Over 13,500 kids will be diagnosed with cancer in the next 365 days. Though these numbers are significant, the potential market is too small to attract the attention of private industry. This makes the role of the taxpayer-funded National Cancer Institute (NCI) especially critical yet approximately 4% percent of its annual budget is dedicated to childhood cancer. The result is that children are dying every day waiting for promising new treatments that lack funding. This puts an extra burden on families with a child battling cancer.Of course, lighting the White House gold would not cure any children or provide additional research funding. But that is not the point. I would gladly choose additional funding in the federal budget over a handful of gold lightbulbs. Again, that is not the point. Childhood cancer advocates fight so hard for every ounce of awareness in an effort to translate it into additional funding. What better symbol to raise the ultimate amount of awareness than the most powerful residence on the face of the earth? At the present time, a paltry 4 percent of the total National Cancer Institute Budget (NCI) is dedicated to all forms of childhood cancer. Thank you, Harold Varmus, M.D. That brings me back to the small little ask that apparently is only reserved for the ubiquitous pink ribbon.What is the message here to the childhood cancer community? Kids with cancer do not matter as much as breast cancer? If kids with cancer do not merit more than 4 percent of the federal research budget, and childhood cancer is not important enough to garner the simple gesture of a handful of gold lightbulbs, then what is our position? I wish I had the answer to that question. I hope that it does not mean that children with cancer do not merit the same simple gestures and considerations as breast cancer. It certainly appears that way though.According to the news of Take Part, White House led the celebration by lighting up rainbow-colored lights. President Obama cited a statement which was quoted by takepart.com. He said,  When all Americans are treated as equal, we were all more free, this ruling is a victory for America.  President Obama had long been supporting marriage equality since 2012.Niagara Falls was one of the several US landmarks that lip up rainbow-colored lights for supporting same-sex marriage.Cinderella Castle in Disney World also took part of the celebration. According to Take Part, in Florida, same-sex marriage was illegal but on Friday, people and the Disney World partied as they have heard the decision, the Cinderella Castle became more enchanting with its rainbow-colored lights as they celebrated marriage equality.The St. Louis Civil Courts Building also lit up with flying rainbow colors. Alderman Shane Cohn spent $15,000 in capital for the improvement funds of the rainbow lights in the Civil Courts Building in St. Louis. Several downtown buildings as well lit up rainbow-colored lights as a sign of support for the gay rights and St. Louis  PrideFest. accrding to the report of stltoday.com, St. Louis recently was called the  gayest cities in America. Other famous landmarks which supported the same-sex marriage and brighten up with rainbow colors were Terminal Tower in Cleveland, The Empire State Building (In September 2014, the Empire State Building received national backlash for their decision not to go gold for Childhood Cancer Awareness Month.)Penn Station in New York City, The Seattle Great Wheel, The Alamo in San Antonio, in San Francisco, three of their monuments have participated, including: San Francisco City Hall, San Francisco International Airport and Grace Cathedral, the Playhouse Square in Cleveland, The Davis Building in Dallas, The U.S. Grant Hotel in San Diego also participated in the celebration.Ultimately, a handful of lightbulbs and a giant gold ribbon will not find better treatments or cures for the difficult cancers that kill so many children. It will not force Harold Varmus, M.D., to change his funding allocations. And, it may not cause more people to donate money toward childhood cancer research. All may be true. What that handful of lightbulbs and fabric may do is provide an additional measure of hope. And never should we forget that hope is a dangerous commodity, especially to a community that sometimes finds itself without any. Thanks for nothing, Mr. President.

2876, Trump HUMILIATED By Presidential Historian’s Devastating Evaluation Of His First Days,"Trump s first few days in the White House have been tumultuous, and not just because he s so upset about his inauguration numbers being less-than record-setting that he had his press secretary flat-out lie about them. His aides have revealed that his thin skin is making things difficult, and because of that, presidential historian Douglas Brinkley has weighed in with something rather embarrassing for a man obsessed with numbers and image: [H]e can never let go and stop watching cable TV. Now he s off to the worst start of a presidency in a very long time.  [emphasis mine]The worst. In a very long time. Those are words Trump won t want to hear, seeing as how he thinks he is the best and has the best of absolutely everything. An expert calling him the worst at anything just burns.Brinkley believes Trump had a successful inauguration despite his numbers being lower than expected, and he should have built on that. However, given that he s so quick to anger when someone anyone makes him look bad to the world, he fixates on that instead of real issues and real work, and it s causing huge problems. Sources within the White House revealed that his aides have to control what information he s exposed to: One person who frequently talks to Trump said aides have to push back privately against his worst impulses in the White House, like the news conference idea, and have to control information that may infuriate him. He gets bored and likes to watch TV, this person said, so it is important to minimize that. Really? We have someone in our nation s highest office who gets bored easily and so he watches TV to, what, look for reports about how great he is? And then TV doesn t deliver, which pisses him off, and he goes off on tangents and people get frustrated. Even members of the GOP are floored by his behavior, like the news conference about his inaugural audience: It s surreal. We finally have the White House, and it s this. Yes, it s quite surreal that we have a narcissistic toddler in the White House.The Washington Post s Ashley Parker, Philip Rucker and Matea Gold said that, when he came back from his final inaugural event on Saturday, he turned on the TV, saw the Women s Marches, saw them protesting his presidency, and worst of all, saw that the protesting crowds appeared bigger than his own audience. So he got increasingly pissed off, and, seemingly on a whim, had Spicer give that press conference that was one lie after another, and culminated in Kellyanne Conway s  alternate facts  bullshit.And then Trump was unhappy with Spicer s  visuals    meaning he didn t like how Spicer appeared nervous, flubbed some of his words, wore a badly-fitting suit, and was apparently not forceful enough with the  lying press. Besides that, there are all the power struggles plaguing Trump s administration that are very reminiscent of the power struggles that plagued his campaign. Some are upset with his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, trying to shove anyone he sees as a threat to his position as a close adviser aside. Aides are unhappy that Kellyanne Conway can do what she wants, when she wants, because she s outside the official communications department. And the list goes on.The word  worst  is not in Trump s vocabulary when he s talking about himself. Brinkley, however, knows what s what and is apparently not afraid to say it.Featured image by Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images",News,"January 24, 2017"
8895, WATCH: Obama Goes BEAST MODE On CNN Anchor For Pushing Gun Grab Conspiracy (VIDEO),"President Obama got real and raw with CNN s Anderson Cooper during a televised town hall meeting on gun violence..@POTUS addresses the ""conspiracy"" that ""we are creating a plot to take everybody's guns"" https://t.co/AFzFmmsvGC https://t.co/p611SWIrgk  CNN (@CNN) January 8, 2016Obama was speaking about the right-wing conspiracy that he is in favor of mass confiscation of guns when Cooper interrupted him and asked,  Is it fair to call it a conspiracy? A lot of people believe this deeply. That stopped the President in his tracks, and he angrily turned to the anchor. I m sorry Cooper, yes, it is fair to call it a conspiracy. What are you saying? Are you suggesting that the notion that we are creating a plot to take everybody s guns away so that we can impose martial law is not a conspiracy? Yes, that is a conspiracy. I would hope that you would agree with that. For years President Obama has had to keep his emotion in check, knowing that flashes of anger and outbursts would instantly give his political opponents fodder for tired, old lines of attack about the  angry black man. But Cooper s indulgence of the right wing myth of gun confiscation came at the wrong time in Obama s presidency. He has a year left in office, with no more elections left to fight without the need to soothe the egos of those spinning wild yarns without any connection to reality.While Anderson Cooper isn t a right-winger like the figures littering the airwaves on Fox News, his invocation of a  both sides  talking point was almost as bad. Obama s actual actions and proposals on guns bear no resemblance to the right s ongoing characterization of them as a  gun grab,  and even less so the idea that Obama supports  gun confiscation. The people promoting that idea   the NRA, Rush Limbaugh, Fox News, and other figures on the right are simply pushing a conspiracy theory on par with the idea that the 9/11 terrorist attacks were an inside job or that the government is covering up alien abductions. It is patently absurd for Cooper to give credence to this wild-eyed assertions, and Obama understandably was put off by Cooper giving it credibility on-air.Featured image via Twitter",News,"January 7, 2016"
6666, FREAK OUT: Republicans Will HATE That This Famous Liberal Actor Is Going To Play Ronald Reagan,"Comedian and actor Will Ferrell has been cast as former President Ronald Reagan in an upcoming movie. The former Saturday Night Live cast member is known to be a liberal, and was a supporter of President Obama. Now he will be portraying arguably the biggest icon of the conservative movement.Sources tell Variety Ferrell is attached to star as President Ronald Reagan in the Black List script  Reagan. Penned by Mike Rosolio, the story begins at the start of the ex-president s second term when he falls into dementia and an ambitious intern is tasked with convincing the commander-in-chief that he is an actor playing the president in a movie.The script was so popular following its announcement on the Black List, an annual catalog of the top unproduced scripts in Hollywood, that a live read was done recently done in March starring Lena Dunham and John Cho.Ferrell s iconic portrayal of George W. Bush on SNL was a key part of the cultural zeitgeist, cementing the image of Bush as a slow-witted, unintelligent buffoon with large segments of the public. Ferrell s version of Bush, along with Phil Hartman s interpretations of Reagan and Bill Clinton, is often seen as one of the best such parodies in the show s history. Ferrell also appeared as Bush on Broadway, in the production  You re Welcome, America. Ferrell has also appeared in several movies that have progressive themes that also lampoon conservatives. The Other Guys cast Wall Street raiders as the bad guys, ripping off police pensions; The Campaign lampooned right-wing billionaires who meddle in politics, like the Koch Brothers; and Get Hard again showcased the elite 1% as heartless bad guys, while the working class character is the ultimate hero. Several of Ferrell s films are directed by Big Short director Adam McKay, which of course is another film about the super-rich soaking the rest of America.Ferrell also starred in one of the most popular videos posted on YouTube by the Obama campaign (over 5 million views), where he promised to do anything in exchange for a vote to re-elect the president:Featured image via YouTube",News,"April 27, 2016"
9455,HA! ALABAMA LAWMAKER Tells MSNBC’s Chuck Todd Democrats Practice ‘Gutter Politics’ [Video],"Liberals on twitter were outraged when a Republican lawmaker from Alabama told the truth about what s going on with the character assassination attempt on Senate candidate Roy Moore Aren t people innocent until proven guilty? Please see our report below on the Roy Moore accuser.Perry Hooper, Jr: Roy Moore has been in the public eye and public office for the last 30 some-odd-years. And now these ladies are just now coming forward with these type of accusations and allegations? I just think it s typical Democrat gutter politics.A Roy Moore supporter just straight up lied to @chucktodd about the sexual harassment accusations against Trump being found to be ""all false"" and Todd completely let him get away with itDo better pic.twitter.com/PVJwjGYbVU  Andrew Lawrence (@ndrew_lawrence) November 10, 2017OUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON THE TRUTH ABOUT THE ROY MOORE CHARACTER ASSASSINATION BY THE LEFT: Infowars uncovered a bombshell when they discovered the Facebook page of one of Judge Roy Moore s accusers, Debbie Gibson, who came out in a Washington Post article to accuse him of sexual misconduct that allegedly took place 36 years ago.Debbie Wesson Gibson says that she was 17 in the spring of 1981 when Moore spoke to her Etowah High School civics class about serving as the assistant district attorney. She says that when he asked her out, she asked her mother what she would say if she wanted to date a 34-year-old man. Gibson says her mother asked her who the man was, and when Gibson said  Roy Moore,  her mother said,  I d say you were the luckiest girl in the world. Among locals in Gadsden, a town of about 47,000 back then, Moore  had this godlike, almost deity status   he was a hometown boy made good,  Gibson says,  West Point and so forth. Gibson says that they dated for two to three months, and that he took her to his house, read her poetry and played his guitar. She says he kissed her once in his bedroom and once by the pool at a local country club. Looking back, I m glad nothing bad happened,  says Gibson, who now lives in Florida.  As a mother of daughters, I realize that our age difference at that time made our dating inappropriate. Debbie Gibson hates Donald Trump, but that s not all, she s pretty fond of Judge Roy Moore s opponent, Doug Ross for US Senate In Alabama as well Here are a few anti-Trump posts that were found on Gibson s Facebook page: One of senatorial candidate Roy Moore s accusers is apparently a fervent Democrat who has worked for the DNC as a sign language interpreter for Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden, a revelation which the Washington Post never included in its original report.The accuser, Debbie Gibson, had also publically supported Moore s opponent Doug Jones before the accusations came to light.Gibson openly bragged about signing for Hillary during a campaign appearance. On a side note, we re not sure who she s signing for. The crowd behind Hillary, that is usually packed with the Democrats hand-picked  diverse  crowd, appears to be pretty thin.Here s a post from Gibson s page proving that she s supporting Judge Roy Moore s Democrat opponent for US Senate:She even posted a video of Moore s opponent, Doug Jones to promote him to her friends on Facebook. The screenshot below shows the post on her page. Interestingly, when attacking Moore ally Steve Bannon for suggesting the Washington Post was politically motivated in its reporting, the newspaper implied that Gibson wasn t  down with Democratic propaganda,  a statement which seemingly conflicts with Gibson s political activism:That s not what the photos say The Washington Post reported: According to campaign reports, none of the women has donated to or worked for Moore s Democratic opponent, Doug Jones, or his rivals in the Republican primary But notice the precise wording; it s lawyer-speak. It might very well be true that Gibson didn t donate or work for Doug Jones, but according to her Facebook profile, she did actively campaign for him, which doesn t help her credibility and it should have been reported   yet the Washington Post conveniently left it out.",politics,"Nov 11, 2017"
6715, ‘Responsible Gun Owner’ Who Shot His Girlfriend Beaten Unconscious By Partygoers (VIDEO),"According to the NRA,  good guys with guns  across the nation are the last line of defense between some unspecified threat that could occur anywhere at any time, and something else. But who will protect the world from the  responsible gun owners  who prove themselves to be anything BUT responsible?In the latest instance of  responsible gun ownerness,  a Utah man found himself beaten to a pulp by people who were leaving a party at his home after he shot his girlfriend. According to ABC4 Utah, everyone was enjoying the all-night party until the unnamed man began fighting with his significant other. Overcome by emotion, he  responsibly  pulled out a handgun and demanded that partygoers leave his home.Obviously, confronted by a presumably drunk individual who thinks a gun is the best way to get people to leave a party, those present quickly left   but as they were in the driveway, they heard gunshots. Unified Police Department spokesperson Lex Bell says that the heroic individuals rushed back inside and pummeled the shooter, who left his victim with gunshot wounds to her ankle and hand, until he was unconscious.In an apparent effort to protect the shooter, the girlfriend told police that she  accidentally  shot herself while cleaning the gun   but law enforcement says that she was likely shot while trying to wrestle the gun away from her violent and crazy significant other. A friend who drove her to the hospital confirmed that her story was false. Fortunately, her injuries are not serious, though she may need surgery on her hand.According to area residents, the couple recently moved into the neighborhood   and after learning about their new neighbors, they are a bit concerned. One man, identified as  Dan,  called the incident  troublesome  because he has a family whose safety is placed at risk by the new  responsible gun owners  in the neighborhood.No charges have yet been filed, but Bell says that those who rushed in and heroically beat the living hell out of the shooter were likely, legally, justified.Watch a report on the attack below:Featured image via screengrab",News,"April 25, 2016"
19708,"BREAKING: WHY DID OBAMA JUST Break Democrat Ranks, Throw Hillary Under The Bus On FBI Investigation?","Of course, we all know that Obama is not a man of integrity or character. There has to be something in it for him. Did FBI Director James Comey cut a deal with Barack? Why is every other Democrat calling for Comey s head? It s unprecedented for Democrats to break ranks on something this important. Stay tuned President Barack Obama does not believe FBI Director James Comey is attempting to influence this year s presidential vote, Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Monday. The President doesn t believe that he s secretly strategizing to benefit one candidate or one political party,  Earnest said.  He s in a tough spot, and he s the one who will be in a position to defend his actions in the face of significant criticism from a variety of legal experts, including individuals who served in senior Department of Justice positions in administrations led by presidents in both parties. The White House had no role in Comey s decision to inform Congress he was investigating new emails related to Hillary Clinton s private server, Earnest added.Earnest said he would neither  defend nor criticize  the decision. He s aiming to preserve the integrity of the review into whether additional emails discovered on a laptop belonging to Anthony Weiner are relevant to an investigation into Clinton s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state.Earnest said that norms about making information public should be followed.Amid outcry about Comey s decision, Earnest called the FBI director a man of  integrity and good character.

2755, Hot Mic Catches Someone Saying What We All Were Thinking During This GOP Presser (VIDEO),"On Tuesday, a hot mic at a House Republican presser caught someone saying exactly what we were all thinking.After House Speaker Paul Ryan told press that he was kept in the dark about Donald Trump s Muslim ban, someone was heard complaining that the press conference was a  waste of my f*cking time. Initially, it was rumored that Ryan   who had just told press that he and other Republicans were kept in the dark about Trump s Muslim ban until it was being implemented   had uttered the words. While he would have had every reason, Mediaite quickly quelled the rumor before it spread (a nice contrast to what we see happen in conservative media):Watching the video, Ryan was well away from the microphones when the comment was tossed out. In all likelihood, this was either a reporter or a tech who was a little too close (and loud) to the network s mic.The accusation was initially made by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi s Deputy Chief of Staff Drew Hammill. Because he is adult, he apologized for the error and everyone went on with their day..@BrendanBuck tells me that was not his boss. Will take his word for it and I apologized.  Drew Hammill (@Drew_Hammill) January 31, 2017@Drew_Hammill thank you. appreciate it. he s not really an f-bomb guy.  Brendan Buck (@BrendanBuck) January 31, 2017But Ryan might as well have said it was a waste of his time, because it was. Today, we received confirmation that Donald Trump is completely shutting even his political allies out of the decision-making process. We were briefed on the contents of it as it was being rolled out,  Ryan said.  Clearly, none of us want to see people with green cards get implicated in this. And that s not the goal here. What the president has asked us to focus on, something that we ve ran on, is we ve got to secure our border,  he continued.  We have a border security problem, that s what the physical barrier on the border is all about and we have security concerns given this age of terrorism, given the fact that we have drugs coming across our border, we have an opioid problem. There are lots of reasons why our focus is first and foremost is on border security,  Ryan said.In other words, they ve been told to sit in the corner while daddy does the important stuff.This press conference was a waste of time. The Republican Party (and Congress as a whole) has been largely shut out of any major decisions in this country if Trump even remotely has the power to just do it himself   and unfortunately, he intends to use the full power of the presidency to do the same thing to America that he does to his businesses.Whomever was caught complaining was 100 percent right. There was no need for anyone to be there or for Republicans to pretend that they are even remotely important anymore in Trump s America. Thank you, anonymous hero, for pointing out exactly what is wrong with our country at the moment.Featured image via screengrab",News,"January 31, 2017"
2952, BOMBSHELL: Trump Is Being Investigated By SIX Intelligence Agencies For Illegal Cash Payments From Putin,"You can probably expect Donald Trump to continue his seemingly endless string of tweets about the  fake news  from a baker s dozen intelligence agencies that says that he and his friends may have been involved in some rather unethical actions involving a certain Russian dictator, Trump s campaign staff, and possibly a whole mess of Russian lady pee.McClatchy DC reports that the FBI and five other law enforcement agencies, including the CIA, the National Security Agency, the Justice Department, the Treasury Department s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, and representatives of the Director of National Intelligence, are investigating whether the Kremlin took efforts to secure victory for The Donald. And apparently, Israeli spies were correct when they said that things were a lot worse than some nice escorts  draining the swamp on Trump s bed. McClatchy s report says:Investigators are examining how money may have moved from the Kremlin to covertly help Trump win, the two sources said. One of the allegations involves whether a system for routinely paying thousands of Russian-American pensioners may have been used to pay some email hackers in the United States or to supply money to intermediaries who would then pay the hackers, the two sources said.The informal, inter-agency working group began to explore possible Russian interference last spring, long before the FBI received information from a former British spy hired to develop politically damaging and unverified research about Trump, according to the sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the inquiry.Trump, who will be handed the nuclear launch codes and all of our country s secrets on Friday, has spent quite a bit of time praising, quoting, and agreeing with Vladimir Putin while attacking the intelligence agencies who are doing their jobs and attempting to bring a criminal   him   to justice. For his part, Trump has called the allegations against him a  political witch hunt  and a  complete and total fabrication,  and Americans who care about whether he colluded with the Kremlin  stupid people  and  fools. Trump may have screamed that Hillary Clinton should be  locked up,  but it may be that he is the one who will end up behind bars.Featured image by Scott Olson via Getty Images",News,"January 18, 2017"
10279,EXPERT CLAIMS N. KOREA’S SECOND MISSILE Test Demonstrates They Now Have Ability To Hit 3 Major Cities On U.S. Mainland,"When asked if a pre-emptive military strike is a possibility, as reported last week by NBC News, Trump wouldn t elaborate. I don t want to telegraph what I m doing or what I m thinking. I m not like other administrations, where they say we re going to do this in four weeks,  Trump told Fox s Ainsley Earhardt It doesn t work that way. We ll see what happens. I hope things work out well. I hope there s going to be peace, but they ve been talking with this gentleman for a long time,  he continued. You read Clinton s book. and he said,  Oh, we made such a great peace deal,  and it was a joke,  Trump said.  You look at different things over the years with President Obama. Everybody has been outplayed.  The HillNorth Korea doesn t appear to be backing off as they continue to push forward with the testing of their intercontinental ballistic missiles. They called the launching of their second flight test yesterday, a  stern warning  to the United States. David Wright, a physicist and co-director of the global security program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said that if reports of the missile s maximum altitude and flight time are correct, it would have a theoretical range of at least 10,400 kilometers (about 6,500 miles). That means it could have reached Los Angeles, Denver or Chicago, depending on variables such as the size and weight of the warhead that would be carried atop such a missile in an actual attack.North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said Saturday the second flight test of an intercontinental ballistic missile demonstrated his country can hit the U.S. mainland, hours after the launch left analysts concluding that a wide swath of the United States, including Los Angeles and Chicago, is now in range of North Korean weapons.The Korean Central News Agency said that Kim expressed  great satisfaction  after the Hwasong-14 missile reached a maximum height of 3,725 kilometers (2,314 miles) and traveled 998 kilometers (620 miles) before accurately landing in waters off Japan. The agency said that the test was aimed at confirming the maximum range and other technical aspects of the missile it says was capable of delivering a  large-sized, heavy nuclear warhead. Analysts had estimated that the North s first ICBM on July 4 could have reached Alaska, and said that the latest missile appeared to extend that range significantly.Immediately after the launch, U.S. and South Korean forces conducted live-fire exercises. South Korean Defense Minister Song Young-moo called for the deployment of strategic U.S. military assets   which usually means stealth bombers and aircraft carriers   as well as additional launchers of an advanced U.S. anti-missile system.Japanese government spokesman Yoshihide Suga said the missile, launched late Friday night, flew for about 45 minutes   about five minutes longer than the first. The missile was launched on very high trajectory, which limited the distance it traveled, and landed west of Japan s island of Hokkaido.The KCNA quoted Kim as saying that the launch reaffirmed the reliability of the country s ICBM system and an ability to fire at  random regions and locations at random times  with the  entire  U.S. mainland now within range. The agency said that the test confirmed important features of the missile system, such as the proper separation of the warhead and controlling its movement and detonation after atmospheric re-entry.Kim said the launch sent a  serious warning  to the United States, which has been  meaninglessly blowing its trumpet  with threats of war and stronger sanctions, the KCNA said.President Donald Trump issued a statement condemning the missile test as a threat to the world, and rejecting North Korea s claim that nuclear weapons ensure its security.  In reality, they have the opposite effect,  he said.Trump said the weapons and tests  further isolate North Korea, weaken its economy, and deprive its people.  He vowed to  take all necessary steps  to ensure the security of the U.S. and its allies.ABC News   On July 4th, 2917, A U.S. official confirmed that North Korea launched a two-stage intercontinental ballistic missile. It was the first successfully test-fired ICBM for North Korea, which has been attempting to build a missile that can reach the U.S. mainland.Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said in March that  all options are on the table  to deal with the escalating threat North Korea poses.The Department of Defense has an extensive missile defense system designed to help protect against a missile attack from that country.In May the U.S. conducted the ground-based intercept system s first test against an ICBM-class target. The interceptor was launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, and the ICBM target was launched from Kwajalein Atoll, part of the Marshall Islands in the Pacific. The result: The ICBM was intercepted, which was likened to firing a bullet and hitting another bullet. This system is vitally important to the defense of our homeland, and this test demonstrates that we have a capable, credible deterrent against a very real threat,  said Vice Adm. Jim Syring, the director of the Missile Defense Agency at the time.There are 36 ground-based interceptors at two military bases in the U.S.   32 at Fort Greely in Alaska and four at Vandenberg.Watch:Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida said he told U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in a phone call that the second missile test greatly increased the threat from Pyongyang. He said two sides agreed to consider all means necessary to exert the utmost pressure on North Korea. They reiterated calls for new sanctions and to work closely together with South Korea along with efforts by China and Russia.China, meanwhile, urged its ally North Korea to abide by U.N. Security Council resolutions and halt any moves that could escalate tensions on the Korean Peninsula.Washington and its allies have watched with growing concern as Pyongyang has made significant progress toward its goal of having all of the U.S. within range of its missiles to counter what it labels as U.S. aggression. There are other hurdles, including building nuclear warheads to fit on those missiles and ensuring reliability. But many analysts have been surprised by how quickly leader Kim Jong Un has developed North Korea s nuclear and missile programs despite several rounds of U.N. Security Council sanctions that have squeezed the impoverished country s economy.Trump has said he will not allow North Korea to obtain an ICBM that can deliver a nuclear warhead. But this week, the Defense Intelligence Agency reportedly concluded that the North will have a reliable ICBM capable of carrying a nuclear weapon as early as next year, in an assessment that trimmed two years from the agency s earlier estimate.

14084,HILLARY PANDERS TO BLACK RADIO HOSTS In Attempt To Tie Herself To Racist Beyonce Song…Host Asks If She Needs Mouth To Mouth Or CPR? [WATCH],"The Breakfast Club interview started out when one of the hosts, Charlemagne Tha god told his audience,  Let the record show, when she [Hillary] walked in, I gave her a handshake and she did it the right way. She bought it in, cuffed it and everything.  Cackling ensued One of the tough questions Hillary got during her interview was,  Do you believe in ghosts?  She was also asked if her pants suits are inspired by game show host Steve Harvey. Instead of admitting that she might lose half of her voting base if they were to see her in a dress, she carries on forever about the ease of a pants suit. Between coughing fits, Hillary was able to sneak in another ridiculous lie.Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton on Monday said that she always keeps a bottle of hot sauce handy in her bag. Hot sauce,  she said when asked what she constantly carries in her bag.The comments, first reported by TMZ, came during an appearance on Power 105.1 FM s  The Breakfast Club. Really? Are you getting in that  Formation  right now?  host Charlamagne Tha God asked before quoting Beyonce s song  Formation.   Hot sauce in my bag, swag? Clinton said that she was indeed serious, leading the host to joke that Clinton is angling for African American voters with a Beyonce reference.Here is the Refrain from Beyonc s anti-cop, racist  Formation  song: Y all haters corny with that lluminati mess Paparazzi, catch my fly, and my cocky fresh I m so reckless when I rock my Givenchy dress (stylin ) I m so possessive so I rock his Roc necklaces My daddy Alabama, Momma Louisiana You mix that negro with that Creole make a Texas bama I like my baby heir with baby hair and afros I like my negro nose with Jackson Five nostrils Earned all this money but they never take the country out me I got a hot sauce in my bag, swag I want you to know that people are going to see this and say,  she s pandering to black people again,  he told Clinton. OK   is it working?  the Democratic presidential front-runner quipped.  Seriously   I ve been eating a lot of hot sauce and raw peppers.  Via: The HillThe  hot sauce  comment can be seen at the 25 minute mark: Excuse me,  she said coughing, after speaking for about 20 minutes on the air. Allergy season,  she said, as she continued coughing, reaching for her drink. You all right? Any mouth to mouth CPR?  one of the hosts joked, trying to lighten the mood. Senator, you coughing like you have something medicinal,  another host said. Yeah, I need some,  she replied as the hosts laughed. My voice is failing here,  she said as she continued speaking in a faltering tone. The interview went on for about three additional minutes before staffers ended it.Clinton has had multiple coughing episodes during her campaign for president, awkwardly interrupting speeches or interviews as she struggles to regain her voice. She also had a coughing episode during her testimony during the Congressional Benghazi hearings. Via: Breitbart News",politics,"Apr 19, 2016"
12561,"MULTIPLE FBI OFFICES Investigated Clinton Foundation BRIBERY Charges,“financial crimes or influence-peddling”…DOJ Appeared To Want To Slow Down Or Stop Investigation","A stunning story of corruption, cronyism and cover-ups and oh yeah, the Clinton s FBI investigators from across the country have been following leads into reports of bribery involving the Clinton Foundation. Multiple field offices have been involved in the investigation. A report in Sunday s Wall Street Journal (WSJ) by Devlin Barrett revealed that agents assigned to the New York field office have been carrying the bulk of the work in investigating the Clinton Foundation. They have received assistance from the FBI field office in Little Rock according to  people familiar with the matter, the WSJ reported. Other offices, including Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., have been collecting evidence regarding  financial crimes or influence-peddling. As far back as February 2016, FBI agents made the presentation to the Department of Justice (DOJ), the WSJ s sources stated.  The meeting didn t go well,  they wrote. While some sources said the FBI s evidence was not strong enough, others believed the DOJ had no intention from the start of going any further. Barrett wrote that the DOJ officials were  stern, icy and dismissive of the case. Barrett wrote,  That was one of the weirdest meetings I ve ever been to,  one participant told others afterward, according to people familiar with the matter. It appears there was rift between the FBI and the DOJ about how to move forward with the investigation. Agents in the Washington office were directed to focus on a separate issue related to the actions of former Virginia Governor and Clinton Foundation Board member Terry McAuliffe. Agents inside the FBI believed they could build a stronger case if the investigation of McAuliffe and the foundation were combined.FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe seemed to be caught in the middle of the fight between DOJ officials who appeared to want to slow down or shut down the investigation and FBI agents who were eager to pour more resources into the investigation.Barrett wrote,  Are you telling me that I need to shut down a validly predicated investigation?  Mr. McCabe asked, according to people familiar with the conversation. After a pause, the official replied,  Of course not,  these people said. Some of the WSJ sources told Barrett that a  stand down  order had been given to the FBI agents by McCabe. Others denied that no such order was given.The story gets more complicated when you factor in that McCabe s wife, Dr. Jill McCabe had received a $467,500 campaign contribution in 2015 for a state senate race from McAuliffe.For entire story: Breitbart",politics,"Oct 30, 2016"
16554,BREAKING: PUTIN TIRED OF WAITING FOR Obama’s DOJ To Release Hillary’s Highly Classified Emails…Set To Release Them In Near Future,"This is not the first time Putin has warned the US to hurry up with its release of Hillary s emails. Biden better get the emergency campaign team ready. If Putin releases the unedited, corrupt version of Hillary s highly classified emails, Crooked Hillary will not likely be able to overcome the damage that will be done to what s left of her reputation. Reliable intelligence sources in the West have indicated that warnings had been received that the Russian Government could in the near future release the text of email messages intercepted from U.S. Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton s private e-mail server from the time she was U.S. Secretary of State. The release would, the messaging indicated, prove that Secretary Clinton had, in fact, laid open U.S. secrets to foreign interception by putting highly-classified Government reports onto a private server in violation of U.S. law, and that, as suspected, the server had been targeted and hacked by foreign intelligence services.The reports indicated that the decision as to whether to reveal the intercepts would be made by Russian Federation President Vladimir Putin, and it was possible that the release would, if made, be through a third party, such as Wikileaks. The apparent message from Moscow, through the intelligence community, seemed to indicate frustration with the pace of the official U.S. Department of Justice investigation into the so-called server scandal, which seemed to offer prima facie evidence that U.S. law had been violated by Mrs Clinton s decision to use a private server through which to conduct official and often highly-secret communications during her time as Secretary of State. U.S.Sources indicated that the extensive Deptartment of Justice probe was more focused on the possibility that the private server was used to protect messaging in which Secretary Clinton allegedly discussed quid pro quo transactions with private donors to the Clinton Foundation in exchange for influence on U.S. policy.The Russian possession of the intercepts, however, was designed also to show that, apart from violating U.S. law in the fundamental handling of classified documents (which Sec. Clinton had alleged was no worse than the mishandling of a few documents by CIA Director David Petraeus or Clinton s National Security Advisor Sandy Berger), the traffic included highly-classified materials which had their classification headers stripped. Russian (and other) sources had indicated frustration with the pace of the Justice Dept. probe, and its avoidance of the national security aspects of intelligence handling. This meant that the topic would be suppressed by the U.S. Barack Obama Administration so that it would not be a factor in the current U.S. Presidential election campaign, in which President Obama had endorsed Mrs Clinton. via: Oilprice.com",Government News,"Jun 14, 2016"
19535,KELLOGG’S PULLS ADVERTISING From Breitbart News As Punishment For Conservative News Slant…#BoycottKelloggs,"Kellogg Co. is pulling its ads from the website Breitbart News, the right-wing news organization whose former chairman Steve Bannon was tapped as a top adviser to President-elect Donald Trump.Brands that advertise on Breitbart have drawn flak in recent weeks, with activists saying the website espouses racist and anti-Semitic views. A screen shot showing an advertisement for Kellogg s Frosted Mini Wheats was part of an online campaign to get marketers to abandon the site. We regularly work with our media-buying partners to ensure our ads do not appear on sites that aren t aligned with our values as a company,  said Kris Charles, a spokeswoman for Kellogg, which also makes Frosted Flakes and Special K cereal.  We recently reviewed the list of sites where our ads can be placed and decided to discontinue advertising on Breitbart.com. We are working to remove our ads from that site. AppNexus Inc., one of the biggest digital advertising services, barred Breitbart from using its ad-serving tools earlier this month because it felt the publisher violated its hate-speech rules.AppNexus scrutinized Breitbart s website after Bannon was given the White House post. The digital ad firm decided the publication had breached a policy against content that incites violence, according to a spokesman for the company. Kellogg declined to name the third-party company that places its digital ads.Kellogg is the latest major brand to pull its online advertising from the news site. Other companies   including Allstate, Nest, EarthLink, Warby Parker and SoFi   have also blacklisted Breitbart from showing their ads, according to Digiday.The site had 19.2 million unique monthly U.S. visitors in October, up from 12.9 million a year ago, according to ComScore Inc. Breitbart doesn t rely on subscriptions, suggesting that advertising is a major source of revenue.Many marketers buy online advertising through third-party tech companies that distribute them widely across the internet, so they may not be aware of all the websites where they appear. But they also have the ability to control which websites display their ads. The creator of the Twitter account Sleeping Giants has been taking screen shots of ads appearing on Breitbart in an attempt to pressure those brands to take their ads down.Not all brands are shying away from advertising on Breitbart, though. After a screenshot showed a Nissan ad on the website, the automaker said in a statement that it  places ads in a variety of sites in order to reach as many consumers as possible. The placement of Nissan advertising is not intended to be a political commentary and there are no plans to change the advertising mix at this time,  the company said.

1079, Supreme Court To Hear Major Wisconsin Gerrymandering Case,"In a case that could have far-reaching consequences on the outcome of future elections, the US Supreme Court agreed on Monday to rule on whether electoral maps that are deliberately drawn to favor a certain political party, a process also known as gerrymandering, are constitutionally acceptable.Last November, the state of Wisconsin appealed a lower court ruling that state Republican lawmakers violated the constitution when they created legislative districts that put Democrats at a disadvantage and now the Supreme Court is going to hear their case. The state s argument was that the recent Wisconsin election results favoring Republicans  is a reflection of Wisconsin s natural political geography  with Democrats concentrated in urban areas such as Milwaukee and Madison.A panel of federal judges in Madison ruled 2-1 that the state s Republican-led redrawing of legislative districts amounted to  an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander,  violating the US Constitution s guarantees of equal protection under the law and free speech by sabotaging Democratic voters  abilities to turn their votes into seats in Wisconsin s legislature.The Supreme Court has ruled state electoral maps invalid based on grounds of racial discrimination, such as it did with North Carolina on May 22, when the power of African-American voters was diminished statewide due to Republican legislators drawing two electoral districts. However, they ve been reluctant to throw out maps that give one party a distinct advantage over the other. Until now that is. Wisconsin s gerrymander was one of the most aggressive of the decade, locking in a large and implausibly stable majority for Republicans in what is otherwise a battleground state,  said redistricting expert Thomas Wolf of the Brennan Center.  It s a symptom of politics going haywire and something that we increasingly see when one party has sole control of the redistricting process. If the Supreme Court finds the state of Wisconsin at fault, it could affect congressional maps in about half a dozen states and legislative maps in about 10 states in the short term, but the long term effects are still unknown. State and federal legislative district boundaries are redrawn every decade to hold roughly the same number of people after each census, the next being in 2020.The original court ruling that the state is appealing ordered the redrawing of legislative boundaries to be in place by November 1, in time for the 2018 Wisconsin state election.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"June 20, 2017"
72," Gay GOP Operative Endorses Doug Jones Over ‘Bigoted, Deviant’ Roy Moore In Senate Race (VIDEO)","The Republican Party has a Roy Moore problem. Even before it came out that the judge turned Alabama Senate candidate is accused of being a child molester, he was a problem. He had been removed twice from the Alabama Supreme Court for flagrantly defying the law. Moore has said Muslims should not be allowed to serve in Congress. He waved a gun around on stage at a campaign rally and rode a horse to the polls in Alabama to vote for himself in the primary he would eventually win against establishment-backed interim Senator Luther Strange. Well, it seems that with all of this and then some, sane Republicans have had enough of Roy Moore. One such person is former Jeb Bush campaign strategist Tim Miller. He  has a solution to his party s Roy Moore problem: Vote for the Democrat, Doug Jones, to keep Roy Moore the hell away from the United States Senate.Miller happens to be gay, so of course Moore s disgusting homophobia is a problem for him. Then there is, of course, the child molesting. In a column for the left-wing site Crooked Media entitled  The Republican Case for Doug Jones,  Miller says of his decision, which he calls,  obvious : But here we are in the dark abyss of 2017, and in this political moment, child exploitation attempted child rape, even has become a partisan issue. President Donald Trump is even cool with it, as long as the sex predator is on his team. A comrade in genital grabbing if you will. So after Trump essentially re-endorsed Alabama s Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore, this particular child predator, on Tuesday, I took what I thought was an obvious step. I donated to the other guy s campaign. But in this instance there was one wrinkle for me. The other guy, Doug Jones, is a Democrat. And I a Republican political operative have never donated to one of those before. Thus, in sharing the fact that I had made the donation on social media, I also noted that this was a first for me, even though it felt extremely obvious. Here is the tweet where Tim Miller announces his crossover:I just donated to a Democrat for the first time in my life if any of yall want to do so as well. Enough is enough. https://t.co/YlDXTXSnyJ  Tim Miller (@Timodc) November 21, 2017Tim Miller is right. Roy Moore is absolutely deplorable, and should be nowhere near the United States Senate. This isn t politics, it s morals. Now, it is time for more sane, reasonable Republicans to get out there and do the unthinkable   reject a child molester and endorse and donate to the man who prosecuted the Ku Klux Klan while Roy Moore was busy creeping on little girls. It s not that hard.Watch the video of Tim Miller s appearance on The Last Word with Lawrence O Donnell below:Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,"November 23, 2017"
20637,"SAY GOOD BYE TO LONDON: Radical Muslim WINS London’s Mayoral Election By Over 300,000 Votes","Has the entire world gone mad with political correctness? Is there any chance of saving the UK from itself? UPDATE: Labour Party politician Sadiq Khan has been elected London mayor   the first Muslim to lead Europe s largest city.Election officials say Khan defeated Conservative rival Zac Goldsmith by more than 300,000 votes, after first- and second-preference votes were allocated.The result came early Saturday, more than 24 hours after polls closed.Khan was elected to replace Conservative Mayor Boris Johnson after a campaign marked by U.S.-style negative campaigning.Goldsmith, a wealthy environmentalist, called Khan divisive and accused him of sharing platforms with Islamic extremists.Khan, who calls himself  the British Muslim who will take the fight to the extremists,  accused Goldsmith of trying to scare and divide voters in a proudly multicultural city of 8.6 million people   more than 1 million of them Muslim.Londoners go to the polls on Thursday to choose a replacement for the outgoing Mayor, Boris Johnson MP. Despite the fact the Labour Party is currently mired in an anti-Semitism scandal, if all things remain equal, expect the party s candidate Sadiq Khan MP to be confirmed in the early hours of Friday morning.Mr. Khan, 45, has had a successful career in the Labour Party, being elected to parliament in 2005, becoming a Minister of State in 2008 with a promotion in 2009. He was a Shadow Secretary of State for Justice from 2010-15, and has been running for London Mayor since then.POLLINGIn fact, as I predicted in January, the polls have changed very little since the beginning of the year. This is despite a negative-ad onslaught by the Conservative Party and its candidate Zac Goldsmith   the multi-millionaire son of Eurosceptic royalty Sir James Goldsmith, and brother of socialite and Vanity Fair editor Jemima Khan.Mr. Goldsmith and his  Back Zac  campaign have used the last few months to highlight Sadiq Khan s proximity to Islamic extremists, extremism, and this past weekend, to anti-Semitism.But perhaps it speaks to the mindset of Londoners, and certainly the British capital s demographic shift, that such news has scarcely affected Mr. Khan.In January, a YouGov poll put Mr. Goldsmith on 35 to Mr. Khan s 45 per cent. When you take into account London s supplementary voting system, the numbers after the second preference votes are counted ended up 45-55 to Mr. Khan.Last week, that number stood at 40-6o to Mr. Khan. After second preference votes, the extremist-adjacent candidate has a 20 point poll lead.While last week s events   when one of Mr. Khan s most prominent backers Ken Livingstone was implicated in a Hitler/anti-Semitism scandal   may serve to keep some of Mr. Khan s voters at home, it is hard to imagine the Conservatives overturning such a drastic poll lead.A MUSLIM MAYOR?Polling suggests some people are nervous about having someone like Mr. Khan near an office that wields so much power, responsibility, and cash.Private conversations with Westminster insiders often see Lutfur Rahman   the former Mayor of Tower Hamlets   raised as another example of a prominent Muslim mayor.Mr. Rahman was removed from office, accused by critics of playing sectarian politics with the area s Muslim population, of backing Islamists, and of distributing tax payer cash to his favoured Muslim groups to secure their support.Mr. Rahman was found guilty of  corrupt and illegal practices    and has perhaps set back the plight of the few, integrated British Muslims in elected life. He   alongside politicians like Humza Yousaf, Sayeeda Warsi, Rushanara Ali, Shabana Mahmood, Yasmin Qureshi, Amjad Bashir, Naz Shah, and Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh   have created a deep distrust between British voters and Muslim politicians.In fact one third of Londoners remain suspicious of having a Muslim Mayor, and the likes of Sajid Javid or Syed Kamall suffer because of their co-religionists  insistence on fellow-travelling with extremists, if not holding extremist views themselves.EXTREMISMAnd Mr. Khan can hardly claim a clean record. Mr. Goldsmith s attacks are not without basis, though they have been shrugged off as  racism  or  Islamophobia  with the assistance of the left s useful idiots like Owen Jones.Apart from his somewhat threatening statements about not voting for him while claiming that  he is the West , Mr. Khan s own track record is perhaps one of the most sour of all Muslim politicians in the Western world.In 2001 he was the lawyer for the Nation of Islam in its successful High Court bid to overturn the 15-year-ban on its leader, Louis Farrakhan.In 2005 and 2006 he visited terror-charged Babar Ahmad in Woodhill Prison. Mr. Ahmed was extradited to the U.S. in 2012, serving time in prison before being returned to the UK in 2015. Mr. Ahmed pleaded guilty to the terrorist offences of conspiracy, and providing material support to the Taliban.And Mr. Khan also campaigned for the release and repatriation of Shaker Aamer, Britain s last Guantanamo detainee, who was returned to the UK in November.Both Messrs Aamer and Ahmed provided Mr. Khan with links to the advocacy group CAGE, which described the Islamic State executioner Mohammed Emwazi as a  beautiful young man , and which has campaigned on behalf of both men. Mr. Khan is reported to have shared a stage with five Islamic extremists, including at sex-segregated events. Even so, his poll numbers remain firm.On Friday morning, Londoners will likely get the news that their mayor for the next four years is a man with the judgement, priorities, and fellow travellers as laid out above. This, combined with an annual  16bn budget, and an army of police, bureaucrats, and officials, would make Mr. Khan one of the most powerful Muslims in the Western world.For entire story: Breitbart News ",left-news,"May 3, 2016"

13032,CLINTON CAMPAIGN MANAGER Gets “Huffy”…Dodges And Lies About Details Of Clinton’s Illness,"The LA Times Reported yesterday that Hillary Clinton s campaign manager was sure she didn t faint but just  stumbled  as she was getting into the van to leave the 9/11 ceremony. Does any of the video that s been plastered everywhere look like she just stumbled? It s more than that for sure!Flash forward to Clinton s campaign manager s interview with Kate Snow and you see a pattern here of covering up and lying about why Clinton has been ill for so long. Check out the back and forth with Kate Snow and Robbie Mook:After Clinton was seen falling into a van after attending a 9/11 memorial Sunday morning, the campaign said she was diagnosed with pneumonia on Friday. The campaign did not mention the illness until her collapse yesterday.Snow also grilled Mook on the timeline between Clinton s fall into the van and her reappearance outside daughter Chelsea s apartment in Manhattan. Mook said Clinton wanted to cool off and see her grandchildren. ROBBIE MOOK   LYING THROUGH HIS TEETH: KATE SNOW, MSNBC: Did you know on Friday, Robby, that she was ill? Did you know that she had the diagnosis of pneumonia and if so, what did you advise her to do?ROBBY MOOK, CLINTON CAMPAIGN MANAGER: Well, she obviously saw the doctor on Friday and in consultation with her doctors, she decided to power through this. She didn t want it to affect anything. And obviously on Sunday when she got overheated it was clear she needed some downtime. So in consultation with her doctor she s taking some downtime.KATE SNOW: I asked because you are the campaign manager. You are the one in charge of this schedule and what she s doing and I wonder if you didn t know, would you have advised her to take a couple days down and not plan this trip to California today?ROBBY MOOK: Well, I am certainly   let s just say I am happy that she s getting some much needed downtime now. But she s looking forward to getting back out on the trail very soon KATE SNOW: Robby, I m reading between the lines and I want to make sure I am not misreading. I m reading between the lines of what you re saying   the staff did not know that she had pneumonia.ROBBY MOOK: Yeah, but, I want to be fair here. If we re going to be talking about transparency and disclosure, Donald Trump has not released a single piece of serious information about his health.KATE SNOW: And I will be pressing his representative in the next interview that we do with them.ROBBY: MOOK: But I hope you, I hope you  KATE SNOW: Did the staff not know that she had pneumonia on Friday? Am I right on that from what you re saying?ROBBY MOOK: I m just saying   all I m saying is that I hope that you drill in with the same detail with his team as you re drilling in with ours. We released the information as soon as we could when this happened this Sunday. I wish that it happened quicker than 90 minutes. Again, we were busy attending to her health. So that s on us. But we are looking forward to Donald Trump releasing his medical information. Just making sure everybody is meeting at the same bar here.Via: RCP",politics,"Sep 12, 2016"
6979, Muslim Woman Who Turned In Paris Terrorist Shares Important Thought With The World,"Abdelhamid Abaaoud, the planner of the terrorist attacks that hit Paris on November 13, 2015, was killed after a raid led by French authorities who stormed an apartment in the town of Saint-Denis. It has now been revealed that police found Abaaoud in part thanks to information given to them by a Muslim woman.She has now revealed her faith because she wants the world to know the following:But until now, the public has been unaware that the critical tip in the hunt for Abaaoud came from a Muslim   one of millions who now face a backlash in Europe fueled by anger over the attacks in Paris and Brussels, as well as fear and resentment of a rising tide of refugees. It s important the world knows that I am Muslim myself,  the woman said, citing that as a reason for being willing to speak to The Post.  It s important to me that people know what Abaaoud and the others did is not what Islam is teaching. Too often after terrorist incidents, people   particularly conservatives   act as if Islam is the only faith that extremists use as justification for mass murder, ignoring the history of other faiths (including Christianity) being perverted.When terrorists have hit America the hardest, their attacks did not discriminate by faith. In fact, one estimate says that 32 Muslims were killed in the 9/11 attacks.Ironically, even though his administration declared war on Iraq, it was President George W. Bush who often went to great lengths to point out there was a distinction between those who practice peaceful Islam, and the terrorist hijackers. And that sentiment has continued with President Obama, who pointed out that when discussing Americans and those with Islamic faith, it s  not them or us, it s just us. This woman s example shows that blanket condemnations of Muslims, as agitators like Donald Trump have engaged in, are backwards and just flat-out incorrect.Featured image via YouTube",News,"April 10, 2016"
19468,"KELLYANNE CONWAY Responds To DEATH THREATS Against Her After Hillary’s Communications Director Pens Hate-Filled, Inflammatory Washington Post Op-Ed [VIDEO]","Donald Trump s campaign manager Kellyanne Conway and Hillary Clinton campaign communications director Jennifer Palmieri got in a very heated argument at a forum hosted by Harvard University s Kennedy School of Government on December 1st where they talked about the aftermath of the election. There were many fiery exchanges.The conversation quickly devolved into Palmieri accusing the Trump campaign of running on a platform of white supremacy and catering to the  alt-right.  Conway called the Clinton campaign bitter and that their candidate just couldn t connect with people is the reason why they lost.Here is the exchange:.@KellyannePolls talks to @HardballChris about receiving death threats and the need to end incendiary rhetoric https://t.co/wF6jv1b8nl  Hardball (@hardball) December 9, 2016Here is the Op-ed written by sore loser and closet Catholic-basher Jen Palmieri who clearly can t get over the fact that a woman helped Trump win the presidency. It s also the op-ed that according to Conway caused her to receive death threats:Jennifer Palmieri was communications director for Hillary Clinton s presidential campaign.I know how to be a gracious loser.I could have let it go last week when Kellyanne Conway, Donald Trump s campaign manager, challenged me to look her in the eye and say she ran a campaign that gave white supremacists a platform. I considered for a split second. I knew you were supposed to be gracious when you come for the post-election forum at Harvard s Kennedy School of Government. But I decided this was a year where normal rules don t apply. Speaking the truth was more important. It did. Kellyanne, it did,  I told her. It s just a fact. Trump winning the election doesn t change that. To my mind, his win makes it all the more important that the truth be acknowledged.My colleagues and I from the Hillary Clinton campaign knew what we were likely to face from the Trump side at the Harvard University event and thought hard about our obligations as representatives of the losing side in this most unconventional of years   particularly when our candidate actually won the popular vote by a large margin. As I like to note, Clinton received more votes for president than any white man in U.S. history.Our candidate gave us a good model to follow. She had the grace to call Trump on election night to congratulate him and concede. But in her concession speech she also challenged all of us to defend our rights and principles under the Constitution   rights and principles that she and many of the people who voted for her feared could be under threat in a Trump presidency. The campaign has ended, and we accept that Trump won. But we are not laying down our principles or abandoning our supporters. That s the frame of mind I brought to Harvard.A good bit of the post-election analysis has centered on what our campaign should have done differently. That s appropriate. We should think long and hard about why we lost. Trust me, we have.But it s also important for the winners of this campaign to think long and hard about the voters who rejected them. I haven t seen much evidence of such introspection from the Trump side. That s concerning.I don t know whether the Trump campaign needed to give a platform to white supremacists to win. But the campaign clearly did, and it had the effect of empowering the white-nationalist movement.Trump provided a platform by retweeting white nationalists   giving their views an audience of millions. Views previously relegated to the darkest corners of the Internet also had a platform on Breitbart, the website of Trump campaign chief executive Stephen K. Bannon.  Before Trump, our identity ideas, national ideas, they had no place to go,  said Richard Spencer, president of a white-nationalist think tank that held a post-election conference in Washington. Former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke said this fall,  The fact that Donald Trump s doing so well, it proves that I m winning. So one person who is tied to a white nationalist think tank says he supports Trump on Twitter and that somehow confirms that Trump s campaign was built around a white nationalist movement?If you want to waste more time reading this sore loser s false and unfounded accusations, the entire op-ed can be found here: Washington Post",left-news,"Dec 11, 2016"

3277, George H. W. Bush Writes Letter Showing Trump How To NOT Be A Corrupt President,"Former President George H. W. Bush can teach Donald Trump a thing or two about handling conflicts of interest.As January 20th approaches, Donald Trump is apparently poised to violate the Constitution the moment he finishes reciting the oath of office because he has yet to properly eliminate the conflicts of interest between himself and his family business.Public officials are not allowed to use their office to to influence policies that would increase profits of a company they have a personal stake in. By not putting his assets, including the Trump Organization and any stocks he owns, into a blind trust or sells them off, Trump is violating the the Emoluments Clause and breaking decades of precedent.The most example is when Jimmy Carter sold the peanut business he built from the ground up to avoid conflicts of interest. Of course, Republicans initiated a series of witch hunts against Carter s business anyway in a desperate effort to find a scandal. Today, Republicans don t care if Trump continues to own his business, even though he is already using the presidency to make business deals and bring in profits.Indeed, when Ivanka Trump sat in during a meeting between her father and the Japanese Prime Minister, her company was in the middle of working on a deal with a Japanese company.As Newsweek explained,At the same time, officials with her clothing company were working on a licensing agreement with Sanei International. The largest shareholder of Sanei s parent company is the Development Bank of Japan, which is wholly owned by the Japanese government headed by Abe.Trump has also talked to the president of Taiwan and the leader of Argentina, where Trump s company is trying to secure deals to build hotels. Clearly, Trump is flagrantly using the presidency to enrich himself and his company.George H.W. Bush warned his own family not to do this or even make it appear that they are doing it by sending each family member a letter in 1988 in the midst of the presidential election.The elder Bush told his family that people are going to try to be their friend but that  friendship  could result in asking for favors simply because they are connected to the leader of the free world. If there is a legitimate inquiry, call my office,  Bush wrote.  It is certainly appropriate to contact your own government, but let s do it through my office so no one can accuse any of the family of trying to use influence. In other words, Bush told his family not to call him on their friend s behalf. They have to call his office themselves.Bush knew all too well that,  Every effort will be made to find some phone call, some inquiry, some letter that can be made to appear improper. Here s the full letter via Twitter.pic.twitter.com/60GKf4QIIJ  Eric Lipton (@EricLiptonNYT) December 21, 2016Donald Trump, however, is influenced by his business and since his children are deeply involved in the company, that means they ll have special access to him and will be able to curry favors such as asking him to gut certain regulations or asking him to call certain foreign leaders to push through business deals.That s a serious ethics violation that cannot be tolerated. Hell, Eric Trump has already been busted trying to sell access to his father in exchange for $1 million donations to his fraudulent charity. So it s pretty clear that there is already a pay-for-play scandal brewing before Trump has even taken office.This needs to stop now and the only way it will stop is if Trump sells his company or puts it into a blind trust. Anything less is unacceptable.Featured Image: Wikimedia",News,"December 24, 2016"

190, Melania Trump Hit With SERIOUS Side-Eye After Telling Black Kids To Respect Each Other,"If you haven t noticed, no one associated with the Trump administration (including The Donald s mail-order bride) has any respect for people who aren t white fake Christians.Naturally, people thought it was a bit odd when Melania Trump announced she would be visiting schools to tell kids to be nicer to each other   you know, since her husband spends the majority of his time treating black people, Latino(s)s, and pretty much everyone conservatives hate en masse, like trash.Donald Trump accuses African-Americans of racism three times more than he does whites and pushes dangerous lies originating with Nazi groups about black crime rates.During her visit to Orchard Lake Middle School  in the suburbs of Detroit, Melania told kids to  make sure everyone feels included    a strange statement considering her husband s attempts to ban Muslims from entering the country, his attacks on African-Americans, and his decision to build a wall to keep Mexicans (whom he calls  rapists  and  drug dealers ) from coming into the United States.

6522, It’s Now Official: Democrats Are Beginning To Vote On Doing Away With Superdelegates,"Democrats in the state of Maine appear to be on board with a sentiment that s been floated around by a lot of progressive voters and media personalities in 2016. They are now going to be voting on whether or not to do away with having superdelegates be involved in their primary process starting in 2020.State Rep. Diane Russell introduced the rule. Russel gave comment to the Bangor Daily News, saying: We have a system of government where you have one person, one vote, by and large. The primary system is not when that happens. And I think that we need to start moving toward a system that s more fair, that s more democratic and more reflective of the popular vote. Russell s amendment would change things in the state to where all delegates   including people who are currently superdelegates   were awarded proportionately based on the caucus results of the state.Complaints about the superdelegate aspect to the Democratic primaries have arisen in many election years, but in 2016 they ve been particularly strong due to the fact that there is a perception they are having a disproportionate effect on the primary voting process.As more voters have become aware of the concept of superdelegates, and the fact that they are unelected individuals many of whom are not known to the public and don t necessarily have to represent the people s will  there has been increasing push-back towards the idea of the  progressive  party having what many are calling a partial rigging of primary elections.This issue goes well beyond just the 2016 election. Some voters see the superdelegate issue as a party establishment that is increasingly out of touch with it s voter base, following a recent history of extremely questionable moves made by DNC leadership which are more Republican than Democratic.Rep. Russell is also including a non-binding but  strongly suggested  statement with the rule that Maine delegates vote proportionately in 2016 to better reflect the popular vote results. She chose not to include a mandatory change for 2016, because it would put Maine out of compliance with the rules set by the Democratic National Committee.Featured image via Flickr",News,"May 5, 2016"
8669, Racist Cop Suspended After Telling People To Run Over ‘Idiot’ Black Folks (SCREENSHOTS/VIDEO),"A police sergeant in St. Paul, Minnesota is enjoying a paid vacation has been placed on leave after a concerned citizen brought some of his more unsavory actions to the attention of Internal Affairs   specifically, suggesting that people run down Black Lives Matter protesters with their cars because, he says, they will get away with it.Andrew Henderson, a co-administrator of Minnesota Cop Block, first noticed Sgt. Jeffrey M. Rotheker posting under the name JM Roth on the cop watcher group s Facebook page. In fact, he explained while making his report to Internal Affairs, Rotheker was a regular dissenter. But one remark on an article about Black Lives Matter protesters stopping traffic went too far, prompting Henderson to take action. Run them over. Keep traffic flowing and don t slow down for any of these idiots who try and block the street,  Rotheker advised his fellow Facebookers. He explained that they should  continue to drive and if you hit someone make sure you call 911 to report the accident and meet the cops a block or two away.  Rotheker says that the stop farther away can be justified because  you feared for your safety since in the past people in this group has shown [sic] a propensity towards violence. Since they are trying to block the street and/or cross where there is no crossing you should not be charged with anything,  he added, explaining that even if  these idiots  attempted to sue you in civil court,  remember that it will be jury trial and so most likely it will come out in your favor. Henderson provided evidence to Internal Affairs that  JM Roth  is actually Rotheker. You know, a police officer shouldn t be advising people to run over other people for just standing in the road. That s not reasonable to me,  Henderson tells Internal Affairs investigators in a recording he made of the encounter.  I don t know if that s reasonable to you.   It wouldn t be reasonable to, I would think any person, any decent person, Sgt. John Wuorinen replies. Police Chief Thomas Smith says that the allegations are  of grave concern  given the then-upcoming Martin Luther King Day protest. In a statement the police department announced an investigation is underway and   swift, strong and decisive disciplinary action will be taken  if it is proven that Rotheker made the comments. The statement (posted) is offensive, disappointing, concerning and does not reflect in any way   or align with   the views, values and practices of the St. Paul Police Department,  the statement reads.Unfortunately, Rotheker s suggestion is uncomfortably close to reality. In 2014, a St. Paul man struck a 16-year-old protester in Minneapolis who was speaking out about Michael Brown s murder, breaking the teen girl s leg. He paid a $575 fine and was ordered to complete a traffic education course. No jail time was served. Jeffrey Patrick Rice claimed that he was attempting to  flee a mob  that  damaged his car.

15090,NOT KIDDING: Why Government Is Forcing Manhattan Landlord To Give $3200 A Month Apartment To Immigrant Free For Life,"Thanks to our government, the land of opportunity has taken on a whole new meaning An immigrant cabby scored the deal of a lifetime   a Chelsea pad for free until he dies   thanks to an obscure provision in the city s rent-stabilization law.TLC-licensed driver Oltimdje Ouattara hit the apartment jackpot after he began renting a room for $48 a night at an illegal hostel called the Chelsea Highline Hotel at 184 11th Ave. in August.Ouattara learned that since the building was registered with the city for single-room occupancy, he just had to submit a written request to become a permanent tenant there   and his  rent  would be locked in for life.It s the same legal loophole that had been used by five other hacks in the building before him. As The Post has exclusively reported, the other cabbies landed deals requiring them to pay around $300 a month for apartments that can go for up to $3,200.But Ouattara was able to net an even sweeter deal   allowing him to pay absolutely nothing   because the official listed rate on his illegal room was  $0.  And a judge said that s what the rent for his assigned room, No. 201, would stay.Ouattara has been sharing a one-room apartment in The Bronx with five other people since the hostel manager locked him out.Manhattan Housing Court Justice Sabrina Kraus appeared to be furious at the Chelsea landlord. She said the landlord should have been  well aware of [his] obligations  because he had lost a nearly identical case brought by Ouattara s neighbor, Hamidou Guira, weeks earlier.Ouattara managed to slip his lease request in just before building owner Chelsea Skybox LLC closed down the hostel, ensuring others can t follow suit.Lawyers for Chelsea Skybox LLC, which is controlled by Israeli developer John Leitersdorf and his partner, John Jacobsen, did not return messages seeking comment.But they have filed a lawsuit against Ouattara, the city and the state, claiming the housing laws are  unconstitutional  and  tantamount to taking property without due process.

4560, Seth MacFarlane Just Told Johnson And Stein Supporters EXACTLY What They Need To Hear (TWEET),"In a perfect democracy, there would be multiple viable parties to choose candidates from. Each one would have to work hard and strive for our vote, and each one would have an equal chance at winning. Unfortunately, because of the way election laws and funding are currently in the United States, we re pretty much stuck with a two-party system and any third-party vote goes to help one of the two major parties.Think Ralph Nader in 2000 and how his votes in Florida gave us George W. Bush. Well, Nader and the Supreme Court.It s imperfect, but until laws are changed, it is what it is. No amount of whining or sitting elections out is going to change that. What we need are legislators willing to change the laws, but that s never going to happen if people keep having hissy fits.This year s election is so critical not just for the nation, but the entire world. A Donald Trump presidency would be catastrophic on so many levels, both with domestic and foreign policy.Reminding everyone how important this election is, and how a third-party vote will give us a President Trump, is none other than the legendary writer/producer and creator of Family Guy, Seth MacFarlane.MacFarlane tweeted: Remember: This November you can help elect President Donald Trump just by voting for Gary Johnson or Jill Stein!

No, of course not. However, it needs to be brought to people s attention that their vote for a third party isn t actually going to put their candidate into office, but rather have the possibility of ushering in the apocalypse with Trump.A  conscience vote  does not do anyone any good with a Fascist in the White House, and it goes much deeper than just feeling good about yourself on election day.So, do what you do. That s your freedom to do so, but remember the unintended consequences of that vote and what will be in store for the entire world.Featured Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images",News,"September 19, 2016"
312, Democrat Takes Trump To The Woodshed In Fiery Speech Defending NFL (VIDEO),"Donald Trump is getting absolutely hammered for his recent attacks on NFL players who refuse to stand during the National Anthem in a stand against social injustice. Trump has tried his hardest to pass off those attacks as a defense of patriotism, but most Americans know that Trump is simply trying to mask what are obviously remarks fueled by his own racism   and one Democrat is calling him out for it.Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., blasted Trump on the House floor on Monday and attacked the undeserving POTUS for his pathetic attacks on athletes such as Stephen Curry, Lebron James and the NFL players. In his powerful, fiery speech, Jeffries asked the question that most of us would like to know:  How dare Donald lecture us on what s patriotic?!

In an interview with CNN, Jeffries called Trump a  racial arsonist  and stated that Trump was causing controversy just to keep his dwindling conservative fan base happy and engaged. Jeffries said: He uses race to advance his own ends. We couldn t have said it better. It is no coincidence that Trump s fan base are practically just white supremacists   who he has repeatedly failed to denounce because he doesn t want to lost the only support he has left. Trump knows that his fans are losing interest and patience after all of his broken campaign promises, so he creates these  scandals  and spews nonsense to distract everyone and remind his racist fans why they voted for him in the first place.

18707,HILLARY GIVES HILARIOUS Reason For Losing Election: “I Was On The Way To Winning” [VIDEO],"The Media Research Center recently published a study showing that 91% of the coverage Donald Trump received during his campaign was considered negative or  hostile .Was it even necessary to prove that almost all of candidate Trump s media coverage was negative or  hostile  compared to Hillary Clinton s?  For the most part, the media mocked anyone who even suggested Hillary had a part in the Benghazi attack that took the lives of 4 innocent Americans. They ignored and even laughed at the brave victims who came forward and publicly accused Hillary of  enabling  her sexual predator husband, while referring to her as a  champion of women and girls . The media did everything in their power to push Hillary s email scandal to the bottom of the news pile, but were finally forced to address it when FBI Director James Comey came forward and announced his investigation into her unsecured email server that was being used for official State Department business.After several months of keeping a pretty low profile, Hillary is coming out with excuses about why she lost the election. The timing is a bit suspicious however after an inside account of Hillary s disastrous campaign was just released by an insider who wrote a tell-all book titled  Shattered  that offers a less than charitable view of the real Hillary Clinton.Watch Hillary in her latest video, as she hilariously blames the press for losing the election:Here s the second part of Hillary s appearance where she tells the crowd she was on her  way to victory  until FBI Director James Comey ruined it for her:Politico   In addition to receiving far more network coverage, the networks spent far more airtime focusing on the personal controversies involving Trump, such as his treatment of women, than controversies surrounding Clinton, such as her email practices or the Clinton Foundation.For the study, MRC analyzed all 588 evening news stories that either discussed or mentioned the presidential campaign on the ABC, CBS and NBC evening newscasts from July 29 through October 20 (including weekends). Of the total newscasts, the networks devoted 29 percent of their time to the campaign. The study did not include comments from the campaigns or candidates themselves, instead focusing on what the correspondents, anchors, expert commentators, and voters on the street said in order to try and hone in on any sort of slant from the networks.Though neither candidate was necessarily celebrated, Clinton largely just stayed out of the line of fire. Even when they were critical of Hillary Clinton   for concealing her pneumonia, for example, or mischaracterizing the FBI investigation of her e-mail server   network reporters always maintained a respectful tone in their coverage,  the study found.  This was not the case with Trump, who was slammed as embodying  the politics of fear,  or a  dangerous  and  vulgar   misogynistic bully  who had insulted vast swaths of the American electorate. It doesn t really surprise me, I think most people got the sense that this was a hostile place for Trump, the establishment media,  said Rich Noyes, director of research for the MRC.  I would say looking at the big picture, the Trump campaign and to a lesser extent Republicans in general wanted this to be a referendum on Obama   the Clinton campaign, the Democrats, once Trump was picked wanted this be a referendum on Donald Trump. Television news has for the past 12 weeks has been giving the Democrats the campaign they wanted. ",left-news,"May 2, 2017"
597," Trump Tries To Blame Obama For North Korea Mess, It Immediately Backfires (TWEETS)","In his current position of having a historically low approval rating and a running track record of multiple colossal failures, one would think that Donald Trump is in NO position to be criticizing others and judging his more successful predecessors on how they handled business before him. However, this didn t stop him from trying to throw former president Barack Obama under the bus last night as he tried to distract America from focusing on his Russia scandal and the shortcomings of his administration.On Wednesday night, Trump retweeted two tweets that blamed Obama for the current North Korean crisis, which Trump has recently f*cked up beyond belief by threatening the regime with nuclear attacks. Those tweets were from John Bolton and Fox News   The Five , which of course were anti-Obama and patting Trump on the back for being an  unpredictable  basket case on the North Korea situation. Here are the tweets:Trump seriously cannot stand how loved Obama is by Americans, and tries to tear him down every chance he gets. Obama has a track record and popularity that Trump will never achieve, and he can t stand it. He only knows how to cope by blaming Obama for his own failures.The reason we re currently in crisis is because of Trump and his erratic threats to North Korea. Obama was a measured, thoughtful leader who never would have acted so recklessly. Trump, on the other hand, nixed the idea of negotiations and went straight to threatening nuclear war. Where Obama was an adult who understood complexities, Trump is a child who acts with his emotions and insecurities.If you re disgusted by Trump trashing Obama, you re not alone.

3607," Trump Has 2 New Candidates For Secretary Of State, And They’re Worse Than Everyone Else Combined","Someone isn t happy with the current possibilities for Secretary of State and is expanding the search. Apparently, there are two new candidates, and they aren t politicians. They aren t former or current military. They aren t everyday Joes. They aren t even Wall Street execs, but they might as well be. They re Big Oil executives.And they aren t just any Big Oil execs. One is Rex Tillerson, the current CEO of ExxonMobil, and the other, Lee Raymond, is the former CEO of ExxonMobil. ExxonMobil is our biggest oil giant.How bloody fantastic is that? Putting Big Oil in charge of the Department of State, arguably the most important cabinet position there is. There could be any number of reasons for this, but Trump s insistence that we should have taken Iraq s oil is one that comes to mind.That s not very likely, though. ExxonMobil is partnered with Rosneft, Russia s state-owned oil company. So ultimately, Putin is in charge of Rosneft and ExxonMobil is Putin s partner. It could be that Trump is trying to tie us more closely to Russia, and that seems far more plausible.It s also entirely possible Trump thinks he might be able to use the Department of State to further his own business interests if he nominates a CEO, although the CEO of an oil company isn t exactly who we d think of if this were the case. Not to mention that he d be putting someone in a position that could potentially be abused for the purpose of furthering their own business interests abroad.Tillerson supports the idea of man-made climate change, and ExxonMobil s position on the Paris climate accord is favorable. However, Tillerson also made more than $25 million last year, so there s another wealthy business insider to build that levee on Trump s swamp higher so it floods, rather than drains.Trump kicked off his victory tour today by saying  America first,  in an Indiana speech. Perhaps he s deluded himself into thinking that expanding his search for a Secretary of State to Big Oil executives is exactly that. However, it doesn t really mesh well with what everyday Americans thought he meant when he said,  America first.  It smacks of serious cronyism.Filling his cabinet with wealthy Wall Street financiers, CEOs, and Washington insiders is the polar opposite of what he campaigned on. There s no telling what an ExxonMobil CEO would do as Secretary of State. There s no telling whether he d even be able to do the job. Trump is either continuing to serve his own ends, curry favor somewhere, or he really is completely clueless.Watch a short report from Rachel Maddow on this below:MSNBC has learned that Donald Trump has expanded his secretary of state search to Exxon executives. https://t.co/QsxL5PG8Bq  Maddow Blog (@MaddowBlog) December 2, 2016Featured image via screen capture from embedded video",News,"December 1, 2016"
4351, BUSTED: Trump Took Millions Of Dollars From Saudi Arabia Despite Saying He Would ‘Never’ Accept Their Money,"Remember when Fox host Sean Hannity directly asked Donald Trump if he would ever accept money from a country like Saudi Arabia that treats women, Christians, and Jews like shit and he said he wouldn t?Hannity began by claiming that the Clinton Foundation accepted $25 million from the Saudi Arabian government and Trump has repeatedly demanded that the charity give the money back.But Trump nor Hannity have any proof of their claim. And Politifact could not find any evidence that Hillary Clinton personally solicited funds from the Saudis. Saudi Arabia did donate at least $10 million to the foundation to contribute to the building of the Clinton presidential library, but the Saudis also donated the same amount toward building the George H. W. Bush library.Politifact further noted that the Saudi government never donated any money to the foundation while Hillary Clinton served as Secretary of State, thus undermining Trump s accusations that Hillary was involved in a pay-to-play scheme with Saudi Arabia.But while Trump whined about the Clinton Foundation s relationship with the Saudis, he told Hannity that he wouldn t take money from them.Here s the video via YouTube just to jog your memory.Well, it turns out that Trump lied.Back in 2001, the Republican nominee did big business with Saudi Arabia and had absolutely no problem doing so.According to the New York Daily News,Trump sold the 45th floor of Trump World Tower to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for $4.5 million The five apartments included 10 bedrooms and 13 bathrooms at the time of the sale, and had yearly common charges of $85,585 for building amenities If those common charges remain the same, Trump was paid at least $5.7 million by the Saudi government since 2001.So while Trump attacks Hillary over donations made to the Clinton Foundation, he has literally been doing business with the Saudi government and taking millions of dollars from them since 2001.This is yet another example of how Trump doesn t practice what he preaches to his conservative fans.It s been revealed that Trump tried to do business with Fidel Castro s Cuba in direct violation of the embargo that has been in place for decades in response to Cuba s human rights record. Trump also does business with China by purchasing steel and other metals from companies there instead of companies in the United States, thus helping China topple American companies while screwing over American workers. Trump also furnishes his hotels with goods not made in the USA and even offers Qurans to any guest who requests one despite bashing Islam on the campaign trail.In short, Donald Trump is a lying hypocrite as usual.Featured Image: Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"October 5, 2016"

22352,"Trump Transition: As Secretary of State, Tulsi Gabbard offers potential for peace with Syria, Russia","Patrick Henningsen 21st Century WireSo far as world peace and prosperity goes, most of the names currently being kicked around for America s top diplomatic position do not inspire a great deal of confidence. It s easy to feel uneasy when you see recycled neoconservative hawks like John Bolton and Rudy Giuliani, or old hands like Mitt Romney who previously stated that  Russia is America s greatest threat.   As far as potential picks go for Secretary of State, none is more interesting than the potential that Democratic Congresswoman  Tulsi Gabbard brings to the table. President-Elect Donald Trump invited Hawaii s Gabbard to New York City this week for a meeting regarding possible involvement in the new Presidential Administration. She s got a lot going for her   as an Iraq War veteran with deep understanding of the perils of US interventions overseas, she also brings with her some common sense geopolitical context  a refreshing change from the off-the-shelf, neoliberal interventionist juggernaut previously driven by the hawkish Hillary Clinton, or the flippant public tirades and baseless insults leveled at Russia by the likes of Samantha Power.With an apparently more experienced Romney ahead of her in the queue, Gabbard is certainly a long shot, but considering the mess left behind by eight years of clandestine free for-all and the chronic absent-minded Obama era interventionist policy blunders, not to mention (but we will) the hysterical public meltdowns by US State Dept spokespersons like John Kirby, Jen Psaki and Marie Harf   you can t help but consider the fresh approach that someone like Gabbard might offer.Gabbard (photo, left) also understands the dangers posed by salafist and Wahabi extremists like ISIS, and most certainly would push back against the Obama Administration and the CIA s dubious (and technically illegal, by way of US and international law) policy of arming and supporting various and sundry moderate rebel  extremists (terrorists) in Syria   like Al Nusra Front, Arar al Sham, Nour al-din al-Zenki and many others   all favored by western covert subterfuge teams as instruments of  regime change  in Syria.In terms of independence, Gabbard has already made it clear that her stint would not involve capitulating to her GOP cabinet cohorts, adding that if she was to disagree with President Trump,  I will not hesitate to express that disagreement. Previously, Gabbard was Vice Chair of the Democratic National Committee (DNC), but suddenly resigned earlier this year in protest after pointing out her party s unfair favoring of Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders during their party s primaries. Following the Wikileaks disclosures, it turns out that Gabbard was on the right side of history, while her detractors in the DNC leadership hierarchy like Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman-Schultz (forced to resign over the Sanders affair was exposed) and Donna Brazile (caught cheating with CNN by passing questions to the Clinton campaign) ended up on the wrong side of history. Here we can see a positive pattern emerging for Gabbard, and it gets better.SEE ALSO: Trump s Foreign Policy: Russia, Syria, Iran and Cabinet NeoconsRegarding foreign policy, Gabbard s stance on Syria is remarkable, and holds great potential for a resolution to the 5 year conflict (not a civil war), as well as a chance to make positive inroads with Russia and other countries who have been perennial foes of both the Obama and Bush Administrations. Because of this, Gabbard has many enemies from on both the Republicans and Democratic chambers alike. Washington, with all of its untoward influence from the cartel of military defense contractor giants, and foreign lobbies like Israel and Saudi Arabia, will not go quietly overnight.In a major departure from the abject failure of the Obama-Clinton-Kerry proxy war debacle in Syria, Gabbard said this about her alignment with Trump policy objectives and diffusing a tense situation in Syria: However, I believe we can disagree, even strongly, but still come together on issues that matter to the American people and affect their daily lives. We cannot allow continued divisiveness to destroy our country  I shared with him my grave concerns that escalating the war in Syria by implementing a so-called no fly/safe zone would be disastrous for the Syrian people, our country and the world,  she said.  It would lead to more death and suffering, exacerbate the refugee crisis, strengthen ISIS and al-Qaeda and bring us into a direct conflict with Russia, which could result in a nuclear war. We discussed my bill to end our country s illegal war to overthrow the Syrian government and the need to focus our precious resources on rebuilding our own country and on defeating al-Qaeda, ISIS and other terrorist groups who pose a threat to the American people. Critics have remarked about her young age (35 years old) and lack of political experience. However, consider how much experience both of the previous Secretary of States had in John Kerry and Hillary Clinton   and yet, they have presided over one unmitigated foreign policy disaster after another, whether in Libya, Syria, Yemen or the Ukraine. Quite possibly, history will look back on these two Obama appointees as the worst ever Secretary of States to hold that position. This is no exaggeration when you pause and take a sober look around the Middle East today.Aside from the novelty of her relative youth in relation to typically older diplomats, Gabbard s authenticity and character comes across in her public speaking, and thus she could be very effective, and no doubt very popular internationally. She s also gone against the party line on Syria. Once again, there she is on the right side of history, while her more experienced party leaders are on stuck on the wrong side. While boldly challenging the party line won t win you any favors in the partisan cesspool of the DC swamp, it shows the sort of character required to lead a team for successful bilateral consensus-building at the international negotiations table. In terms of the US public relations image internationally, this is an intangible benefit that you simply cannot put a price on, because right now, Washington s chief priority should be mending some of the serious rifts left behind by a previously derelict State Dept. Gabbard has the potential to paint US diplomacy in an entirely new light, and a positive one at that. The biggest mistake a Trump White House could make is to place a neoconservative, or hawkish Secretary in place who might help to reboot talking up a war with Iran, or use NATO to press against Russia at its doorstep.So the real question should not be about Gabbard s relative experience, but rather can she be what the previous Secretaries could not   a diplomat.It s a long shot, but she has the potential to mend a fractured Middle East and also revamp relations with Russia   which means a more peaceful and stable world. Not a bad a thought.More from the Trump Transition Team . Shushannah Walshe ABCDemocratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, a high-profile Bernie Sanders supporter during the Democratic primaries, is  under serious consideration  for various Cabinet positions in President-elect Donald Trump s administration, according to a senior official on the transition team.According to the official, the 35-year-old Hawaii congresswoman is being looked as a candidate for secretary of state, secretary of defense or United Nations ambassador. If selected, Gabbard will be the first woman as well as the youngest pick for Trump s Cabinet.She met with him this morning in his New York City offices at Trump Tower. The Trump transition source said that their sit-down was a  terrific meeting  and that the Trump team sees her as very impressive.Gabbard, a progressive Democrat, has bucked her party in Congress and during the contentious Democratic primaries. In February she left her position as vice chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee to support Sanders. In the House she has broken with Democrats on the Syrian civil war (she supports keeping President Bashar al-Assad in power) and Syrian refugees (she voted for a GOP bill last year to conduct stricter background checks on refugees).This afternoon she released a long statement on her meeting with Trump, saying he asked to meet with her about  our current policies regarding Syria, our fight against terrorist groups like al-Qaeda and ISIS, as well as other foreign policy challenges we face.  She said they had a  frank and positive conversation in which we discussed a variety of foreign policy issues in depth.

6797, Washed Up Crazy Singer Accuses Saturday Night Live Of Worshipping Satan,"Right-ing paranoid whackjob Pat Boone has declared SNL is now venerating Satan, because of a parody skit they ran called  God is a Boob Man.  The skit was making some light-hearted humor at recent attempts to pass anti-LGBT laws in many states. The skit is absolutely hilarious and is a parody of other recent Christian movie trailers for such films as  God s not dead. It isn t clear how Boone saw the skit since he clearly hates SNL and shouldn t be watching it as a result. Perhaps he watches it just to get outraged. He certainly did get upset, though, when he took it upon himself to Godsplain God to the rest of us:God is not thin-skinned. But he does demand reverence. If you have any brains at all you don t pitch yourself against someone who created all things, the God of the Bible. They don t have to apologize to Christians [but] when you come against God and the Holy Spirit who are one and the same, you are bringing upon yourself eternal condemnation. Source: Right Wing WatchBoone went on to not only accuse SNL of being supporters of Satan, but he also outed SNL as a secret Jew-hating enterprise as well: Something can be devilishly funny, but this skit is diabolical. God has only one real enemy   Satan. Satan ridicules faith, and they re taking Satan s side. They re also ridiculing me and the film, telling impressionable young people not to see it because it s ridiculous. Then they throw in that the lawyer is Jewish to make the Christian look even worse, but it s just anti-Semitic. Source: Fox NewsYeah, he sure nailed it. Saturday Night Live is secretly anti-Jew. Just think about how stupid that sounds for a few moments.Then, to prove that he s a couple cans short of a six-pack, Boone said he didn t feel that SNL needed to apologize to Christians  followed a few moments later by him demanding that SNL apologizes to Christians. He literally real-time flip-flopped.Boone even went so far as to suggest that gay people should be offended at SNL for being  portrayed as more bigoted than Christians.  Notice he said  more  bigoted. He literally admitted that Christians like him are bigoted, by using the word  more. As if this wasn t embarrassing enough, the producer of  God s Not Dead 2,  (they actually made 2 of these?) Michael Scott, also complained that SNL is not portraying his movie  accurately  proving that he has absolutely NO CLUE how parody or satire works.Scott also chimed in with another incredibly funny comment, saying that parody like the SNL skit  goes too far  and  can cause divisions  among us.Really? Anti-LGBT/Pro-discrimination law doesn t go too far, and bigoted irrational hate doesn t cause divisions. But, a parody skit on SNL is the great doom of humanity.

David Brumbaugh excused passing the bill by claiming that God will fix the state s crumbling economy and pay all the legal expenses resulting from forthcoming lawsuits if they do the  moral  thing and ban abortion. Everybody talks about this $1.3 billion deficit,  Brumbaugh said on Thursday.  If we take care of the morality, God will take care of the economy. I ve heard almost every argument today about judicial challenge to this legislation and after much prayer and study, I ask myself this question,  he continued.  Do we make laws because they re moral and right, or do we make them based on what an unelected judicial occupant might question or overturn? No, Rep. Brumbaugh. We make laws in this country based on the Constitution and the Supreme Court has ruled that the 14th Amendment prohibits banning women from making private choices regarding their own bodies, and that includes the right to choose to have an abortion.But if SB1552 passes in Oklahoma, women across that state will no longer get a choice because the bill makes it a law that doctors who perform an abortion other than for a woman who has suffered a miscarriage or their life is in danger to have their license revoked. In short, women would not even be able to get an abortion within the first 13 weeks of pregnancy when 90 percent of abortions occur because doctors would be faced with having their license to practice medicine taken away from them. Basically, Republicans are trying to ban abortion by punishing doctors who perform the procedure.Brumbaugh went on to compare abortion to slavery and then scoffed at the fact that the bill is unconstitutional. Don t let people tell you,  Unconstitutional arguments, Roe v. Wade,  all this,  he said.Once again, a Republican insanely believes that passing certain legislation will please God enough that all of our problems will be magically fixed. Taxpayers in Oklahoma should be outraged that one of their own representatives is trying to dupe them in this way to excuse a bill that would strip millions of women of their reproductive rights.Featured Image: YouTube",News,"April 23, 2016"
7737, This Ted Cruz ‘Bad Lip Reading’ Is Everything You Never Knew You Wanted And More (VIDEO),"With the Republican side of this presidential race turning out to be the most horrifically embarrassing thing that has ever happened in the history of the republic, it s good to enjoy some comic relief from time to time to take your mind off of how awful things really are. With Donald Trump in the lead for GOP nominee and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) not far behind, one has to wonder if the Republican party has gone and lost their ever-loving mind.To provide some much-needed comic relief is none other than the folks over at Bad Lip Reading. They ve been putting hilarious words into the mouths of athletes, celebrities and politicians for some time now, and now in what may be their best  bad lip reading  yet, they ve gone after Captain Smarmy himself, Ted Cruz.Usually, when watching a BLR it will be mostly gibberish and you will laugh at how closely the words match up to who they are parodying. However, this time around, there s a full story-line and it is absolutely spot on. From putting the words into Cruz s mouth, to his wife s, to his children s to those he s met along the campaign trail. Although, in true BLR form, they did give Cruz a new campaign slogan: I Need a Bogel for the Glotch. Knowing Cruz, though, it might be something he d actually say to pander to Bogel and Glotch makers.

365, Trump Supporters At ‘Mother Of All Rallies’ MASSIVELY Outnumbered By Marching Juggalos,"Saturday, September 16th, 2017 will surely go down as the strangest day for rallies in our nation s capital since at least January, when millions of invisible people attended Donald Trump s inauguration ceremony.Two different gatherings are taking place, quartered in different sections of the National Mall, but surely visible to one another: Trump supporters have come together to put on what they re calling the  Mother of all Rallies,  with expected attendance undoubtedly in the zillions, and a rally with an actual purpose is also taking place. Juggalos, or fans of the band Insane Clown Posse, are in D.C. to protest what they call an unfair label from the FBI and Department of Justice classifying them as a  loosely organized hybrid gang. It s clear which group has the more ardent supporters, and it isn t the one I m calling (for the purposes of this piece)  the Trumpettes. Donald Trump is known for his loyalty demands, but I m not sure he s ever met a Juggalo, because they showed up today:WASHINGTON, DC   SEPTEMBER 16: People gather for a rally during the Juggalo March at the Lincoln Memorial on the National Mall, September 16, 2017 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images)That s the Juggalos showing up. The Juggalo March, at the time of this writing, is just getting underway.This, on the other hand, is the majority of the Trump rally happening just across the way:WASHINGTON, DC   SEPTEMBER 16: Pro-Trump security forces try to keep people away on the National Mall on September 16, 2017 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images)You ll note from the captions that these two photos are both by Getty photographer Tasos Katopodis. The Trump rally began, according to the Facebook event page, at 11 AM EDT, while the Juggalo March wasn t scheduled until 2 PM Eastern.The Trumpette organizers have tried to distance themselves from the white supremacists that organized the Charlottesville, Boston, and Portland rallies held in the name of  free speech.  Unfortunately for them, they don t seem to realize that the majority of people who show up at those rallies don t care who the president is, they just want to be allowed to shout racial slurs again without fear of public reprisal.Reaction to the stark difference in attendance was widespread:""The Juggalos outnumber the white supremacists at the Lincoln Memorial today.""   is not a sentence I ever thought I'd write.

I believe we have at least 1 million Muslim eligible voters in this country. We have to register every single Muslim to vote in 2016. The Muslim vote can be the swing vote in major states,  CAIR Executive Director Nihad Awad said at the Muslim American Society (MAS) and Islamic Circle of North America (ICNA) annual conference in Chicago, according to video posted earlier this month.Awad explained that CAIR   which is prohibited from engaging in political activity due to its registration as a tax-exempt organization   would not be the vehicle by which a candidate would be endorsed. He said another organization would be set up to promote the Muslim-friendly presidential candidate.Awad urged all Muslims to register to vote and to use Islamic centers as polling stations. Turn your centers, Islamic centers, mosques into registration centers for voters, into polling stations during the election time,  he said. Via: Frontpage Mag",left-news,"Feb 3, 2016"
1484, Chris Wallace Just Shoved His Foot So Far Up Trump’s Ass It Came Out His Mouth (VIDEO),"Donald Trump may spend his time furiously tweeting that the Russia investigation   the one over which he fired FBI Director James Comey after he requested additional resources   is FAKE NEWS, while simultaneously complaining about leaks of classified information that is simultaneously FAKE NEWS and real information, but the rest of us see through his actions that not only is our alleged President hiding about a billion skeletons in his closet, but he has sold out our nation. This is, at this point, something that can be considered a truth   because even Fox News can t avoid commenting on The Donald and his administration s shady practices. When I heard that exchange today between Jeff Mason, White House reporter, and Sean Spicer speaking from the podium in the briefing room for the President of the United States, it took my breath away,  Wallace told fellow Fox host Shep Smith on Friday, adding:That was what in Watergate they called a non-denial denial. He was asked specifically, is there a recording device in the Oval Office of the President of the United States? He said,  I have nothing for you on that.  He could have said no. He could have said yes. He said I have nothing for you on that. That is a non-denial denial. Look, it may just be that the President is trolling the press corps and saying work yourself into a frenzy about this and turns out it nothing. But why would he do that? Why would he want to decrease the credibility which is already in question of this White House and comments that are made from that podium? It seems to me that you re playing a very dangerous game with the currency of the credibility of the President of the United States. Every step he s taken this week has cut into the credibility of this White House, the trust of the people inside the White House,  Wallace said,  and clearly I think the trust that the American people pay to this President and to his White House staff. I ve never seen anything like it and I find it very troubling and troubled. I just don t understand the game that they re playing,  he added.  Cause it isn t a game.

23407,"OREGON: Feds Cover-up Foul Play in Finicum Death, Feds’ Shell Casings ‘Have Gone Missing’","21st Century Wire says As it turns out, we were right about the ambush, and we were right about the cover-up. After all this, the quislings at the The Oregonian are still trying to tart-up this FBI and OSP debacle by calling it a  traffic stop . While forced to now admit that there was foul play on the infallible government s part, mainstream media gatekeepers are still trying to paint the incident as a  traffic stop    which is beyond a joke.Get ready for another government-issued  magic bullet  fairy tale to protect the hired guns.How long before we can call this an assassination? New findings by law enforcement officials suggest that an FBI agent on the scene of the fatal shooting of Bundy-affiliated protester LaVoy Finicum during a Jun. 26 felony stop might have fired two shots that were not reported, and agents on the scene might have disposed of bullet casings to cover them up.According to The Oregonian, investigators believe that the shots were fired approximately at the moment at which LaVoy Finicum was exiting his truck with his hands up, prior to when he appears to reach into his jacket and is shot by two Oregon State Police troopers. The above-embedded slow-motion video shows the moment at which investigators believe the shots were fired.Deschutes County Sheriff Shane Nelson and Malheur County District Attorney Dan Norri, who investigated the incident, concluded that the Oregon State Police officers were justified in shooting Finicum, but also announced that they believe that an FBI agent took two unreported shots and then lied about it. The U.S. Department of Justice has subsequently launched a criminal investigation into the conduct of the FBI agents on the scene.The Oregonian s Les Zaitz wrote,  A state trooper later described to investigators seeing two rifle casings in the area where the [FBI] agents were posted. Detectives tasked with collecting evidence didn t find the casings, police reports indicate. He added,  FBI aerial surveillance video shows that before the detectives could get there, the FBI agents searched the area with flashlights and then huddled, according to law enforcement sources who have seen the video. The group then broke and one agent appeared to bend over twice and pick up something near where the two shots likely were taken. Police reports indicate that detectives showed up to collect evidence around 90 minutes after the moment in the surveillance video in which the FBI agent appeared to pick items up from the ground.All of the FBI agents on the scene that day claimed that they did not take any shots. A state trooper said he had fired three shots while the truck was speeding towards police and two more at Finicum as he was reaching into his jacket after he had exited the vehicle. Police inventory records show that the trooper was missing five rounds after the incident, apparently confirming his story.A fourth bullet hole in the truck came from a different angle of trajectory suggesting that an FBI agent had fired the shot. Investigators believe a second shot, which missed Finicum and did not strike the truck, was also fired by an FBI agent Continue this story at Truth In MediaREAD MORE OREGON STANDOFF NEWS: 21st Century Wire Oregon Files",Middle-east,"March 17, 2016"
16613,WHY OBAMA’S LAWSUIT AGAINST NC Is Really About The Jack-Boot Of Government On America’s Throats,"Obama is clearly attempting to strip Americans of our right to express our opinions on social issues based on our religion or morals. Americans have found themselves in a scary place, where we are remaining silent when we know we should be speaking out, because we re afraid of being shamed by the progressive Left. Meanwhile the Left continues to blur the lines of morality, hoping that they will erase all individual thought and speech.In a communist society, the individual s best interests are indistinguishable from the society s best interest. Thus, the idea of an individual freedom is incompatible with a communist ideology. The only reason to hold individual speech and information rights would be to better the society. Some of us care little about the debate over public bathrooms. We do, however, care about the ongoing destruction of federalism, individual choice, and good-faith debate.One reliable way to quash dissent and force moral codes on others is to liken your cause to that of the civil rights fight. Every liberal issue is situated somewhere on the great historical arc of  equality  and  justice.  If a person stands against even one of these causes which were once great but are increasingly trivial they have, according to the cultural imperialists of the Obama administration, aligned themselves with the Klan. Literally.After U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced that the Department of Justice had filed a federal lawsuit to stop North Carolina from passing a  controversial law this is the go-to characterization of conservative bills that pass with healthy majorities requiring transgender people to use public bathrooms matching their birth certificate, she had this to say:This is not the first time that we have seen discriminatory responses to historic moments of progress for our nation. We saw it in the Jim Crow laws that followed the Emancipation Proclamation; we saw it in the fierce and widespread resistance to Brown v. Board of Education; and we saw it in the proliferation of state bans on same-sex unions that were intended to stifle any hope that gay and lesbian Americans might one day be afforded the right to marry.Likening a spat over biologically segregated boy/girl bathrooms to the genuine, violent, systematic, state-sponsored, society-wide bigotry that took place in this country for a century is both intellectually and morally corrupt. It s not all a continuum. Yet this administration peddles these kinds of risible comparisons in the cause of self-aggrandizement all the time. Hans Fiene has coined it Selma envy.The present situation is significantly different, and in every possible sense less dire. It is the sort of social problem generally worked out amongst people in this country without unelected civil rights commissions punishing business owners for thought crimes. Under North Carolina s law no one was stopping a private company or coffee shop or big box store from having any kind of bathroom set-up they desire. I m pretty sure most voters don t comprehend this fact when they hear the distorted coverage of these laws in the news.North Carolina and other states have preemptively moved forward with these kinds to bills to head off the state redefining gender. Too late. The fact is that the federal government can simply announce that a man can be a woman and vice versa if they choose. It then compels everyone in country to accept this reality. Yet there is no government definition of what transgendered means, other self-identification, which can mean anything.  Civil Rights  Division Chief Vanita Gupta says:  Transgender men are men.   Transgender women are women.  So sayeth Vanita Gupta, so sayeth we all. Or else. And now 300 million people have adhere to the Obama administration s relativistic notions about nature and gender.Now, from what I can gather the central anxiety of many people is not that the transgendered will take advantage of their children, but that any man can simply declare himself a woman, put on a wig, and go into a public bathroom. Maybe it s an irrational fear, maybe it s not. As a father who s had to send young daughters into busy public bathrooms, I know one thing for sure: I could not care less what Vanita Gupta has to say on the topic.In a broader sense, the suit is symbolic of the federal government s eight-year crusade to decimate any semblance of federalism and streamline progressive morality. The administration ignores state laws that conflict with federal policy when it approves and it sues states when it does not. States that pass law enforcement bills President Obama finds unsatisfactory will see the full force of the Justice Department come down on them. Those with drug legalization laws and immigration laws he does like, even if they conflict with federal law, have nothing to worry about. Whether one agrees in theory with these moves and I am liberal on drug legalization and immigration allowing Washington to selectively enforce law conflicts with the kind of republicanism that allows us to be diverse and deal with unique problems locally.For entire story: The Federalist",Government News,"May 11, 2016"
5574, One Group Of GOP Voters May Vote Blue For The First Time In 60 Years Because Of Trump,"Polls have shown for awhile that Donald Trump has a solid lead among white voters without a college education. What about those with a college education? That group tends to vote Republican in presidential elections, but it looks like Trump will lose that group of voters for the GOP for the first time in 60 years.This is huge, because it means he s not polling as well with white voters as he thinks he is. In fact, he could lose the white vote as well as every minority vote and the women s vote this year. So he might be able to keep it sort of semi-close, depending on what happens with the white vote, but His Royal Narcissism won t understand that.Since May, our wannabe Fascist-In-Chief has trailed by about six percentage points with this group, and has trailed an average of five points with the general electorate. It seems that his xenophobic policy proposals, along with his insistence that sexism and racism are just political correctness run amok and not actual problems, just don t sit well with people who are educated enough to know how to think for themselves. Education is King Donnie s number one enemy.Romney won this same group by six points in 2012. Romney also held solid leads in states that Trump is putting into play for the first time in years, if not decades. Much to the GOP s dismay, Hillary Clinton is actually competitive in states such as Georgia, Arizona, Utah and Kansas. Romney won these states by an average of 21.5 points. While we can easily expect Utah not to favor His Royal Dishonesty as much as Romney, they could actually turn blue this year because they can t stand Trump.Hillary is polling much better with this group than the Dunce-in-Chief, even though overall, they re fairly close together. It seems that the wannabe President-who-would-be-King may have to rely heavily on circumstances beyond his control to gain ground in the opinion polls again, like Obama losing popularity, an economic crisis, or Hillary getting scandalized due to another witch-hunt.That s a sucky position to be in, although our not-so-broken hearts only bleed pink carbonated peanut butter for him over this. For now, Hillary s growing popularity among white, educated voters could easily give her the presidency.Featured image by Jeff Swensen/Getty Images",News,"July 6, 2016"

16866,Want To Know Where Your Meat Comes From? Those Days Are Over,"One word China That s the only reason you should be furious with our government that s usually overreaching but not so much in this case. Because we were being penalized by the WHO, we decided to stop requiring a country of origin on meat. Just to clue you in, here s one of our articles that will make you furious that the meat labels are gone:Yuck! It s bad enough that China had a dog meat festival last week but now this! The USDA just removed the country of origin off of meat but it needs to come back ASAP! If there s meat smuggling going on you really don t know where it originated, but if it s China I would like to make the informed choice not to buy their meat for this reason:Chinese authorities have seized more than 100,000 tonnes of smuggled meat   some of it more than 40 years old, according to state media.The frozen meat, estimated to be worth about  300 million (3bn yuan; $483m), was seized in a nationwide crackdown. It was smelly and I nearly threw up when I opened the door,  an official from Hunan province, where 800 tonnes were seized, told the AFP news agency. Poor standards have made food safety a major concern in China. According to state newspaper the China Daily, officials from Guangxi, a southern region bordering Vietnam, found meat dating back to the 1970s. Thawed several times: Some of the meat seized in Hunan province was found to have been refrozen after thawing out while in transit, according to the reports. Yang Bo, an anti-smuggling official in Hunan province, was quoted as saying food was often transported in ordinary rather than refrigerated vehicles to save money.  So the meat has often thawed out several times before reaching customers,  he said. The Hunan province haul reportedly included beef, chicken feet and duck necks. Authorities believe meat is smuggled into China via neighboring Hong Kong and Vietnam, from countries such as Brazil and India, to sidestep import restrictions. WASHINGTON (AP)   It s now harder to find out where your beef or pork was born, raised and slaughtered.After more than a decade of wrangling, Congress repealed a labeling law last month that required retailers to include the animal s country of origin on packages of red meat. It s a major victory for the meat industry, which had fought the law in Congress and the courts since the early 2000s.Lawmakers said they had no choice but to get rid of the labels after the World Trade Organization repeatedly ruled against them. The WTO recently authorized Canada and Mexico, which had challenged the law, to begin more than $1 billion in economic retaliation against the United States. U.S. exporters can now breathe a sigh of relief,  said Republican Sen. Pat Roberts of Kansas, chairman of the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee. The longtime opponent of the labels helped add the repeal to a massive year-end spending bill. After the law was passed, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said the government immediately would stop requiring the labels.Consumer groups say the repeal is a disappointment just as consumers are asking for more information on their food packages. Advocates say the labels help people make more informed buying decisions and encourage purchases of American meat.Before repeal, the labels told shoppers that a particular cut of meat was  born in Canada, raised and slaughtered in the United States  or  born, raised and slaughtered in the United States.  Congress first required the labels in 2002 amid fears of mad cow disease from imported cattle. The labels weren t on most packages until 2009, though, due to delays pushed by the meat industry.Repeal became inevitable once the United States lost all its WTO appeals and the retaliation became a possibility. But the consumer groups criticized Congress for repealing the law for ground meat and pork in addition to the fresh cuts of meat that were the subject of WTO concerns.The bill was  a holiday gift to the meatpacking industry from Congress,  complained the advocacy group Food and Water Watch. Meatpackers who buy Mexican cattle were some of the law s most aggressive opponents.The repeal also was a big defeat for lawmakers from northern border states where U.S. ranchers directly compete with Canadian ranchers. Those lawmakers insisted on including the labeling in the 2002 and 2008 farm bills and this year fought to replace it with a voluntary program once the WTO rulings came down. But after years of success, this time they were not able to find enough support.Roger Johnson of the National Farmers Union, which has heavy membership in those states, said the group was  furious  about the repeal. Packers will be able to once again deliberately deceive consumers,  Johnson said.Still, there was some good news for food labeling advocates in the spending bill. Despite an aggressive push by the food industry, lawmakers decided not to add language that would have blocked mandatory labeling of genetically modified ingredients. Also, a provision by Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, would require labeling of genetically modified salmon recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration.The issue is expected to come up again in 2016, with Vermont set to require labeling on genetically modified food this summer.The day the spending bill passed, Vilsack said he would try to help Congress come up with a middle ground on labeling of engineered foods  in a way that doesn t create significant market disruption, while at the same time recognizing consumers  need to know and right to know basic information.

Brian Ross was suspended for a month. President Trump suggested should be fired for his #fakenews reporting.Congratulations to @ABC News for suspending Brian Ross for his horrendously inaccurate and dishonest report on the Russia, Russia, Russia Witch Hunt. More Networks and  papers  should do the same with their Fake News!  Donald J.

NBC picked up Kelly in a $23 million per year contract in a gamble that liberals would warm up to the formerly conservative host. NBC has since found out that conservatives no longer want anything to do with Kelly, and liberals despise her for her past performances as a top-rated host on conservative-leaning FOX News.Twitter users were on fire after Megyn Kelly did her part to help tear down President Trump (again):Megyn Kelly,You and your employer need to smear Trump but there's nothing left to accuse him of so you're going to re-interview Trump accusers who've already been proven pos liars?How desperate you must be.  Philip Schuyler (@FiveRights) December 11, 2017Today, Megyn Kelly traipsed out  a trio of Donald Trump accusers on her failing show. Rest assured, there will be many more liberal accusers who come out against Donald Trump, as racism appears to have lost its glow, as a means to draw voters into the Democrat Party, as Americans have become tired of watching Democrats constantly drawing from the bottom of the deck, as a way to cloud Trump s  Make America Great Again  agenda of a pro-growth economy, jobs, education, lower taxes, and America first.Megyn Kelly, who is desperate for ratings, must have been incredibly disappointed when breaking news of a botched suicide bomber attack in New York City was reported at the same time her Democrat Donald Trump accuser was telling her story on her show.Daily Mail A trio of the president s accusers reemerged on Monday to hound him for sexually harassing them.Samantha Holvey, Jessica Leeds and Rachel Crooks had previously made allegations against Trump and appeared on Megyn Kelly  Today  to demand justice as the White House resumed its claim that the issue had been litigated in last year s election. All of a sudden, he s all over, me, kissing and groping and groping and kissing,  said Leeds, a self-proclaimed Democrat, who says she revealed her story because  I wanted people to know what kind of a person that Trump really is what a pervert he is.

Leeds replied,  We have a problem in that we have been enculturated all of this time for all of this time, for years and years and years, to be compliant.  Leeds went on to say,  For the woman who voted for Trump, they just didn t want to vote for a woman   It became reasonably difficult to believe a single work Leeds had to say when she used the word enculturated  when referring to her alleged meeting with Donald Trump. It became impossible to believe a word she said when Leeds followed up her comment by exposing her bitter feelings towards women for not voting for Hillary.

Her show aired in other parts of the country, however, including Washington.Holvey, a former Miss USA contestant, said that Trump came backstage in 2006 and reviewed the women while they were indecent.She recalled thinking at the time that it would be a meet and great with Trump. But it wasn t.The former Miss North Carolina says Trump was  just looking me over like I was just a piece of meat. I was not a human being. I did not have a brain I did not have a personality.

14423,SENATOR MIKE LEE Nails It On Why The Senate Opposes A Supreme Court Nominee [Video],"Senator Mike Lee gives it right back to FOX s Martha MacCallum when she grilled him on why the Senate won t accept a Supreme Court nominee: MARTHA MACCALLUM (HOST): The president has laid out I think what anyone would say is a very fair set of circumstances for nominating someone, so why not give this person hearing?SEN. MIKE LEE (R-UT): OK that all sounds great. We do have to remember Martha, we re talking about a lame duck president in his final months of office who is talking about making a lifetime appointment to the highest court in the land, a court which in recent years has played an increasingly large role in the development of public policy. And we think the American people have a voice, that voice should be heard and the American people ought to be able to choose their next president and have the next president, whether that s a Republican or Democrat, make the choice.MACCALLUM: Yeah but I think, senator, with all due respect, wouldn t the American people say we elected President Obama? We also elected the senators who are currently in office, and we expect them both, on both sides to do their job. The president s job is to name a nominee, your job is to give that person a hearing and either appoint or not. Either consent, to give consent, or not. So why not go through the process? Why do you get to decide that?LEE: You re absolutely right that elections have consequences. President Obama was elected again as president in 2012. Senate elections also have consequences and when Republicans were elected to the majority in the Senate after the 2014 elections, we had an increasingly large role to play in the system. Now you re also absolutely right, the president has the right to nominate. That is his prerogative. It s also the Senate s right to decide when, whether, how, to what extent, to confirm someone and here what we re saying is, we think that it s very important to maintain a tradition, a tradition that goes all the way back to 1888 by the way. 1888 was the last time you had a Supreme Court vacancy arise during a presidential election year, and the last time that that vacancy arising during the presidential election year was filled during the same year, and confirmed by a Senate that was run by a party opposite the president s party.MACCALLUM: I think everybody listens to that and understands what you are saying and that there s   but I don t think that gets around the basic requirement to do the job, to go through the process and if you all decide that you don t want to give consent to that person, well that s absolutely your right. And just given your background and being such an adherent to the Constitution, it seems somewhat surprising I think to some people to take that attitude. And it also feeds in perhaps to the notion that people in your position don t want to   are blocking things from happening on Capitol Hill.LEE: We are blocking this from happening, make no mistake about it. We are blocking this one. And we feel it s our obligation to do so. We think that especially with this president who has overstepped his constitutional boundaries so many times   [CROSSTALK]MACCALLUM: But then why does it make it right on to do that on your side? You can look at this person and say  no thank you, we don t like this person,  but why the hesitation to have a hearing? To do the process? I think that s what people have a hard time understanding.Via: Media Matters",politics,"Feb 24, 2016"

20855,OBAMA CRITICIZES TRUMP For Comments About Illegals And Muslim Refugees…But What About THIS Video Of Obama’s Top 5 Most Violent Quotes About AMERICAN CITIZENS?,"President Obama, who as a candidate once urged supporters to  bring a gun  to the knife fight of his campaign, on Tuesday decried  vicious  rhetoric from Republican presidential candidates.Here is a great compilation of Obama s top 5 hits on his opponent (50% of America). Can you imagine the comments that haven t been recorded, like at the recent meeting with Black Lives Matter terrorists who were invited guests of Barack Obama s, coincidentally just prior to the organized Chicago Trump rally riots?During the annual  Friends of Ireland  luncheon at the U.S. Capitol, Mr. Obama told a bipartisan group of lawmakers that he is  more than a little dismayed about what s happening on the campaign trail lately. Never one to miss out on the opportunity to bash his enemies our very un-statesman like Community Organizer In Chief took the opportunity when speaking in front of the Prime Minister of Ireland to not talk about relations with Ireland, but instead, to bash Donald Trump. He made it clear to this group who has absolutely nothing to do with our elections, that he is watching his every move Trump makes and will use every opportunity, no matter how inappropriate, to damage his reputation. Probably the most sickening and dishonest part of this video is when Obama begrudgingly tells Speaker Of The House, Paul Ryan (R) that, I know you are a great father and a great husband  and that, We can have political debates without turning on each other  at the 7:45 mark: We have heard vulgar and divisive rhetoric aimed at women and minorities   at Americans who don t look like  us,  or pray like  us  or vote like we do,  Mr. Obama said in an obvious reference to Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump.  We ve seen misguided attempts to shut down that speech, however offensive it may be. In response to those attempts, we ve seen actual violence, and we ve heard silence from too many of our leaders. As he has increasingly in recent days, Mr. Obama lamented  any effort to spread fear or encourage violence, or to shut people down when they re trying to speak, or turn Americans against one another. As a citizen who will still be leading this office, I will not support somebody who practices that kind of politics,  the president said.But as a candidate for the White House in 2008, Mr. Obama was no stranger to violent rhetoric. He encouraged the notion that he was a product of Chicago s particularly tough brand of politics.At a campaign event in Philadelphia in June 2008, Mr. Obama told supporters,  If they bring a knife to the fight, we bring a gun. Because from what I understand, folks in Philly like a good brawl. I ve seen Eagles fans. Later that year, as polls showed a close race between Mr. Obama and Republican nominee John McCain, Mr. Obama urged a crowd of about 1,500 at a campaign rally in Elko, Nevada, to get confrontational in their community for him. I need you to go out and talk to your friends and talk to your neighbors,  Mr. Obama said.  I want you to talk to them whether they are independent or whether they are Republican. I want you to argue with them and get in their face. The president on Tuesday seemed to be referring to such comments of his own when he remarked,  All of us can recall some intemperate words that we regret. Certainly, I can. And while some may be more to blame than others for the current climate, all of us are responsible for reversing it. Via: Washington Times",left-news,"Mar 18, 2016"
8664, You Won’t Believe What Rubio Said About The Flint Michigan Water Contamination Crisis (VIDEO),"We all know the GOP is out of touch with the public, but when there s a major crisis unfolding in the United States, one would expect even the Republicans, especially presidential candidates, to keep up to date with what s happening. Not so with Marco Rubio. When asked about the lead contamination crisis in Flint, Michigan, Marco Rubio said that he has not  been focusing  on it.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi77s6CjZRE]The contamination has left tens of thousands of residents without drinking water and the lead in the water may have caused irreversible damage to many more who have been drinking it. Yet, Senator Rubio did not feel that it was important to read up on the issue. Rubio said: I d love to give you a better answer on it. It s just not an issue we ve been quite frankly fully briefed or apprised of in terms of the role the governor has played and the state has played in Michigan on these sorts of issues. Rubio continued, saying that he s unable to give: A deeply detailed answer on what the right approach should be, other than to tell you that in general I believe the federal government s role in some of these things [is] largely limited unless it involves a federal jurisdictional issue. Whether he thinks the federal government s role is limited doesn t mean he shouldn t pay attention to a crisis affecting tens of thousands of Americans and especially when Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder (R) asked the Obama Administration to declare a state of emergency and send millions of dollars to help alleviate the situation.It s not just Rubio who s been both silent and ignorant on the issue. Other Republicans haven t commented on or mentioned the tragedy at all. However, both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have condemned the negligence that led to the crisis, not only framing it as a health problem, but one that is a racial justice issue. Clinton said: I think every single American should be outraged. We had a city in the United States of America where the population, which is poor in many ways, and majority-African American, has been drinking and bathing in lead-contaminated water. And the governor of that state acted as though he didn t really care. He had requests for help that he basically stonewalled. I ll tell you what: if the kids in a rich suburb of Detroit had been drinking contaminated water and being bathed in it, there would have been action. Gov. Snyder, who s a Republican just like Rubio, is facing a class action lawsuit from Flint residents.Sen. Bernie Sanders  added that he thinks Gov. Snyder should resign:  There are no excuses. The governor long ago knew about the lead in Flint s water. He did nothing. As a result, hundreds of children were poisoned. Thousands may have been exposed to potential brain damage from lead. Gov. Snyder should resign. Officials fear that some children in Flint who drank and bathed in the water may have brain damage and other long term health problems. Yet, Rubio and the Republicans don t see the importance of addressing and taking the initiative on an unflolding tragedy in an American city.Featured image via YouTube screenshot",News,"January 19, 2016"
17840,HOLLYWOOD HYPOCRITES MATT DAMON and RUSSELL CROWE Reportedly Helped Kill NYT’s Story That Could Have Exposed Harvey Weinstein 13 Years Ago,"The hypocrisy of the Hollywood elites who would hide the truth about a sexual predator is beyond the pale If I had a bucket list, I d say raising my four girls to be strong, good women would be number one.  -Matt Damon, 2010 interviewReally Matt? What about the chance that you allegedly had in 2004 to save untold numbers of women from being victims of the disgusting Hollywood kingpin and billionaire Harvey Weinstein?Though the New York Times has been widely celebrated for its article exposing decades of sexual-harassment accusations against Harvey Weinstein, one journalist claims the paper sat on an earlier article detailing the producer s misconduct. Sharon Waxman, founder of the Wrap, writes that her own investigate reporting, which took her on an international trip to uncover rumors of Weinstein s sexual misconduct, was cut from the Times in 2004 under pressure from several Hollywood elites. Waxman alleges in the Wrap that Matt Damon and Russell Crowe called her  directly  to dispel the reports she was following about Miramax s Italian head Fabrizio Lombardo, who was allegedly hired  to take care of Weinstein s women needs.  She says that because of their influence, and interference from Weinstein, whose company was a big advertiser in the Times, the article was edited to remove the more salacious details. Damon and Crowe had previously worked with Weinstein on pictures like Good Will Hunting, Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World, and Cinderella Man.Waxman claims that the gutted story could have exposed Weinstein much earlier.  I had people on the record telling me Lombardo knew nothing about film, and others citing evenings he organized with Russian escorts,  Waxman said. She also alleges that she tracked down an intern in London who had been paid off in a settlement with Weinstein.  I was devastated after traveling to two countries and overcoming immense challenges to confirm at least part of the story that wound up running last week, more than a decade later,  she writes.

4057, Obama Says Blame The Donald: Trump Is Such An A**hole That Michelle HAD To Hit The Campaign Trail,"Michelle Obama is arguably the strongest weapon Hillary Clinton s campaign has when it comes to fighting Donald Trump. And according to President Obama, the GOP nominee has no one but himself to thank for her presence on the campaign trail.Speaking at a fundraiser for Clinton in California on Monday, Obama said there is one force driving the first lady to fight tooth and nail for Clinton: The possibility of a Trump presidency. Some of you may be aware of the fact that Michelle does not really love politics,  Obama said.  But the passion that she s brought to campaigning this time speaks to the degree that this election is different, the choice is different. Obama said that when he was running against Sen. john McCain in 2008 and Mitt Romney in 2012, he disagreed with them about many, many things. But despite that, he still considered them to be  honorable people. I wasn t concerned about the Republic if they had won,  Obama said.  And so part of the reason Michelle is working the way she is, is because she understands, as I understand, that some more fundamental values are at stake in this election. It has to do with our basic standards of decency   how do we treat people. The president said that for the FLOTUS, the choices we are faced with in the 2016 election can be boiled down to this: Do we treat people who are of a different faith as part of the fabric of America, or do we label them as something foreign, not a  real American,  and thereby subject to different standards when it comes to how our laws apply? And this:  Do we think of women as equal and full citizens, capable of doing anything, or do we think of them as objects of either scorn or lust or our own satisfactions? Do we think that government is something serious, that we have an obligation to make sure that to the best of our abilities we leave the country a little bit better off than how we found it, or do we think that it s an infomercial or a reality TV show,  Obama continued.All of this has made one thing very clear to the first lady:  Michelle s conclusion is, is that we can t have [Trump] in the Oval Office,  Obama said.Featured image via Olivier Douliery-Pool/Getty Images",News,"October 25, 2016"

4052, WATCH: Texas Judge Leaves Republican Party In EPIC Video Ripping Trump And GOP,"Donald Trump s vitriol and sexism just made a Texas judge leave the Republican Party, and she announced her departure on video.The exodus from the GOP continues as yet another Republican has decided to jump off the sinking ship that Republican leaders nominated Trump to helm.Judge Lauren Parish announced and explained her decision while seated in her seat at the 115th Judicial District Court, where she works. It is with a heavy heart that I have watched as the Republican nominee for president has made a mockery of our country and our citizenry,  she began. I have watched in horror as he has disavowed our military heroes, made fun of the disabled, divided our country along racial, religious and gender lines, mocked the judicial branch of government, expounded untruth after untruth, promoted violence and disrespect, boasted about sexual assault against women, and made vitriol the platform of his campaign.In short, my family values, my Christian value, my core beliefs have been disenfranchised by my party s nominee for president. Therefore, after much thought and deliberation I have decided that it would violate my conscience to continue to be a member of the Republican Party. Parish explained that she has seen Trump s hate and incivility trickle into local politics and she is sick of it. Quite frankly, I can no longer be affiliated with a party that could tolerate such antagonism and hatred,  Parish continued.  I can no longer sit idly by while this abhorrent disease continues to infect what was once a respectable and honorable political party of the past. The Grand Old Party of Lincoln no longer exists today. Parish explained that she was taught to love her neighbor and to build people up instead of tearing them down. And she refuses to sacrifice her values and beliefs just because the Republican Party is abandoning their own. I announce today that the current national Republican Party has abandoned all the principles instilled in me by my parents, my church and my community. As a result, I can no longer tolerate being affiliated with the current Republican Party. I see no way of reconciling my Christian beliefs with the manner in which the national Republican party is conducting itself. As of today, I am resigning my affiliation with the Republican Party. Here s the video via YouTube.[ad3media campaign= 1235 ]The reality that Republicans are leaving the party in Texas is huge because the state has slowly become a battleground state since Trump won the nomination. The race there is so tight, in fact, that Hillary Clinton is only down by three points. So Texas could very well be in play, and it s because moderate Republicans can no longer stomach Trump being the leader of their party.Featured image via screen capture from embedded video ",News,"October 25, 2016"
1874," Steve Bannon THREATENS Trump Over Removal From National Security Council, Administration In CHAOS","Yesterday, the Trump administration delivered a bombshell that no one saw coming   that former Breitbart News chief Steve Bannon, who is now serving as Trump s White House strategist, was being kicked off the National Security Council. While Bannon released a statement that seemed neutral enough, it turns out that s not how he really feels at all   and Trump is in trouble.According to a new report by the New York Times, Bannon aggressively disagreed with the decision to demote him. In fact, he was apparently so pissed off over being booted off the council that he even threatened to completely leave his position in the administration. The Times wrote: Mr. Bannon resisted the move, even threatening at one point to quit if it went forward, according to a White House official who, like others, insisted on anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. Mr. Bannon s camp denied that he had threatened to resign and spent the day spreading the word that the shift was a natural evolution, not a signal of any diminution of his outsize influence. Considering the fact that Bannon did not show up at Trump s press conference with Jordan s King Abdullah II, some bitterness on Bannon s part makes absolute sense.Bannon s position on the National Security Council has been controversial to begin with   it was a role he basically tricked Trump into giving him. Trump had signed off on an executive order without actually knowing what it said   and later got upset that he d accidentally and unknowingly given Bannon a position that he probably wasn t meant to have. Bannon had no relevant experience for a position on the National Security Council, but we all know that s hardly a prerequisite for a job in the Trump administration. Unfortunately for Trump, the White House is crumbling due to its own erratic, inexperienced staff.Featured image via Win McNamee / Getty Images",News,"April 6, 2017"
21211,NEW ACCUSATION AGAINST BERNIE SANDERS Exposes Him As “The Other” Criminal Democrat,"By now, it s pretty clear that Bernie doesn t respect other people s possessions. His whole campaign is built on the concept of stealing what belongs to other people. This story should really come as no surprise to anyone Officials with the Democratic National Committee have accused the presidential campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders of improperly accessing confidential voter information gathered by the rival campaign of Hillary Clinton, according to several party officials.Jeff Weaver, the Vermont senator s campaign manager, acknowledged that a staffer had viewed the information but blamed a software vendor hired by the DNC for a glitch that allowed access. Weaver said one Sanders staffer was fired over the incident.The discovery sparked alarm at the DNC, which promptly shut off the Sanders campaign s access to the strategically crucial list of likely Democratic voters.The DNC maintains the master list and rents it to national and state campaigns, which then add their own, proprietary information gathered by field workers and volunteers. Firewalls are supposed to prevent campaigns from viewing data gathered by their rivals.NGP VAN, the vendor that handles the master file, said the incident occurred Wednesday while a patch was being applied to the software. The process briefly opened a window into proprietary information from other campaigns, said the company s chief, Stu Trevelyan. He said a full audit will be conducted.The DNC has told the Sanders campaign that it will not be allowed access to the data again until it provides an explanation as well as assurances that all Clinton data has been destroyed.Having his campaign cut off from the national party s voter data is a strategic setback for Sanders   and could be a devastating blow if it lasts. The episode also raises questions about the DNC s ability to provide strategic resources to campaigns and state parties.Sanders spokesman Michael Briggs said four Sanders campaign staffers accessed Clinton data, and that three of them did so at the direction of their boss, Josh Uretsky, who was the operative fired.Uretsky told CNN Friday morning that he and others on the campaign discovered the software glitch Wednesday morning and probed the system to discover the extent of their own data s exposure. He said there was no attempt to take Clinton information but said he took responsibility for the situation. We investigated it for a short period of time to see the scope of the Sanders campaign s exposure and then the breach was shut down presumably by the vendor,  he told CNN.  We did not gain any material benefit. Weaver said the Sanders campaign never downloaded or printed any of the data, meaning it is no longer in possession of any proprietary information. He squarely blamed NGP VAN for the glitch   and blamed the DNC for hiring the company.He said the campaign has flagged similar problems with the software for the DNC in the past.For entire story: Washington Post",left-news,"Dec 18, 2015"

4723, These Two FANTASTIC Tweets Perfectly Show The Main Difference Between Hillary And Trump,"Last night, NBC hosted the Commander-in-Chief Forum in New York, where host Matt Lauer questioned Hillary and Trump for 30 minutes each (actually he put the screws to Hillary and lobbed puff balls at Trump, but that s beside the point). Hillary, as usual, was specific when answering questions, even those from veterans. Trump? Har de har har. His entire answer to every question boiled down to,  I have a plan, and it will work. Obama and Hillary have screwed this up for you, but my plan will fix it. In fact, the following tweets actually show the difference between Hillary and Trump when it comes to anything to do with policy:One striking contrast: How will you improve vets  mental health?Clinton: See my detailed plan, released last week Trump: The VA is corrupt  Dan Diamond (@ddiamond) September 8, 2016 Clinton: Points to specific allies and her 4,700-word mental health planTrump: Says he ll create something  great  to fix  corrupt  system  Dan Diamond (@ddiamond) September 8, 2016That s pretty much all Trump does. He makes grandiose but vague promises to take care of this, fix that, and more, and people believe him. He could say,  The VA is corrupt. Trust me. I know corrupt enterprises. I can spot them a mile away. The VA is definitely a corrupt enterprise, but I will fix it. We ll have the best veterans system in the world. The best. It ll be great,  and they ll just eat it up without question.That s why he s a demagogue.Meanwhile, we have Hillary Clinton in the other corner, who knows how to develop plans to handle things, and has actual, real ways to handle things, along with who will be enlisted to carry it out and/or help. She provides the specifics on her plans that Trump won t provide on his.That s the main difference between them now. Trump just says whatever he thinks people want to hear, and makes it vague enough that it ll be very easy for him to claim he never promised this, that or the other when, in fact, he did promise this, that or the other. Hillary actually tells people what they can expect.Photo of Hillary Clinton by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images. Photo of Donald Trump by Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"September 8, 2016"

Song s direct comments were: Medicare-for-all will never happen if we continue to elect corporate Democratic wh*res who are beholden to big pharma and the private insurance industry instead of us. Jane handled those comments with the same amount of class we ve seen from her husband during his entire campaign. Cuomo pressed Jane on Song s remarks, asking the Democratic candidate s wife: That was translated as being code for something about Hillary Clinton. Do you believe that, and what do you want to say about that choice of words? Basically, Jane didn t give Song s comments the time of day. She beautifully dismissed and condemned them at the same time, stating: I m sorry, I didn t hear it at all. Strange choice of words. And I can t imagine anybody was speaking about Secretary Clinton that way. I don t know who said that. She added,  All the campaigns really need to take some responsibility for what surrogates say. You can watch Jane masterfully shut down Song s comment below:Bernie also joined his wife in her criticism of Song s remarks on Thursday. Bernie, who has throughout the length of his campaign insisted on keeping to the issues and not engaging in the sort of childish in-party fighting that the GOP candidates have participated in, tweeted, Dr. Song s comment was inappropriate and insensitive. There s no room for language like that in our political discourse. After receiving backlash to his comments, Song apologized for his remarks, taking responsibility for their  insensitive  nature:Later, Song stated that his comments had not been in reference to Hillary Clinton, but to Democrats in Congress.

303, Trump Is So Bad Hillary Is Telling Him How To Be President And He’s Doing What She Says,"President Donald Trump has had some strong words for his fiercest political rival, Hilary Clinton, over the years, including having his supporters to chant  Lock her up!  at his political rallies, but now it seems that Trump has bitten off a little more than he can chew with this whole  President  thing and needs all the advice he can get   Even if it comes from Clinton. To make matters more amusing, he is actually acting on what she says!As the carnage from Hurricane Maria becomes more evident, President Trump has been a little too preoccupied with perpetually tweeting abound NFL players not standing for the National Anthem, while hardly acknowledging the fact that American lives are in danger after a enduring a week without electricity or clean water in Puerto Rico. On Sunday, Hillary Clinton had had enough of this madness and took to what she assumed was the only platform for getting Trump s attention directly, Twitter, to deliver a very direct message to the President of the United States:President Trump, Sec. Mattis, and DOD should send the Navy, including the USNS Comfort, to Puerto Rico now. These are American citizens. https://t.co/J2FVg4II0n  Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) September 24, 2017Clinton s call for action initially took place on change.org when she set up a petition that received 100,000 signatures in just three days, with critics showing their frustration with the hashtag #SendtheComfort. Both the hashtag and Clinton s tweet specifically mention the USNS Comfort, a hospital ship and, in what could be a simple twist of irony, although that is highly unlikely, Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Brock Long announced that that was exactly what the Navy was going to do just two days after Clinton s plea. We re dramatically increasing the federal footprint that s there,  Long said outside the White House, a motion later confirmed by the Navy.Trump himself commented on the difficulty of getting aide to Puerto Rico, but it really didn t sound as if he knew much about the place, let alone where it is, but still claimed that officials were  doing a really good job. It s very tough because it s an island,  Trump said.  In Texas, we can ship the trucks right out there. And you know, we ve gotten A-pluses on Texas and on Florida, and we will also on Puerto Rico. But the difference is, this is an island sitting in the middle of an ocean. And it s a big ocean; it s a very big ocean. The move to send the USNS Comfort came after days of criticism aimed at the US government for failing to truly offer any aide in Puerto Rico, a US territory of almost 3.5 million people, in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria. Large areas of Puerto Rico face months without power and as well as having an exceptionally long rebuilding process ahead of them.President Trump plans to visit the area next week.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"September 27, 2017"
7702, Twitter Goes Ballistic After Trump’s Penis Joke: ‘Some Things You Just Can’t Fact-Check’ (TWEETS),"Last night, the Republican primary went where no debate has ever gone before when it literally became a contest about penis size.This happened less than fifteen minutes into the eleventh GOP debate, when Trump addressed rival Marco Rubio s comments about his unnaturally small hands by assuring America that there was  no problem with the size of his junk. No one could believe that a presidential debate could devolve into such an immature, petty discussion   but you can always count on Trump to help the country sink to new lows.While many of us were probably stuck in a depressive state, wallowing over the fact that a nationally-televised event to vet the future president of the country has just been overtaken by a penis joke, Twitter swooped in to save the day. As soon as Trump made his ill-timed joke, Twitter was flooded with the most clever, hilarious reactions and gave everyone some much-needed perspective to keep us afloat as Trump continues to dominate the Republican polls.Here are some of the most amazing responses to Trump, to momentarily distract you from the fact that the guy who made a penis joke at the GOP debate might actually win the nomination:TwitterTwitterMany were anticipating what the media was going to do with this disastrous frat boy moment.TwitterThe New York Post and Huffington Post didn t disappoint:Twitter TwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterLast night s GOP debate was less about policy and the future of America than it was about Trump and his innate ability to made any serious political matter an absolute circus and spectacle. America cannot risk having someone like him fronting the GOP. Even though it would be an easy win for the Democrats, the fact that Trump has been able to gather the support of so many Americans is depressing.

23463,"Eyewitness Says Feds Ambushed Bundys, 100 Shots Fired at Passengers, Lavoy Finicum Killed With ‘Hands Up’","Patrick Henningsen 21st Century Wire UPDATE: 1-30-2016 Last night, the standoff at Malheur National Wildlife Refuge outside Burns, Oregon took a rather ugly turn which resulted in one man shot dead and another wounded by federal agents.The latest incident took place as two vehicles carrying protesters, led by Ammon Bundy, were en route to a community meeting in the nearby town of John Day in Oregon.According to numerous mainstream media reports and local media outlet Oregon Live,  federal sources  are telling the media that only  3 shots were fired , but a new eye witness testimony by one of the vehicle s passengers tells a very different story.While the mainstream media is still referring to the event as  a shoot-out , according to this latest eye witness account at the scene   no shots were fired by vehicle passengers.According to eyewitness Victoria Sharp, 18 yrs old, from Kansas, who was a passenger in the same truck driven by Arizona rancher Robert  Lavoy  Finicum, along with Ryan Bundy, Ryan Payne and Shawna Cox   dozens of federal vehicles and countless agents were waiting for the group, pre-positioned at a point along the isolated rural Highway 395, before intercepting the group and detaining 8 persons, including brothers Ammon and Ryan Bundy, who were booked into Multnomah County Jail early this morning.Sharp confirmed that the passengers never drew weapons and attempted to get out of their vehicles before federal agents fired  at least 120 shots altogether  at the vehicle carrying her party.RELATED:  Federal Government Escalated the Violence in Oregon Federal agents fired their first shots at passenger and militia leader, Ryan Payne, as he attempted to make contact with the agents by sticking his head and hands out of the window, at which point Payne got back inside the vehicle.Payne then exited the truck and was detained before driver Finicum advanced the vehicle further down the road before sliding into a snow bank on the side of the road.A second vehicle, a Jeep with passengers including Ammon Bundy, had already been stopped by authorities, with its all passengers taken into custody with no one harmed.A third vehicle driving approximately one mile ahead at the front of the convoy, carrying Sharp s mother and young siblings, was allowed to pass through the police roadblocks without incident. Finicum then attempted to drive around the next federal road block, but lost control of the vehicle before careening into snow piled on the road s hard shoulder.After crashing into the snow bank on the side of the highway, the driver, 54 yr old Arizona resident, Lavoy Finicum (photo, above), then exited the vehicle, visibly upset and with his hands in the air, before being gunned down by federal agents. Finicum was walking with his hands in the air, daring federal agents,  Just shoot me! Just shoot me    at which point the agents shot him dead. The witness testimony indicates that his hands were still in the air.Numerous  red dots  from lasers could be seen pointed on the passengers by federal marksmen, in what was described by this witness as an  ambush  by federal authorities. Sharps said,  I had 20 lasers on me when I got out of the car. She also confirmed that Ryan Bundy was shot and wounded in the arm by federal agents was shot while still inside the truck.Federal forces then followed-up by firing CS tear gas rounds around the vehicle, apparently in an attempt to further disable the remaining passengers.At least 40 federal vehicles, as well as many armed federal agents including some seen emerging from the surrounding forest along the highway, should leave little doubt as to the scale and nature of the operation.Listen to Ms. Sharp s harrowing testimony here: IMPORTANT NOTE (UPDATE 1-30-16): According to this recent report by Pedro Quintana from Central Oregon local affiliate News Channel 21, Sheriff Palmer was not at the federal roadblock and had no prior knowledge of the FBI ambush of the Bundy convoy. According to the chat session relayed in Pedro Quintana s report, Palmer was asked in an online chat,  Did you witness Lavoy shooting, or no? , to which Palmer replies,  NO  The shooting from what I hear was close to 4 and I heard of it at about 5:45pm.  News 21continued: Palmer responded he had no knowledge of anything about the plans or who was coming to the public meeting. He went on to say that the  FBI and Oregon State Police know me, they shared nothing with me and they know I wouldn t have allowed it. Earlier mainstream media reports that Palmer was present at the FBI roadblock would lead Bundy supporters to believe that Palmer had betrayed the Bundys and Lavoy Finicum. One the main sources, if not the main source of the original Sheriff Palmer controversy appears to be none other than Oregon Live staff writer Les Zaitz who has slipped-in this key piece of line into his report which which says: They said they didn t know how long the roadblock would be place. Grant County Sheriff Glenn Palmer was there.  Not surprisingly, this has set-off a virtual backlash online against the Grant County Sheriff, as evidenced by the following screen shot of Google search link found here:  Is this a case of media dirty tricks by Oregon Live? Certainly, Oregon Live s coverage of Burns events has been skewed from the beginning, and have been running character assassination pieces against Malheur occupiers in a effort to discredit the protest. Sheriff Palmer is clearly on record as being sympathetic to the Hammond Ranch protest and had recently opened up a constructive dialogue with the Bundys and occupiers from Malheur Wildlife Refuge. If Pedro Quintana s News 21 report is indeed accurate, then one might conclude that Oregon Live put out a piece of disinformation, likely designed to further divide the protest movement and create dissension in militia and activist ranks. However, until Sheriff Glenn Palmer comes out and issues clear statement declaring where he was   and where he wasn t, then people will continue to speculate what really happened. (END OF UPDATE)Conflicting AccountsReporter Les Zaitz from Oregon Live, a key source of mainstream media information from the Refuge protest, did not give prominence to Victoria Sharp s account in his article, but instead chose to lead with and highlight the secondhand account of the other vehicle s passenger Mark McConnell who claimed that unarmed victim Lavoy Finicum  charged at law enforcement  before being shot. Zaitz s article even admits that McConnell s vehicle was at least 200 yards behind the truck driven by Finicum.Incredibly, Oregonian Zaitz appears to favor McConnell s account on the basis that his account has  matched accounts from law enforcement sources.  McConnell issued his version of events after being released from law enforcement custody, where he spoke for 2 hours with federal agents.Tabloid news site Raw Story also ran with a similar narrative with a deceptive headline that read  Eyewitnesses knock down conspiracy theories about LaVoy Finicum , referring to secondhand accounts by McConnell and colleague, Melvin Lee.As it turns out, Mark McConnell did not actually see the shooting, and instead had  pieced together  his account, as evidenced by his own statement later posted online: going off of what Shawna Cox and Ryan Payne were saying, which were in the vehicle, um, Visually, I seen the truck take off, you know, now any time someone takes off in a vehicle away from law enforcement after they exercise a stop, it s typically considered an act of aggression and foolish. Payne said while they were sitting there and they were clearing my vehicle that him and LeVoy had a heated discussion but he took off they had to chase him, and from what Shawna Cox was saying  from inside of his truck that when he exited the vehicle  he charged after law enforcement . What I do know to be true, from what Payne said and what Shawna said taken pieces here and pieces there and from what I witnessed, um, I didn t see the shooting, um, he was not on his knees, he was not, none of that non sense, that was a miscommunication on somebody else s part but he went after em, he charged em. Here, McConnell is, in effect, issuing a proxy statement on behalf of Victoria Sharp s fellow passengers, Shawn Cox and Ryan Payne. This is hardly admissible, as both Cox and Payne are currently in federal custody and are not able to verify the accuracy of McConnell reiteration. And yet, mainstream media outlets are propping-up McConnell s account, while minimizing Sharp s.After speculating about the shooting, McConnell then says,   I didn t see it, and I m not going to speculate on it. McConnell is said to have been driving in the rear vehicle with Ammon Bundy and his private security, Brian Cavalier.SEE ALSO: Activists or Terrorist? The Truth About the Oregon StandoffUPDATE 1-28-2016: On Wednesday evening, CNN International released a report based on an  anonymous government source  claiming that Finicum was killed by federal agents because he was  reaching towards his waistband.  The Washington Post then re-spun the story, and rather incredibly   is relying on the very same secondhand story presented by Mark McConnell, in a desperate attempt to prop-up the government s version of events: In the moments before he was shot by authorities Tuesday afternoon, Finicum led a high-speed getaway attempt. He then reached for his waistband, prompting authorities to open fire, according to a CNN report.The report, which cites anonymous law enforcement officials but has not been confirmed by The Washington Post, is corroborated by a statement from an occupier who said he was traveling with Finicum at the time of the traffic stop. The fact the media have chosen to label this incident as a  traffic stop  indicates an obvious agenda designed to minimize the obvious   that this was a pre-planned, elaborate ambush by the FBI and Oregon State Police.This same unnamed  source  cited by CNN is also told the network that the incident was indeed captured on video by the FBI, but that authorities  have not decided whether or not the release the video.  (see more breaking updates on this development below)See a full breakdown CNN, Washington Post and the government narrative here.Federal EscalationThis shocking turn of events comes just days after Oregon governor Kate Brown issued what some might consider to be a veiled threat to the protesters and militia, saying that the federal government  must move quickly to end the occupation and hold all of the wrongdoers accountable. Reports last week indicated that the governor had personally written the White House and President Obama, which specifically addressed Attorney General Loretta Lynch and FBI director James Comey, in which Brown expressed her outrage that Harney County and the state of Oregon was not being recognized for its  collaborative achievements , but rather for  outsiders seeking to exploit and manipulate a local matter for their own agenda. According to the FBI s press release, arrested individuals include:Ammon Edward Bundy, 40, of Emmett, Idaho Ryan C. Bundy, 43, of Bunkerville, Nevada Brian Cavalier, 44, of Bunkerville, Nevada Shawna Cox, 59, of Kanab, Utah Ryan Waylen Payne, 32, of Anaconda, Montana Joseph Donald O Shaughnessy, 45, of Cottonwood, ArizonaAfter the federal operation on Highway 395, in a separate incident back at the Wildlife Refuge, YouTube and internet radio personality, Peter Santilli, 50, of Cincinnati, Ohio, approached the venue and walked towards federal agents before being taken into custody.BREAKING: Booking photos of Ammon Bundy, 7 others after arrest near Burns. https://t.co/AcqRyP4pd5 #KOIN6News pic.twitter.com/un82wepf95  Brent Weisberg (@BrentKOIN) January 27, 2016Those still in detention are scheduled to be arraigned at 1:30 p.m. Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Portland.According to reports, FBI agents in Phoenix also  made a probable cause arrest of Jon Eric Ritzheimer, age 32, on a federal charge related to the armed occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Harney County, Oregon. Jon Ritzheimer, another controversial YouTube personality and former US Marine, appears to have left the Malheur Refuge right before the federal operation to apprehend the protesters, when he returned to his home in Peoria, Arizona.Back at the Refuge protest site, the FBI are said to be negotiating with remaining 8 to 10 occupiers inside, with reports that most women and minors have already left the site.Three weeks ago, Finicum, who become the protest s media spokesperson, made a prophetic statement on camera saying that,  There are things more important than your life, and freedom is one of them.  Watch:UPDATE 1-28-2016: Any public distrust or skepticism of the federal authorities would immediately be dispelled by speed release of all video footage (with dozens of agents and surveillance, there should have been more than one video feed taken, including body and gun sight cameras) of the event. Whether or not, and how fast this will happen remains to be seen.UPDATE 1-29-2016 at 01:30PM ET: Due to public pressure and intense speculation about the events of Tuesday evening, and also because of the YouTube recording of eye witness 18 yr old Victoria Sharp, the FBI has released the unedited aerial video footage from Tuesday evening s incident which took place along Highway 395 here. According to the official FBI statement:  We feel that it is necessary to show the whole thing unedited in the interest of transparency.  The FBI video entitled,  Complete, Unedited Video of Joint FBI and OSP Operation 01/26/2016 , does show the victim Lavoy Finicum exiting the truck awkwardly in at least two feet of snow, and he clearly does not  charge towards  the SWAT team, and his hands are clearly held high above his head as he exits his truck when confronted by a SWAT team, before being shot multiple times by marksmen and falling in the snow. Also, the scale and size of this operation is very evident by the footage, and the apprehension of the protesters was not the result of a mere  traffic stop  as erroneously characterized in multiple mainstream media reports. On its own, this FBI drone footage would appear to support previous government and media claims by CNN, Washington Post and others that the victim was indeed  reaching towards his waistband  which gave federal and state police justification to unleash deadly force. However, it is still not completely clear from this aerial footage whether or not Finicum was holstered (he is said to normally carry a gun on the right hip, but FBI are claiming he had a 9mm gun in his inside left breast pocket), but also whether or not he lowered his arms before, or after he was shot multiple times. For example, if Finicum had his hands in the air and was then was shot in the abdomen first, then any man s natural reaction would be to then lower his hand(s) and clutch the wound. Additionally, if any shots were fired, even in the vicinity, then confusion could have ensued which might have prompted Finicum to reach for his weapon. Either way, it is impossible to make any such a forensic determination without a corresponding audio track  which would help to determine if any shots were fired before Finicum s hand(s) could be seen lowering.

23105,"CNN’s Hostile Treatment of Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard after revealing US are arming, funding Terrorists in Syria","21st Century Wire says Recently, Democrat Hawaii Congresswoman, Tulsi Gabbard, went on CNN s  The Lead  hosted by Jake Tapper, to talk about Donald Trump s foreign policy, and more importantly, to discuss the disturbing reality of US taxpayer support for armed militants and terrorists in places like Syria. Instead of adulation for doing the honorable thing, she received a hostile reaction from one of CNN s many highly paid onscreen propagandists. When asked by CNN s Jake Tapper (photo, right) about US Representative Tulsi Gabbard s recent visit to Trump Tower, she replied,  My goal in going there, in receiving the invitation to speak to President-elect Trump was to speak specifically about the situation in Syria, the dangerous consequences of escalating the regime change war that the United States is fuelling there along with countries like Saudi Arabia, and Qatar, and Turkey are escalating that through a so-called no-fly zone or safe zone. And urging him to end our regime change war there to stop funding both directly and indirectly groups that are working with Al Qaeda and ISIS. And to stop funneling those dollars and weapons and other assistance through these others countries like Saudi Arabia who are directly supporting these terrorist groups who are supposed to be our enemy, who we re supposed to be fighting to defeat. Visibly agitated by her answer, Tapper then asks Gabbard, herself an Iraq War veteran and a current member of the Hawaii National Guard, about her recent Bill introduced on the House floor last week entitled, the  Stop Arming Terrorists Act,  which proposes severe legal repercussions to any US officials or persons involved in the arming or funding, either directly or possibly indirectly, of terrorists overseas   including the US-backed  rebel  terrorists currently operating in Syria. What s key is that Gabbard points out that this activity is funded by the US taxpayer. Not surprisingly, CNN has never before reported this side of the clandestine issue before. Here s how their fascinating conversation transpired:TAPPER: And tell me about legislation. You have a bill that you introduced today that would address loopholes.GABBARD: Yes.TAPPER: You say have allowed American taxpayer dollars to fund terror groups such as Al Qaeda and ISIS in Syria. Are you   are you suggesting that the U.S. government is funding these terrorist groups?GABBARD: I m not only suggesting it. This is   this is the reality that we re living in.TAPPER: Not directly, though.GABBARD: Most Americans   you know, if you were   I were to go and provide money, weapons, or support or whatever to a group like Al Qaeda or ISIS, you would immediately be thrown in Jail. However, the U.S. government has been providing money, weapons, intel assistance and other types of support through the CIA, directly to these groups that are working with and are affiliated with Al Qaeda and ISIS.TAPPER: So, you re saying the CIA is giving money to groups in Syria, and those groups are working with Al-Nusra and ISIS.GABBARD: There are   there have been numerous reports from The New York Times to the Wall Street Journal and other news outlets who have declared that these rebel groups have formed these battlefield alliances with Al Qaeda, that essentially is Al Qaeda groups are in charge of every single rebel group on the ground fighting in Syria to overthrow the Syrian government.Tapper goes on to act stunned and befuddled, insinuating that Gabbard is  wrong    as if Gabbard were somehow making up her accusations, as he becomes somewhat confused trying to manage CNN s complicated contrived narrative. Tapper then insists that  Obviously, they (US-funded  rebel  terrorists) are all fighting Assad.  Gabbard quickly calls out Tapper s clear attempt at US State Dept propaganda talking points management Here s the latter exchange:TAPPER: And the U.S. government says they vet the groups that they give money to very, very closely. And that you re wrong, there are not alliances between groups at the American taxpayers fund and these other groups. Obviously, they all are fighting Assad.GABBARD: I beg to differ. Evidence has shown time and time again that that is not the case, that we are both directly and indirectly supporting these groups who are allied with or partnered with Al Qaeda and ISIS, in working to over throw the Syrian government of Assad. And we ve also been providing that support through countries like Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Qatar to do that. Gabbard s brave new legislation might be the most important and explosive development regarding Syrian Foreign Policy in Washington, but instead of pursuing this discussion, CNN s Tapper predictably tried to change the subject to Michael Flynn instead.Watch this incredible exchange here: 21WIRE has reported previously on the possibility that CNN is serving as a media adjunct to either the State Department, the Pentagon, NSA or the CIA (or a combination of the four). Judging by Jake Tapper s dismissive reaction to the facts on the ground, and his attempt to discredit Gabbard live on air, only strengthens the case that CNN is peddling an agenda for those US departments and agencies.21WIRE also reported previously how CNN has clearly chosen to only air coverage favorable to what the network has claimed to be  rebels  in Syria, when in reality   these were mostly terrorist fighting groups. CNN s star reporter  Clarissa Ward even went so far as to characterize terrorist suicide bombers in a sympathetic manner in her reports   clearly designed to give positive PR to terrorists groups like Al Nusra Front who have been occupying East Aleppo since 2012. Other actors in the field seemingly employed by CNN who are operating in clear support of terrorists in East Aleppo include one Bilal Abdul Karim an apparent US asset promoting jihadist extremism, together with Ward, producing what are clearly staged reports, alongside CNN s endless airing of unvetted, staged White Helmets imagery, passing it off to the viewing public as authentic video and photos supplied by nameless  Syria activists .  21WIRE has recently revealed additional terrorist-links with the White Helmets, who are a US State Dept, British Foreign Office and EU-funded pseudo NGO.Throughout the west s proxy war against Syria, CNN has only reported the rebel/terrorist perspective, shamelessly portraying militant terrorists as  moderate rebels  and freedom fighters, while systematically demonizing any Syrian or Russian who is defending the nation-state of Syria. This might explain Tapper s near contempt for Gabbard s accurate statements regarding US arming and funding of known terrorist groups in Syria.2016 was the year that CNN was exposed as perhaps the most corrupt mainstream media outlet in the United States. A number of other leaked emails revealed an unprecedented level of media corruption and systematic partisan collusion between operatives at CNN and the Hillary Clinton Campaign   a naked violation of every fundamental principle of nonobjective press practices. In the leaked email exchanges, one could see gleeful Clinton campaign officials boasting about getting favorable news coverage from compliant mainstream media  journalists    with CNN being perhaps the worst offender. Clinton staffers even went so far as to circulate names of journalists who were deemed  friendly  to their candidate.Among the notorious Wikileaks email dump was a CNN request to DNC staffers asking for questions to ask during a Wolf Blitzer interview with then GOP candidate Donald Trump.In another email on April 28, CNN operative Jason Seher, a writer for Jake Tapper s show  The Lead  on CNN, emailed DNC media coordinator Pablo Manriquez thanking him for working behind the scenes with CNN.In a separate conversation CNN s Seher, then thanked DNC insider Martinez for  facilitating Luis coming on today, and bearing with us through a meelee of GOP nonsense and cancellations and all that. Any particular points he ll want to make? We re gonna stay Dem focused Perhaps the worst CNN violation of press independence was when the network s supposed  chief political analyst , Gloria Borger, tried to get an interview with Clinton chief of staff John Podesta by assuring him of essentially softball questions. I know John will have an exalted place in the campaign, and would love to chat with him about HRC, in a general way, not in a gotcha way re HRC,  said Borger.  It would be about 10 mins, very general, about her as a person and a candidate. What is most amazing about all of this, is that CNN executives refused to consider firing any of their personalities who have been implicated in open collusion with the Democratic party during one of the most crucial political contests in US history.In another leak provided to The Intercept by the source known as Gucifer 2.0, other CNN reporters discovered on the DNC s  VIP List  of media operatives counted on by the Clinton campaign included Kate Bouldan, Brianna Kielar, Jeff Zeleny, Sam Feist, David Chalian, John Berman, and Mark Preston.The only person who lost their paid position with CNN was the now disgraced political operative, Donna Brazile, currently still holding onto her gifted position as interim Chairwoman of the DNC   who was also moonlighting for extra cash as  contributor  for CNN. Brazile was also a Super Delegate for Hillary Clinton. Podesta Email dumps exposed the fact that Brazile, a CNN contributor was caught giving Hillary s campaign debate questions in advance of CNN s Town Hall debate event.As a result, CNN s reputation as a trustworthy media outlets has been held in question by most of the public.When it comes to coverage of both the 2016 Election and the Syrian War, CNN has been on the wrong side of history   and should not be trusted to give accurate and fair reporting regarding serious and important issues.

15817,23 YR OLD SOMALI REFUGEE TURNED NATURALIZED CITIZEN ARRESTED FOR TERROR PLOT AGAINST US,"From the amazing Ann Corcoran s Refugee Resettlement blog: Ho hum! Another of those Somalis we are still bringing into America as refugees at the rate of 800-900 a month has been indicted in Columbus, the city second only to Minneapolis as a city being colonized by a large population of Somali Muslim refugees (thanks to those  religious  non-profits hired by the federal government to place them!).This latest jihadist came here as a child and your tax dollars helped raise him! (I ll have more tomorrow, just wanted to get the news out while it s hot!) Stay tuned A 23-year-old resident of Columbus, Ohio, who trained with a group affiliated with al Qaeda has been arrested and charged with plotting an attack on American soil, the Justice Department revealed today.Abdirahman Sheik Mohamud, a naturalized American citizen of Somali descent, had been instructed by a cleric to return to the United States and carry out an act of terrorism, the indictment said.The Justice Department stated that Mohamud was also an Islamic State sympathizer, and that his brother, Abdifatah Aden, was killed fighting with the group in Syria in 2013.According to court documents, Mohamud left the US a year ago with the intent to go to Syria and train with a terrorist group linked to al Qaeda in Iraq.In April 2014, he purchased a one-way ticket to Greece, but during a layover in Istanbul he failed to board a connecting flight to Athens and instead made his way to Syria.Once he reached his destination, Mohamud stated that he received training in shooting weapons, breaking into houses, explosives and hand-to-hand combat.The 23-year-old Columbus man aloes said that after completing his training, a cleric with the group Jabhat al-Nusrah instructed him to return to the US and commit an act of terror.The 23-year-old returned to the US in June 2014 with a plot to attack a military base or a correctional facility, targeting people in uniform, according to court documents. Mohamud talked about doing something big in the United States,  the papers cited by ABC News indicate.  He wanted to go to a military base in Texas and kill three or four American soldiers execution style. On Thursday, Mohamud was indicted on one count of attempting to provide and providing material support to terrorists, one count of attempting to provide and providing material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization, and one count of making false statements to the FBI.The first two counts, providing material support to terrorists and providing material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization are each crimes punishable by up to 15 years in prison.Making false statements involving international terrorism carries a maximum sentence of eight years in prison.Mohamud was arrested on state charges February 21, 2015, and is expected to be transferred into federal custody based on today s indictment.Before Mohamud s brother was killed in battle on or around June 3, 2014, the two had exchanged emails discussing the 23-year-old s plans to travel to Syria and fight with Islamic State. In February, Mohamud asked Abdifatah Aden how he could send him money.Later that month, Mohamud was arrested at his Columbus home for allegedly providing a computer tablet an other material support to terrorist organizations abroad.Prosecutor Ron O Brien at the time asked a judge to set Mohamud s bond at $1million saying he was a flight risk and posed a threat to public safety.Mohamud s attorney, Sam Shamansky, insisted that his client was not a terrorist and would not flee because he was taking care of his ailing mother in Ohio.Via: UK Daily Mail ",politics,"Apr 16, 2015"
8842," Bernie Sanders Blocked From Speaking At Iowa High School, Guess Who They Let Speak Instead","Urbandale High School students worked hard to get a presidential candidate come to speak at their school in Urbandale, Iowa. Both Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump said that they would come speak to at the high school. Trump ended up speaking during the school s homecoming. Sanders was blocked by the administration.The Des Moines Register reports on the story, saying: The billionaire Republican visited the high school s homecoming in September after students launched a month-long campaign to recruit a presidential candidate to campus. Students had also reached out to the campaign of Bernie Sanders, who couldn t make the fall homecoming dance, but expressed interest in a later visit. Campaign officials recently tried to firm up Sanders  visit, but were turned down by school administrators. Students say they were told that another candidate visit would be too much of an administrative hassle. There were allegations of the school playing favoritism by only letting a Republican candidate speak to the school. The move prompted a backlash from some of the students. We let Donald Trump come as a presidential candidate, but in reality the main focus of his appearance at our school was that he was a high-profile celebrity,  said Josh Ingham, a senior at the school.  So we wanted a politician that is only involved in politics. So when the administration turned down this opportunity, we were kind of surprised and outraged since the campaign directly contacted our school. We had the opportunity. Ultimately, the matter was resolved with a somewhat weak compromise. Sanders wasn t allowed to speak at the school but some Urbandale students were given reserved seats at a Sanders  event. They were able to meet Sanders back stage at the event.The Des Moines Register reports that Ingham who, along with other students, was about to launch a petition to get the school s administration to reverse their decision, got a very special shout out from Sanders at the event: Sanders  Iowa staffers reserved prime seats at his Saturday evening appearance at the Iowa State Fairgrounds and set up a quick meet-and-greet with the candidate. About 25 Urbandale students gathered backstage behind a black curtain that separated them from the crowd of more than 1,500 waiting for the Vermont senator s arrival.When Sanders reached the venue, he handed a microphone over to Ingham and asked him to tell the group what had happened at the school. He told them standing up to their school was  a very brave thing to do. It s great that those students who attended the event got to have that experience. However, it is antithetical to the idea of civics education to have only one candidate, from one party speak. Representative democracy is about having candidates present their ideas, and then letting people decide who they agree with. When an institution only lets one side of the aisle speak, all they are doing is providing another bully pulpit for that party or candidate. Which is totally not cool.At least some of those students learned a valuable lesson.

201, WATCH: Reporters DRAG Sarah Huckabee Sanders In Brilliant Fact-Check (VIDEO),"Donald Trump is having a hard time recovering from his fallen soldier debacle, not only because he continues to make it worse, but because America is tired of his nonsense and demands the truth.It was only yesterday that White House Chief of Staff John Kelly infuriated everyone by criticizing Rep. Frederica Wilson for calling Trump out for disrespecting a Gold Star widow. Kelly also went after Wilson for an old speech in 2015, stating that she d bragged about how she had gotten money for the FBI acknowledging two deceased agents. Little did Kelly know, this lie would ignite a sh*tstorm for the Trump administration.Earlier today, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was the unfortunate recipient of the media s frustration with the dishonest Trump administration. Reporters blasted Sanders with questions in the press briefing, directly pointing out that Wilson s FBI speech completely contradicted Kelly s claims. When a reporter boldly pointed out that Wilson had never boasted about funding in her speech, Sanders stumbled through her response: Absolutely, General Kelly was stunned that Representative Wilson made comments at a building dedication honoring slain FBI agents about her own actions in Congress, including lobbying former President Obama on legislation. As he pointed out, if you re able to make a sacred act like honoring American heroes all about yourself, you re an empty barrel. Or as we say in the South, all hat, no cattle. This was hardly the end for Sanders. Because she d defended Kelly despite being faced with facts that challenged his claims, reporters attacked her and asked if she d even seen the speech. Sanders claimed she had, and a reporter pointed out that she should know that Wilson actually praised the FBI agents and didn t talk about funding. Even as her spot was completely blown up, Sanders pathetically defended Kelly.The icing on the cake was when a reporter asked if Kelly would respond to more questions over the matter. When Sanders said he already had yesterday, the reporter pointed out: He was wrong yesterday! As usual, the Trump administration responded with intimidation and bullying. Sanders fired back: If you want to go after General Kelly, that s up to you. If you want to get into a debate with the four-star Marine general, I think that s something highly inappropriate. Go ahead. You can watch Sanders get grilled by reporters below:Featured image via Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images",News,"October 20, 2017"
16880,EPA Jails 185 Americans For ‘Environmental Crimes’ But No One For Massive EPA Toxic Spill,"Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) enforcers helped convict 185 Americans of environmental crimes this year, with each of these eco-convicts getting sentenced to eight months in prison on average for crimes ranging from biofuel fraud to illegally removing asbestos. Every year, EPA agents help put dozens of Americans in prison for breaking U.S. environmental laws. Environmental crimes range from spilling coal ash into public waterways, to pretending to produce biofuels, to illegally cleaning up asbestos in buildings.Interestingly enough, EPA has not fined or jailed anyone for the spilling of three million gallons of mine wastewater in August. That month, EPA workers opened up the Gold King Mine and sent a toxic plume of mine waste though rivers in Colorado, New Mexico and Utah. Toxic mine waste even went through Navajo Nation territory and resulted in farms having their water supplies shut off.Republican lawmakers were quick to criticize EPA for not taking any disciplinary action against contractors or employees involved in the Colorado mine spill. Lawmakers noted that while EPA drags its feet, a private company, like Duke, would have been fined quickly if it had spilled mine waste.The Department of the Interior s outside review of the spill incident found EPA could have avoided a blowout if it had taken precautions agency workers had used while opening other sealed Colorado mines.Interior found that had the agency used  a drill rig to bore into the mine from above  to open Gold King  the mine would have been revised, and the blowout would not have occurred. The EPA has taken responsibility for the spill, but still hasn t taken actions against agency workers who opened up the mine mouth. In fact, lawmakers are worried the agency is trying to taint a federal investigation into the spill.Read more: Daily Caller",Government News,"Dec 31, 2015"
7969, Yelp Fires Employee After Her Brutal Complaint About Low Wages Goes Viral (TWEETS/IMAGES),"A Yelp customer service employee was fired just two hours after her open letter to Yelp CEO Jeremy Stoppelman went viral.Talia Jane, a 25-year-old living in the San Francisco Bay area in California, worked as a customer service rep for Yelp s Eat24 food-ordering app. But after the company caught wind of a blog post she d written about how she and many other employees of Yelp struggled to make ends meet, she was fired. In her open letter entitled  An Open Letter To My CEO , she wrote: Every single one of my coworkers is struggling. They re taking side jobs, they re living at home. One of them started a GoFundMe because she couldn t pay her rent. Another guy who got hired, and ultimately let go, was undoubtedly homeless. Jane also spoke of how difficult it was to pay her rent when the company would only pay her $12.25 an hour, which translated to $8.15 after tax. Of her monthly expenses, Jane also had to spend over $200 to take public transportation to work, as her apartment was 30 miles away.Jane had tried to find ways to make it work. She explored living together with a co-worker, but soon found out that most of them lived with their parents or also could not afford the rent on their wages. Jane said, I thought to myself,  Oh, I m tremendously f*cked,  so I m just going to try really hard on improving at this job so I can transfer and get a pay increase, but then I was told that wouldn t happen for at least a year. To pay her rent and bills, Jane cut back on groceries and did 40 hours of overnight shifts every week   but she eventually reached her breaking point. She told Business Insider: I brought up the wages in every quarterly meeting I had with my managers. They were well aware that I was struggling despite doing what I could with what I had. The last straw was when I woke up yesterday two hours after going to sleep because my stomach hurt from hunger. And it s something I m used to, but this time it was really driving me to put something in my stomach immediately   I couldn t wait 15 minutes for my rice to cook and it all became very clear that this shouldn t be an issue I was dealing with to the point where I forgot it wasn t normal. It was then that Jane realized she couldn t continue on like this. She decided to start tweeting Yelp s CEO.TwitterTwitterTwitterJane followed those tweets with a blog post on Medium, where she spoke of  balancing all sorts of debt and trying to pave a life for myself that doesn t involve crying in the bathtub every week.  She wrote: I haven t bought groceries since I started this job. Not because I m lazy, but because I got this ten pound bag of rice before I moved here and my meals at home (including the one I m having as I write this) consist, by and large, of that. Because I can t afford to buy groceries. Bread is a luxury to me, even though you ve got a whole fridge full of it on the 8th floor. But we re not allowed to take any of that home because it s for at-work eating. Of which I do a lot. Because 80 percent of my income goes to paying my rent. Isn t that ironic? Your employee for your food delivery app that you spent $300 million to buy can t afford to buy food. That s gotta be a little ironic, right? MediumDriving her point home that her payment at Yelp was NOT a living wage, Jane went on to explain:I got paid yesterday ($733.24, bi-weekly) but I have to save as much of that as possible to pay my rent ($1,245) for my apartment that s 40 miles away from work because it was the cheapest place I could find that had access to the train, which costs me $5.65 one way to get to work. That s $11.30 a day, by the way. I make $8.15 an hour after taxes. I also have to pay my gas and electric bill. Last month it was $120. According to the infograph on PG&E s website, that cost was because I used my heater. I ve since stopped using my heater. Have you ever slept fully clothed under several blankets just so you don t get a cold and have to miss work? Have you ever drank a liter of water before going to bed so you could fall asleep without waking up a few hours later with stomach pains because the last time you ate was at work? That post went viral, viewed by over 85,000 people. In an interview with BuzzFeed, Jane said: I wanted [Stoppelman] to understand that I wasn t some little, annoying fly buzzing around his head. I wanted him to understand that I m not some obnoxious idiot who thinks it s funny to harass the CEO on Twitter. I m someone who has concerns and is reaching out, hoping that he can do something. I was sitting there and thinking,  I hope he sees this and I hope my CEO listens and hears me,  and then it started to dawn on me: I wonder if I ll get fired for saying this out loud? It only took two hours for her to find out. Soon, her company email account stopped working, and Jane was fired. She said, My manager and HR told me the letter and what I wrote violated Yelp s terms of conduct. A spokesperson for the company released the insensitive statement: We do not comment on personnel issues. However, we did agree with many of the points in Ms. Jane s post and we viewed it as her real, personal narrative about what it s like to live in the Bay Area. Most importantly, it s an important example of freedom of speech. We agree with her comments about the high costs of living in San Francisco, which is why we announced in December that we are expanding our Eat24 customer support team into our Phoenix office where will pay the same wage. However, Jane insists that Yelp isn t being honest about why she was fired. She said, Yelp is trying to make this die down by lying about it. Firing someone while their post about pay issues is on the cusp of going viral, that s like a lightning strike in the middle of a super dry forest. Things have just exploded. Jane is currently trying to find a new job, and will likely struggle financially until she can (hopefully) find something more promising than her former position at Yelp. If you are interested in helping Jane, she has left these details on another blog post detailing her termination from the company:Featured image via Talia Jane",News,"February 20, 2016"
22547,"Who’s The Fascist? Barack Obama, Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton?","Margaret Kimberly Global ResearchThe U.S. public loves fascists; they elect them, constantly. Donald Trump, who  says he would raise the minimum wage and stop the endless efforts at regime change,  is called a fascist by some.  But Hillary Clinton  is happy to bomb Libya or Syria or any other country,  and played a major role in mass Black incarceration. Barack Obama is the war-maker and deporter-in-chief.  All of the major party candidates fit the F word description in some way. Donald Trump is the ill spoken, boorish, graceless version of every American president in modern history. He differs from them only in his unconcealed appeals to white nationalism. But Democrats aren t much better. They pretend to work on behalf of human, civil and economic rights but those claims are lies. They are meant to hide their partnerships with corporate America, very wealthy individuals and the worldwide imperialist project.If Trump is a fascist then he will fit in nicely with the pantheon of horrific men we are told to respect and venerate. Barack Obama charges and convicts whistle blowers with the little used espionage act from the era of Woodrow Wilson. He claims and has exercised an invented right to kill Americans. His predecessor invaded and occupied Iraq but he continues the dirty deed there and in Afghanistan. He tries to fool the public by assassinating  al Qaeda number two,  over and over again. Al Qaeda certainly doesn t lack for plan B staffers.Bush the younger cut tax rates for rich people but Obama didn t change that. Under the guise of compromising with intransigent Republicans he did the same thing. When he and the Democrats controlled Congress in 2009 and 2010 they raised the minimum wage a paltry 70 cents.Conversely, Donald Trump says he would raise the minimum wage and says he would stop the endless efforts at regime change. Neither Hillary Clinton nor Bernie Sanders have questioned that fundamental premise of American foreign policy. Hillary Clinton has already proven herself to be particularly blood thirsty. She is happy to bomb Libya or Syria or any other country. Her so-called expertise amounts to nothing more than an expansion of state sponsored terror committed by the United States.Trump says he wouldn t cut Social Security while Barack Obama famously declared that he and his 2012 Republican opponent, Mitt Romney, agreed on the need to cut this program that was once called the  third rail  of politics.Every president since the 1980s has grown the horrific mass incarceration industry. Using wars on drugs as a pretext they have locked up 2 million people, half of whom are black. No one comes into office with any intention of undoing America s leadership as the world s worst jailer.American history teaches black people to be, at the very least, wary of public officials who are beloved by red necks as much as Trump is. When Trump speaks of preventing Muslim immigration or deporting all of the estimated 11 million undocumented people in this country he is making inherently racist appeals.That is why he is protested and rightly so. But the protesters have already missed the mark by giving a pass to equally questionable policy actions and statements coming from Democrats.It is a Democratic president who brought back a cold war against Russia and recklessly brought troops to the edge of that country s borders.This scenario was unheard of during the worst days of the cold war and now risks nuclear confrontation. That is because George W. Bush unilaterally abrogated the missile defense treaty with Russia. Perhaps he can be called a fascist also.The trade deals passed by American presidents with congressional connivance grow worse. There is no longer any pretense that their goal is to help corporations maximize profits and minimize everyone else s rights. Not even members of Congress were allowed access to the text of the Trans Pacific Partnership legislation.If Trump is protested, Obama ought to be as well. He is spending his last year in office on an imperialism tour. He goes to Hiroshima for photo opportunities with atomic bomb survivors while building more nuclear warheads than any other president. He tells endless lies about Russian  aggression  but he is the provocative head of state.Trump should be disliked by Latinos and everyone else when he says that Mexican immigrants are rapists and murderers. But Obama is the deporter in chief, sending a record number of Latino immigrants out of the country with dubious rationales, devastating them and their families.Apparently all of the major party candidates fit the F word description in some way. Trump s bombast and ignorance make him the easiest to pick out of the crowd but appearances are deceiving. It seems that if a politician has the right establishment credentials and knows how to give prepared speeches he or she can get away with committing any outrage.In just the last 40 years American presidents or their allied partners in crime have killed people in Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Congo, Somalia, Haiti, Grenada, Gaza, Kosovo, Serbia, Sudan, Syria, Libya and Yemen. What do they have to do to be called fascists? Showing bad manners seems to be the only thing that sets off expressions of outrage among Americans.There is already fascism in the White House, the Justice Department, the State Department and Congress. The only question is who will be the next person to keep that sick machinery running.This article originally appeared on Global ResearchGet 10% off a 21WIRE TV membership package today using promo code: STU21WIRETVEVERYTHING ON ELECTION 2016: 21st Century Wire Election Files",US_News,"June 9, 2016"
4195, SICK: Trump Told 14-Year-Old Girls He Would Be Dating Them In A Couple Years,"Another bit of news from the past has come back to haunt Donald Trump s already imploding campaign.Only days after an Entertainment Tonight clip went viral showing Donald Trump talking about how he will be dating the 10-year-old girl he just met in ten years, the Chicago Tribune dug into their own archives to find another disturbing news blurb quoting Trump speaking to a pair of 14-year-old girls in 1992. In a December 1992 wire brief in the Chicago Tribune, Trump is described as having spotted a youth choir singing Christmas carols at the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan,  the Tribune reported.  He asked two girls how old they were. When they said they were 14, Trump, then 46, replied,  Wow! Just think   in a couple of years, I ll be dating you. Here s the news clipping via the Chicago Tribune. The bit about Trump is at the lower right hand corner under the yellow highlight.There you have it. Donald Trump jumped from disgustingly talking about him dating a 10-year-old girl in ten years to directly telling two 14-year-old girls that he will be dating them in two years. For the record, both girls would still be considered minors under the law. Furthermore, Trump s own daughter Ivanka was 11-years-old at the time, which makes these revelations even creepier.Trump has been under fire for over a week now since his remarks about groping women came to light. Accusations of sexual assault from multiple women, including Miss Teen USA contestants who have revealed that Trump walked in on them in their dressing room to see them naked, have flooded the media ever since and the Republican nominee is struggling to explain himself and his predatory behavior.These revelations also give more credibility to a child rape case that Trump is currently embroiled in, which goes to a status conference in December that Trump must attend. The lawsuit was filed by a woman only known as Jane Doe, who says Trump raped her in 1994 when she was 13 years old.And given the fact that Trump apparently likes openly hitting on underage girls, it sounds like Jane Doe has a case.Donald Trump is a sick man and a pervert who should not be anywhere close to being President of the United States. But Republicans chose him to be their leader and now America is living a nightmare that can only end if Trump and the GOP loses by a total landslide on November 8th.Featured Image: Spencer Platt/Getty Images",News,"October 14, 2016"
16854,“HILLARY WILL BE INDICTED”,"The question is who Obama will protect? Will he stand by his  Yes woman,  Attorney General Loretta Lynch, or will he provide cover for Hillary, allowing her to emerge as the successor to his corrupt two terms in office? Our money is on Obama protecting Attorney General Loretta Lynch if Valerie Jarrett has anything to do with it A former U.S. Attorney predicts a Watergate-style showdown in the Department of Justice if Attorney General Loretta Lynch overrules a potential FBI recommendation to indict Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.

They are going to make a recommendation that people be charged and then Loretta Lynch is going to have the decision of a lifetime. I believe that the evidence that the FBI is compiling will be so compelling that, unless [Lynch] agrees to the charges, there will be a massive revolt inside the FBI, which she will not be able to survive as an attorney general. It will be like Watergate. It will be unbelievable.

8326, What Trump Just Said About The LGBT Community Will Make Conservatives Go Crazy (VIDEO),"In a stunning reversal, Donald Trump said that he will strengthen the rights of the LGBT community and bring people together. His new stance comes just days after he said that as president, he would   strongly consider  overturning Obergefell vs Hodges, the Supreme Court decision that found that same-sex couples have a legal and constitutional right to marry. I m a lesbian, we ve had some great progress for the gay and lesbian community,  NECN reporter  Sue O Connell told Trump. When President Trump is in office, can we look for more forward motion on equality for gays and lesbians?  Here is Trump s response: Well, you can. We re going to bring people together, and that s your thing, and other people have their thing. We have to bring all people together and if we don t we re not going to have a country anymore. Now that s one big flip-flop because in addition to Trump saying he would appoint judges to overturn Obergefell vs Hodges, he has stated in the past  time and time again that he only supports marriage between a man and a woman. He has said: I m not in favor of gay marriage. I don t feel right about marriage equality. Trump has even gone as far as to compare same-sex relationships to choosing the wrong kind of golf putter! He said:  It s like in golf. A lot of people   I don t want this to sound trivial   but a lot of people are switching to these really long putters, very unattractive. It s weird. You see these great players with these really long putters, because they can t sink three-footers anymore. And, I hate it. I am a traditionalist. I have so many fabulous friends who happen to be gay, but I am a traditionalist. In trying to rationalize the irrational, it s most likely that Trump is pandering to New Hampshire voters for the primary, 67% of whom support gay marriage. Whatever his reasoning, his  new position is going to upset his bigoted right-wing conservative following.Featured image via video screen capture ",News,"February 5, 2016"

7331, Marvel Vows To Boycott Georgia If Discriminatory Religious Liberty Bill Becomes Law,"The studio of superheroes will leave Georgia rather than make movies in a state that bullies gay people.The First Amendment Defense Act passed the Republican-dominated Georgia legislature earlier this month, but has yet to be signed by Governor Nathan Deal.Should the bill become law, it will allow conservative  Christians  to use their religion as a shield to justify bigotry and discrimination toward same-sex couples and give religious organizations the ability to fire gay employees at will.The bill has caused an uproar and many companies have stopped or are threatening to stop doing business with the state if it becomes law.That includes the NFL, which promptly told Georgia officials that such a blatantly discriminatory law would cost Atlanta the Superbowl bid they have been desperately seeking.And now Marvel and Disney have made an even bigger threat.As most of us know, many of Disney s Marvel films are shot in Georgia because of the state s advantageous tax incentives. Captain America: Civil War was just recently filmed at Pine Wood studios in Atlanta and such a massive production means jobs for people in Georgia and a boost in the economy.But if Georgia chooses to enshrine bigotry into law, Marvel will take their heroes elsewhere. Disney and Marvel are inclusive companies, and although we have had great experiences filming in Georgia, we will plan to take our business elsewhere should any legislation allowing discriminatory practices be signed into state law,  Disney said in a statement that should worry Georgia officials to the core.It makes sense that Disney would pull the Marvel Cinematic Universe away from Georgia if this bill passes. After all, it s hard to imagine trying to film characters who believe in equality, fairness, and inclusiveness in an environment that promotes the exact opposite.Georgia would be well-advised to scuttle this bill before it costs them dearly. Because pissing off Captain America is not a good idea.Featured Image: Marvel s The Avengers",News,"March 23, 2016"
7740, GOP Poll Workers Accused Of Cheating Dem Voters On Super Tuesday (AUDIO),"Independent voter Chris Sullivan went to the polls in Princeton, Texas on Super Tuesday, intending to cast a ballot in the Democratic primary.Sullivan says that a poll worker at Princeton High School, located in Collin County, Texas, instructed him to select any voting machine, saying that it didn t matter if he was voting for a Republican or a Democrat.Once Sullivan had selected a machine, however, he says it locked his vote in for a Republican candidate.As a result of being locked into a republican ballot, Sullivan says he was unable to cast his vote in the primary election.Following the debacle, he took to voice his outrage at having his vote stolen by GOP cheats.Image credit: screen capture, Chris Sullivan on FacebookAddicting Info spoke to Sullivan on March 2.He clarified what happened further, saying, It wasn t that I was directed to the wrong line  I was specifically told by one of the people at the desk that it didn t matter what party I chose, I could vote for anyone. Sullivan also told us that the poll worker he spoke to was clearly not neutral. I was standing behind a couple and the woman (poll worker) asked if they were voting republican. When they said yes, she replied  good cause I already locked you in. It might be easier to dismiss what happened to Sullivan as an error, as opposed to deliberate cheating, had he not overheard the same worker giving very different instructions to the Republican couple.Sullivan also told us that he felt like  there was a strong push to vote Republican,  from the poll workers.While he s not sure if any other Collin County voters had a similar experience, Sullivan says that he has already contacted attorneys for the Bernie Sanders campaign to report what happened. He also plans to report his experience to the Texas Attorney General s office today.As reported here, Democratic voters in Georgia also may have had their votes stolen, thanks to Republican dirty tricks.Brianna Fleener was one of many Democratic voters who were issued Republican ballots in Lowndes County, GA. I show up, I fill out the paper and I give it to the man at the counter,  Fleener told ValdostaToday.  Next, I was given a card to insert into the machine, and when I pulled up the screen I realized I was given the wrong ballot. Fleener says that several other Democratic voters were also given Republican ballots. As I look around, I notice I m not the only one. Turns out that anyone voting Democrat received a Republican ballot. After making some phone calls, we were told we could fix it, but we were showing up in the system as voted when none of us had casted our ballots. Democrats may not have been the only ones cheated out of their votes by the GOP on Super Tuesday.Austin s KLBJ radio station was flooded with calls claiming that voting machines were flipping votes from Donald Trump to other GOP candidates.Listen to the vote flipping accusations, reported to KLBJ, via Raw Story on YouTube: Image credit: imagebuddy.com, photoshop",News,"March 2, 2016"
1916, Here’s The Third Turncoat Democrat Who Needs To Be Primaried Over SCOTUS In 2018 (DETAILS),"Another day, another  Democrat  who is backing the nominee for the Supreme Court seat that the Senate Republicans stole from President Obama. We have previously reported on how traitorous  Democrats  like Joe Manchin (DINO-WV) and Heidi Heitcamp (DINO-ND) have turned tail and voted with Republicans on many issues   most notably falling in line with Republicans in order to confirm right-wing potential Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch. Now, we have a third to add to that list: Joe Donnelly of Indiana. Donnelly said of his decision to be a traitor to his party on this issue: After meeting with Judge Gorsuch, conducting a thorough review of his record, and closely following his hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, I believe that he is a qualified jurist who will base his decisions on his understanding of the law and is well-respected among his peers. The only redeeming statement Donnelly has made is his expressing his opinion that the Senate should still have a 60-vote threshold when it comes to confirming Gorsuch or any other nominee for the Supreme Court. That is paramount, because it means that there is a true bipartisan Senate consensus for the Court s nominations and confirmations, which is a rule set by the founders to make sure that one party and its views do not dominate the judiciary.Of course, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell cares not one whit about that; he and his fellow GOP cronies have insisted that Gorsuch will be on the Court  one way or another.  This means he is willing to breach the 60-vote rule to make sure Gorsuch makes it to the Supreme Court. What the Republicans did to President Obama s nominee Merrick Garland is a travesty and a disgrace, and the Democrats should do the same for Gorsuch. For those who won t   PRIMARY THEM. We have no time for DINOS in these troubled times.

9475,MICHIGAN Senate Approves Bill To Allow Concealed Carry In “Gun Free Zones” Or “Mass Murderer Empowerment Zones”,"Should legal gun owners be allowed to freely carry anywhere in their state, including dorm rooms and school campuses?In the wake of mass shootings in Las Vegas and Texas that left dozens of people dead or injured, a Michigan Senate committee approved bills Tuesday that will allow gun owners to carry concealed weapons in gun-free zones such as schools, churches, day care centers, bars, dorms, and stadiums.The shooting at a Baptist church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, on Sunday, which left 26 people dead and 20 more injured, makes state Senate Majority Leader Arlan Meekhof, a Republican from West Olive, Mich., more certain that now is the time to take up the gun legislation. Some have said it s insensitive to bring up these issues now, but I feel quite the opposite,  he told a standing-room-only crowd in the Senate Government Operations Committee.  The recent events will allow us to look at how we can deter those who want to do harm. And responsible, well-trained, licensed concealed-pistol holders can be one of those deterrents. The bills taken up in the Senate Government Operations Committee passed on a party-line vote with Republicans supporting the three-bill package and Democrats opposing it. The bills also would close the open-carry loophole, effectively barring gun owners from openly carrying their weapons in gun-free zones.He gained support from gun rights groups, including the National Rifle Association and the Michigan Coalition for Responsible Gun Owners. The idea of having the ability to arm a well-qualified, well-trained individual is tantamount to setting out a scenario where we no longer set up a sheep for the wolf,  said Robert Rudowski of the gun owners group.Gun-free zones should be called  mass murderer empowerment zones,  said Steve Dulan, spokesman for the gun owners group.Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder, a Republican, vetoed similar legislation in 2012, just four days after a horrific shooting in Newtown, Conn., when a heavily armed man muscled his way into Sandy Hook Elementary School and killed 20 first-graders and six adults.Snyder said that bill had a fatal loophole that didn t allow for those institutions to opt out of the new legislation and prohibit weapons from their buildings. His spokeswoman, Anna Heaton, said Tuesday that Snyder hasn t seen the latest version of the concealed- carry bills and hadn t taken a position on them.Meekhof said he has talked with Snyder about the new legislation and that he s  not necessarily  on board with it.  USA Today Never-Trumper  Governor Rick Snyder (R), who some Republicans believe leans to the left on more than one important issue, like vetoing legislation that would require MI voters to have a valid ID in order to vote, is currently facing some serious allegations related to the Flint water crisis.WXYZ   Harvey Hollins, the man Gov. Snyder appointed to handle the Flint Water Crisis, recently testified that he told the governor about increasing lead in Flint water months before Snyder told Congress he learned about it.The testimony came during the preliminary hearing for Michigan Health and Human Services Director Nick Lyons, who is facing involuntary manslaughter and misconduct in office charges for his alleged role in the water crisis.Hollins testified that he told Snyder in July 2015 and August 2015 that there were concerns about increased lead levels in Flint s water.During congressional testimony in March 2016, Snyder testified that he didn t even learn about the dangerous levels of lead in Flint s water system until October 2015. I told the governor that we re hearing a lot more folks complaining about lead, copper, and TTHM (total trihalomethanes),  Hollins testified.We d love to hear what you think about legal gun owners being able to carry anywhere in their state?

7233, REPORT: Here’s Why Donald Trump Has No Friends And Has To Ask Co-Workers To Hang After Work,"When Donald Trump stood at his podium at a rally and declared,  I have no friends You re my friends,  he apparently wasn t kidding. A scathing new report from The New York Times tells the sad story of a Donald Trump who at nearly 70-years-old has no real friends.One of Trump s favorite things to talk about are his celebrity friends. In the past he s been chummy with the likes of Oprah Winfrey, Regis Philbin, Howard Stern and he loves playing golf with athletes like Tom Brady, but the reality is, none of those people are what you and I would classify as friends. Richard LeFlak, a real estate tycoon who has known The Donald for four decades, told the Times that Trump is  very gregarious and has lots of acquaintances, but people he s close to? Not so many. LeFlak isn t alone in his analysis of Trump s personal life:  He doesn t really have a lot of friends,  said Billy Procida, a financier and business confidant of Trump s,  Pretty much all he does is work and play golf.  Reverend Al Sharpton, who knew Trump before he decided to become a Republican all of a sudden, said: Out of all the political and business and entertainment circles that we ve moved in together over the years, I never really met anyone who was Trump s good friend. In fact, I ve never even met anyone who claimed to be his good friend. It may seem harsh, but that s just how Trump operates. He s an introverted narcissist who spends his time with family, presumably because he doesn t have anything to prove. That analysis fits with a statement from Trump s longtime coworker and head of acquisitions, Abe Wallach, who told the Times that Trump would practically beg coworkers to hang out with him after work: Donald would call and say,  Abe, what are you doing? Marla and I are flying down to Atlantic City. You and David want to come?  Wallach said.  I always thought:  Why me? I work with him all week. Isn t there someone else? Apparently not. There is very little that suggests that Trump is capable of forming and maintaining personal relationships with people who aren t related to him. Wallach gave the Times the reason why: Deep down, he s a very nice guy,  Wallach said,  but he can t let go and just be nice because he fears that people will take advantage of him. Donald is actually the most insecure man I ve ever met. He has this constant need to fill a void inside. He used to do it with deals and sex. Now he does it with publicity. Ouch. Obviously, if a man who has known Trump most of his professional career and spent time with him and his family can spout off like that and trash The Donald s social skills so easily, there must be something to it. It could be that Wallach is right; that Trump lacks the confidence and self-respect to trust that not everyone is out to screw him, or it could be far simpler. He might just be an insufferable douchebag.Whatever the issue, what we have here is just another reason Donald Trump is unfit to hold the highest office in the land. Personal relationships are certainly important in trade, foreign policy and relations across the aisle. Trump s failures as a human being will easily translate to failures as a diplomat and commander-in-chief.Featured image by Jeff Mitchell, Getty Images",News,"March 28, 2016"
5271," Two Days Ago, Trump Asked Russia To Hack Clinton And Today They Did Just That","It s time the American people wake up to the dangers and the treasonous nature that is Donald J. Trump. Two days ago, at a press conference that made national news for being absolutely ridiculous, Trump had asked the Russians (either government or non government) to hack into the United States cyberspace to gather Clinton emails. The reason? He wants WikiLeaks, at the behest of Russia, to undermine Clinton and help him get elected.Well today, it s been confirmed that the Clinton campaign s computer system have been hacked   and the Russians were probably the ones who did it.U.S. intelligence officials have found evidence clearly linking state-sponsored Russian hackers to breaches in multiple Democratic affiliated organizations, including the fundraising Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and the Democratic National Committee. The Clinton campaign has now been added to the triangle of breaches.Reuters broke the story Friday afternoon, receiving no comment from the Department of Justice nor any Russian officials. When reaching out for comment, Reuters wrote:The Clinton campaign, based in Brooklyn, had no immediate comment and referred Reuters to a comment from earlier this week by campaign senior policy adviser Jake Sullivan criticizing Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and calling the hacking  a national security issue. Reuters has also no knowledge of what specifically had been breached in the Clinton computer system.Maybe it s the emails Trump and his buddies at the Kremlin have been hoping for. Given Trump s public ignorance of knowing Putin   even though he has acknowledged in the past he does in fact know him very well   it seems the timing of this new hack against Clinton is very coincidental.Also given Trump s strange admiration for Putin and apparently for individuals that hack, a lopsided influence in the United States Presidential election in favor of him also seems very coincidental given the circumstances just now coming to light.By saying he hoped Russians hacked Hillary Clinton   which he tweeted and said on camera so it really isn t a  joke  to him   Trump has made clear that he is perfectly A-OK with victory based on cheating an treasonous associations.It s one thing to joke   it s another to have your Motherland thugs (who clearly support you) spring into action on your behalf.Whether or not Trump and his campaign clowns are involved (directly) in this remains to be seen. Whether or not Trump and his campaign clowns are involved indirectly remains to be seen. But thing is for certain: state sponsored Russian hackers are unfairly influencing this election, and like the KKK and David Duke, Trump and his campaign (save Mike Pence) have disavowed.That should scare everybody.Featured image via Joshua Lott/Getty Images",News,"July 29, 2016"
4515, Hillary Literally Laughs In The Face Of Reporter Who Pushes Insane Health Conspiracies (VIDEO),"In case you have been living under a rock, we recently learned that Hillary Clinton is human through a series of reports about That One Time She Coughed and The Time She Got Pneumonia. Yes, somehow anytime Clinton gets the sniffles, the Right pounces on it, using anything and everything they can to push absolutely bonkers conspiracy theories about the former Secretary of State s health (she s on her deathbed, don tchaknow).During an interview with ACB s Sarina Fazan Wednesday, the reporter asked Clinton perhaps one of the dumbest f*cking questions she has been asked regarding her health: if she would undergo  neurocognitive tests  to appease inflated, only-existing-on-Trump s-side-of-the-aisle concerns about whether or not her presidency will be like a four-year-long edition of Weekend at Bernie s.Hillary just laughed in her face.  I m very sorry I got pneumonia, I m glad antibiotics took care of it, and that s behind us now,  the former Secretary of State said, somehow managing to avoid knocking the reporter for starting off by claiming 9/11 was  last week.  Clinton explained that her health meets and exceeds the standards anyone else running for office has met, but Fazan was all  so, ummmm, you gonna take those tests? There s no need for that,  Clinton said firmly, surely wondering how the f*ck this woman got hired in the first place.  The information is very clear. Hillary wasn t the only person laughing at Fazan, who also beat the dead horse that is the email  scandal.

23011,FAKE NEWS WEEK: Exposing The Mainstream Consensus Reality Complex," In response to the establishment media s contrived  fake news  crisis designed to marginalise independent and alternative media sources of news and analysis, 21WIRE is running its own #FakeNewsWeek awareness campaign, where each day our editorial team at 21st Century Wire will feature media critiques and analysis of mainstream corporate media coverage of current events   exposing the government and the mainstream media as the real purveyors of  fake news  throughout modern history Patrick Henningsen 21st Century WireSome things never change. In the 21st century, people in power are still attacking independent voices for speaking up for what they believe, and for sharing their opinions.The first time I heard the term  fake news  uttered in unison from the mouths of mainstream media pundits, the irony was overtaken by the absurdity of it. It was beyond outrageous, and hearing it coming from the mainstream media was bordering on vaudeville. After watching and analyzing decades of media deception and government-issued press releases masquerading as hard news, and then to see the establishment attempting to force-feed this meme down our collective mainstream feeding tube, I suppose that would make the old editorial board at Soviet Izvestia wince (not that they were any worse than CNN is today).Sure it s laughable, but it s also incredibly sad to watch otherwise well-educated, smart and intelligent media professionals get so caught up in the political comedy-tragedy that was the 2016 Election   they volunteered en mass to abandon their senses and any semblance of journalistic objectivity, in order to join in a virtual witch-hunt. This was a new low-point for mainstream media, and for America.This topic is vast and growing more controversial by the day. There s a lot to unpack and we know, based on past performance, the mainstream media can t be trusted to do an objective job, much less critique itself. Their conversation is completely out of order. To help right this process, 21WIRE has launched Fake News Week to help educate the public on aspects of this important issue which will most certainly be ignored by the establishment media. Throughout this week, we will present a number well-researched articles cataloguing actual fake news and demonstrating this is a mainstream problem, and one as old as the media itself.The Story of Fake NewsSince the dawn of mass media in the 20th century, media propaganda has been steadily advancing in western societies. This process is being accelerated through technology. If you are waiting for the mainstream media to finally get together for some mass-mea culpa or have one giant come to Jesus moment, then you ll just be waiting for Godot. No, instead of reigning itself in, they have constructed an elaborate straw man instead, which they are calling  fake news. With the passage of the US presidential election, many thought that the  fake news  meme would die off. Instead, the Establishment is doubling down on it, in hysterical fashion.We re told that the real problem started because of an unlikely  fake news  cottage industry, supposedly run out of the Balkans, in a little Macedonian village called Velles (if we are to take The Guardian and BuzzFeed s word for it, anyway), where enterprising eastern European teens started pumping out countless fake news articles, making use major social media platforms to propel their articles. That s right, there was actual fake news circulating on Facebook, but calling it news is a bit of an overstatement. If one were to accurately label it, it would just be called junk.It was in late September that I first noticed all of these fake news posts pouring into nearly every Facebook news groups I subscribed to. I began collecting links from about 50 URLs in a vain attempt construct a database in order to work out where it was coming from, who was behind it, and what was the object of the exercise. At first thing I thought,  how could anyone take any of these seriously? Everyone is used to junk on Facebook, but these were ridiculous. One of the silliest stories was this one: Hillary Clinton Buying Illegal Weapons  Kremlin Reports.  Granted, you d have to be a real fool to take articles like that seriously, and yet, this is what mainstream media and academia are doing. They have made these obviously bogus internet posts into the pretext for a centralized system of control, arbitrated by Facebook and others, with the remit of deciding a  baseline  for what is true and what is deemed as fake news.As it turns out, during the election cycle and every day since, the only people who took these stories seriously were the mainstream media and still disgruntled Clinton supporters   both of whom are insisting, baselessly, that these spoof stories somehow swung the US election. Sure, there is a radical minority of short attention span web surfers and 3am Reddit junkies who would grab and run with these type of stories, but I would think that most normal people would have thought,  What idiot would believe any of these.  By November, my database of fake news and  election news  websites was approach 300. It became clear that new websites were being launched almost daily. These sites had a few things in common; all were over-loaded with Click Bait pop-up ads, and many of them carried malicious malware. Undoubtedly, the owners of these faux news sites had been raking-in a fortune in CMP ad revenues based on traffic that was not so much driven by genuine interest, but rather out of entertainment-based curiosity, and possibly a depraved desire to shock friends and loved ones with crazy online stories. The real damage was subtle  by flooding social media with junk, they would rapidly push real independent news and alternative media articles down the page s timeline, and into cyber limbo.Qui bono? Certainly, the establishment media, watching their main competition   real independent media outlets, drowning in a cesspool of internet flotsam and jetsam of fake Trump and Hillary  articles.  Just like those cheap Chinese knock-offs at your local flea market, someone aped the alternative media, devaluing and damaging it in the process. If only it had ended there On Nov 18, 2016, I woke up to an inbox full of friends and colleagues informing me that this website, 21stCenturyWire.com, had been featured in the L.A. Times expos  on  fake news   the first major blacklist of  fake news  websites featured in the mainstream media entitled,  Want to keep fake news out of your newsfeed? College professor creates list of sites to avoid.  A number of these blacklists have appeared online for a number of years, but this was the first time such a list was given credence by a mainstream publication.The list was created by one Melissa Zimdars, an academic and radical progressive-liberal activist, who teaches  media studies  from Merrimack College in Massachusetts. The story was quickly syndicated all over the globe, including spinoff reports by CNN and The Guardian. Not surprisingly, the author of the article was another liberal activist, a journalist named Jessica Roy. Like Zimdars, Jessica Roy is a feminist activist, and had previously used her position as a mainstream journalist to produce hit pieces promoting a radical liberal social agenda. Both Roy and Zimdars appear to support many of the same causes and are pushing similar political campaigns on social media, and were likely committed Hillary Clinton supporters too. With that in mind, both Roy and Zimdars were probably very unhappy about 21WIRE s harsh criticism of Secretary Clinton s tenure as head of the US State Department under Obama from 2009-2013, and probably were not chuffed either that we called the establishment s official  Russian Hack  conspiracy theory a hoax during the presidential campaign. Both of those articles went viral in the week before the election.Many other excellent and reputable independent news sites were also on the list, but were intentionally placed alongside well-known satire websites, as well as with obvious poorly crafted  fake news  sites. I seriously wondered if Dr Zimdars, a professor in media studies, thought so little of her own students that they should require her professional guidance to tell them that the The Onion is not a real news site. She also lists other satirical websites like Britain s Private Eye on her list. Less than two days after the article appeared, Zimdars removed Private Eye from the list (probably after getting an email from their legal department). Here we can see she has thrown a variety of people into one giant basket (of deplorables), thus branding everyone with the same derogatory label of  fake news  or its progenitor,  conspiracy theory. What s worse however, is that Merrimack College s Melissa Zimdars appears to have lifted her celebrated list from a wacky left-wing blog site who had haphazardly cobbled the original list together (no visible methodology as to the selection process) and which had been fermenting up online for quite some time, long before Dr Zimdars was elevated by the LA Times and CNN. Not exactly academic, but the culture cops don t seem to care.Regardless, one would hope that any conscientious professional would agree that Zimdars  effort, or lack thereof, was a foolhardy attempt at passing off a politically-motivated virtual book burning list as a study.  It would be unacceptable for any undergraduate, or graduate student, much less something submitted as course material by a professor. And, to think that her students would pay thousands of dollars in course fees for Dr. Zimdars to teach them how to surf the internet. Is the bar really that low? I can t help but wonder how many of those students also signed-up for Critical Thinking 101.Judging by the amount of right-wing websites on her list, it s clear this was a political hit piece. That was the intention of article author Jessica Roy, evidenced by the fact that she offered no specifics of why any of these sites were on the list, nor did she challenge Dr Zimdars. Whatever it was, it was not journalism.A few days later, after the article in question was published in the LA Times, the paper removed the PDF image of the list, stating  fears and threats  as the reason for its disappearance. Their editor issued this statement: The professor who created the list has taken down the Google doc. She said it was a safety measure in response to threats and harassment she and her students and colleagues had received. She is continuing to work on it and plans to release it in the future in a format other than a Google doc. It s hard to keep up with Dr Zimdars  definitive guide to the internet because she has revised and changed so many times. Here is a version from January 2017:2017-DR ZIMDARS   False, Misleading, Clickbait-y, and Satirical  News  Sources   Google DocsSoon after, I contacted the LA Times, asking their editorial board for the right to reply in my own defense in their opinion section, citing my belief that Roy and Zimdars had created a politicized piece which was hardly fair and balanced, and was designed to slander and discredit all of the websites on their list. I finally received a reply from Larry Ingrassia at the LA Times. The paper s excuse for denying me a right of reply was weak and evasive. Ingrassia stated to me that:Ingrassia s claim that my website is not mentioned in the article was not true.  In fact, 21stCenturyWire.com appeared at the very top of the list in the database table image of Zimdars  list in the article. Just because it wasn t in the text of the article doesn t mean it wasn t still visible to millions of readers. Likewise, just because the LA Times had later removed the database table image from the article, and replaced it with a hyperlink to Zimdars  Google Doc, is no excuse either   because the list was up on the LA Times website, and was widely syndicated during that time.As it happened, I did email Dr Zimdars immediately after seeing Jessica Roy s LA Times article asking her why she had included my website on her list, and to cite any specific news articles which she thought were  fake  or  conspiracy  and asked her to please remove 21stCenturyWire.com from her list. Not surprisingly, she did not reply to my request. Perhaps she realized that every one of the thousands of articles on our website contain either secondary, or primary source, and include more reference links than you will find on most mainstream media reports. For an academic who purports to hold so many persons and their websites accountable for being  fake news    when confronted about her work, she acts aloof and completely unaccountable. This further proves the point that this was not a study, but rather an activist campaign, done on the Merrimack College s dime.My experience with the LA Times was a disappointing one   seeing a paper running with a cheap politicized hit piece, and then being dismissive when asked for equal time on the issue. Such is the state of many leading American media institutions. If this is what passes for the Fourth Estate in today s America, then the country is in deep trouble.Mainstream TrollingA few days later, I was then contacted by one of the US mainstream media most established investigative news programs, NBC Dateline. It was clear from their correspondence that they wanted to draw me into another fake news hit piece. This is one of NBC Dateline s email to me:If was bad enough to be slandered by a major national news outlet, now I was being trolled by the country s largest broadcast TV network?My reply to NBC s Calabrese was long but polite, and at the end I simply asked her for specifics   in other words, what exactly were these  unconfirmed reports  she was accusing 21st Century Wire of publishing? As a reporter for a major outlet like NBC, I should rightly assume that she might be able to provide me with some substance, and not just an ad hominem accusation. Here is part of my reply: Our content is not  fake  and anyone with a basic understanding of geopolitics and media should be able to tell that. Many people like our work, and many I am sure do not like it. But the content should speak for itself. If you find some articles on our site that you feel are  Click Bait-y  or  fake news    then let me know and I would be more than happy to help and discuss your findings. Just like with Dr. Zimdars, I received no reply from NBC. This led me to conclude that they were not at all interested in having a candid discussion about the state of the media today, a discussion I offered to have. But NBC wasn t looking for a real conversation on media. Maybe they were just looking for an easy mark, someone to set-up and frame in a expos  on the scourge of  fake news.  Another drive-by, hit-and-run piece.This wasn t the first time. We ve had similar approaches before by the BBC and others, sometimes through a third party, and always looking to draw us into one of their discomfiting  conspiracy  features on their network.Whatever it is that NBC thought we did that warranted an NBC Dateline hit piece, surely it can t be any worse than NBC s disgraced anchorman Brian Williams, now widely regarded as a serial liar. If you expected the company would want to preserve some integrity by letting him go after that embarrassment, you d be wrong. The same with CNN, after it was revealed how many of their staff were colluding with the Clinton campaign. Was anyone fired? The only person they let go was Donna Brazile, who was only a contributor and not a real member of staff.This begs the question: are big mainstream media outlets really capable of policing themselves? The answer to that question might tell us why the mainstream media have a 14% approval rating according to a recent Gallop poll.Take the big network s Syria coverage for instance. What about its ridiculous coverage of the 7 year old human agit-prop Twitter sensation, Bana of Aleppo? What about NBC getting its reports exclusively from Nusra Front (al Qaeda in Syria) occupied East Aleppo, and then spreading exaggerated false claims of  a complete meltdown of humanity  when in reality the terrorist-held part of the city was being liberated by the Syrian government? Unlike NBC, a billion dollar media operation, little 21WIRE actually had journalists like Vanessa Beeley reporting from on the ground in Aleppo during this period. Unlike NBC, we were able to give our readers and listeners an accurate depiction of events   although maybe not the pro-terrorist, or  activist  version of events which the western mainstream media have relied on through six years of war in Syria, consistently and conveniently feeding the mainstream media what it wanted   a regime change  narrative which was streamlined with US State Department, CIA and British Foreign Office policy. Did it ever occur to them that someone should go and talk to Aleppo s residents? It did to us. We figured the terrorists already had plenty of media coverage, what with NBC, MSNBC, CNN, ABC, CBS, BBC, Channel 4, the New York Times, The Guardian and others all in tow.These mainstream outlets would never give any any credit to 21WIRE and Vanessa Beeley for its coverage in Syria, no matter good the reporting is   because we re not conveying the right  narrative, which is the Establishment s narrative. In that sense, we out-performed the entire mainstream media on one of the biggest stories of the last five years   the Liberation of Aleppo. Maybe that s why they are coming after us.Channelling McCarthy Clearly, the corporate mainstream media in America has attempted to blame Hillary Clinton s loss on  fake news.  Clinton herself called it  an epidemic.  Indeed, it is an epidemic, however the unwashed masses on the internet are not the source of that pandemic. They should be looking in the mirror   for colluding behind the scenes with the Clinton campaign, first to kill-off the Bernie Sanders nomination, before colluding in the general election, too, thus betraying the fundamental principles of a Fourth Estate. As bad as those outlets appear to be, they almost pale in comparison to this next incident On November 24, 2016, The Washington Post descended deep into the lower detritus of the DC swamp. This piece of propaganda was simply breathtaking. The journalist who drew the short straw for this job was none other than Craig Timberg, who is also a John S. Knight Journalism Fellow at Stanford University. It sounds impressive, until you see his work.In his feature entitled,  Russian propaganda effort helped spread  fake news  during election, Experts say,  Timberg placed The Post into a leading role in waging a new McCarthy-style witch hunt, targeting hundreds of independent websites and blogs, most of them American, accusing them of being part of a giant Russian conspiracy to undermine American democracy on behalf of the Kremlin. Experts say ? Did they really? Only, in this case, Timberg would name his  experts    a cadre of secret sources operating under the anonymous collective brand of PropOrNot. We re told that these patriots had to protect their identity for fear of retribution from Putin s equally secret army of hackers. What was this, other than a propaganda piece run by The Post, one which could just as easily be classed as actual  fake news. The flood of  fake news  this election season got support from a sophisticated Russian propaganda campaign that created and spread misleading articles online with the goal of punishing Democrat Hillary Clinton, helping Republican Donald Trump and undermining faith in American democracy, say independent researchers who tracked the operation,  wrote Timberg. Way back when, if a piece this bad managed to escape out into the public sphere, either the editor or the reporter would get the sack. No such luck here.Timberg s cloak and dagger source managed to slandered some 200 websites, including many well-established, popular  alternative news outlets like AntiWar.com, Counterpunch, Information Clearing House, OpEd News, Activist Post, Global Research.ca, Oriental Review, Truth-Out, Truth Dig, Zero Hedge, Consortium News (run by award-winning investigative journalist Robert Parry), Ron Paul Institute (headed by former US Congressman and Presidential candidate, Dr Ron Paul)) and Paul Craig Roberts (former Cabinet member under President Reagan), to name only a few from PropOrNot s list of alleged  Russian propaganda  collaborators, in an attempt to reverse engineer a virtual conspiracy   trying to link 200 popular alternative websites with a theoretical Russian plot. When you read the content on most of these websites, you can see a few common themes   nearly all of them were highly critical of U.S. foreign policy under the last three US Administrations of Clinton, Bush and Obama. Most were also critical of Hillary Clinton s chequered record as Obama s Secretary of State. They also challenged the prevailing anti-Russian party line in Washington. Here, The Washington Post is channelling the spirit of Joe McCarthy by promoting a  Blacklist of independent journalists and commentators. A political hit piece by The Post, that s all.Soon after the publication of Timberg s fictional feature, The Washington Post caved-in to pressure by critics, printing this retraction soon afterwards:Editor s Note: The Washington Post on Nov. 24 published a story on the work of four sets of researchers who have examined what they say are Russian propaganda efforts to undermine American democracy and interests. One of them was PropOrNot, a group that insists on public anonymity, which issued a report identifying more than 200 websites that, in its view, wittingly or unwittingly published or echoed Russian propaganda. A number of those sites have objected to being included on PropOrNot s list, and some of the sites, as well as others not on the list, have publicly challenged the group s methodology and conclusions. The Post, which did not name any of the sites, does not itself vouch for the validity of PropOrNot s findings regarding any individual media outlet, nor did the article purport to do so. Since publication of The Post s story, PropOrNot has removed some sites from its list.They must hold their readership in such utter contempt as to not care what people think about the paper. How sad. What kind of paper would run a gargantuan fake news story like that? Are they still a paper of record ?Here at 21WIRE, and unlike the Washington Post, we recognize that our readership is intelligent enough to spot what the LA Times and the Washington Post are serving up and calling news. Unlike the Washington Post, we are not trying to bury under endless column inches government-issued propaganda.

20515,WOW! TEXAS IMAM Agrees With Trump About Shutting Down Muslim Immigration: “Peace comes before religion”,"A Texas Imam agrees with Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump s controversial suggestion that America set-up a  total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States  until further investigation can be done. The Imam also said there should be a ban of Syrian refugees of any religion.The Imam, Nidal Alsayyed, who leads a Beaumont, Texas, mosque agrees with both Donald Trump and Texas Governor Greg Abbott.Governor Abbott called for a halt to relocation of Syrian refugees into Texas after the Paris terrorist attacks. He also called upon President Obama to stop the importation of these refugees into the U.S., as reported by Breitbart Texas  Bob Price.12 News On Monday Trump called for  a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country s representatives can figure out what is going on,  as reported by Breitbart News.Trump said,  our country cannot be the victims of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in Jihad, and have no sense of reason or respect for human life. Trump issued a statement saying that Americans need to understand radicals within Islam before the government authorizes them to come into the country, as reported by Breitbart News.Alsayyed, the Imam from east Texas told his local television station,  I certainly see it to be wise [to] stop temporarily accepting any new Muslim immigrants [refugees and non-refugees] into the United States. Alsayyed leads the Islamic Center of Triplex. He said the halt applies to new refugees of any religion and he does not believe that taking this action is unconstitutional. The Muslim religious leader said these actions are acceptable  when it comes to peace and safety.  He also added,  This should not prevent the United States to fulfill its duties towards international partners. The Texas Imam said,  It does not matter whether Trump said it or anyone else   American Muslims need to say we are with this country.  He also said they should raise the American flag in support of the nation. He continued,  We American Muslims need to be sincere in our religion and to the country we are living in. Peace comes before religion. We need to be truthful and transparent when we express a viewpoint or feedback. It does not matter whether Trump said it or anyone else,  he said.When challenged on his comments the Imam responded in a comment via Facebook saying:I only said what I believe is right. Trump is not against American Muslims; He is against any new Muslim immigrants (refugees and non-refugees)! There is a big difference here! We cannot be emotional.I believe there is a great confusion and lack of understating nationally and among Muslim themselves for what Mr. Trump is calling for. Refugees in general have no clear identity or belief. They are seeking shelter and opportunity; but America cannot take this risk NOW!My advice to trump to stop differentiating among Christian vs. Muslim refugees; only because he may get surprised to see all refugees claiming to be Christians!The east Texas imam made local headlines last December when he denounces ISIS and their ruthless conduct. 12NewsNow anchor Kevin Steele asked Alsayyed if he would denounce ISIS. He strongly replied, Come on, no human being would accept this type of animal behavior. This is like, this is completely, it doesn t belong to any religion this ISIS. In Trump s statement on Monday, he noted a Center for Security Policy poll showing there are segments of the Muslim population that hate U.S. citizens. The poll showed that 25 percent of the Muslims polled  agreed that violence against Americans here in the United States is justified as part of the global jihad.  Fifty-one percent of those polled  agreed that Muslims in America should have the choice of being governed by Shariah. Breitbart News has also reported that The Economist/You Gov poll published in late November shows that Americans strongly oppose Muslim immigration into America. The poll showed that of those likely to vote in a primary election, approximately 30 percent believe that all, most, or more than half of Muslims worldwide support the Islamic State (ISIS).An Ipsos poll in mid-September revealed that even before the Paris terrorist attacks, public support for allowing more Middle East refugees into the country crashed once Americans understood the enormous numbers of refugees, as reported by Breitbart News.Before the San Bernardino, California, attacks, a full 61 percent opposed Obama s refugee program, as reported by Breitbart News  John Nolte.

8154, Conservative Megachurch Pastor Forced To Resign After Being Busted For Extramarital Affair (VIDEO),"Another conservative  Christian  hypocrite gets exposed and you ll enjoy the hilarious twist at the end.A female parishioner at the Orlando Baptist Church in Florida forced Pastor David Janney to step down in disgrace after she revealed through a lawsuit that he had an affair with her and promised her hush money to stay quiet about it.In 2015, Janney made sexual advances toward Arlene Miranda, a church member since 2008, and sent her text messages professing his fantasies about her. In September of that year, Janney and Miranda had sex at the offices of his charity World Hope, Inc.Afterward, he sent this text regretting that there wasn t a better time or place for their affair and told her that he needed to talk with God and work things out. You re beautiful, you re very sexy, your body is amazing and you re very passionate,  the married 61-year-old pastor wrote.  I wish we had a better place and a better time for today. You re more than I fantasized. Be proud of yourself. [A]md now please give me a few days to work through my mind my heart and talk to my Lord. More than anything I want to be the man of God and your pastor. Janney later told Miranda to stop texting him out of fear that his wife might catch him, to which Miranda asked if she was just a one-night stand. I have tried to help you with your feelings,  he replied as if she s to blame for the situation.  I do not have the ability to deal with your feelings all the time. You have to get a handle on this. According to the lawsuit, Miranda sought council from another pastor at the church, who also seemed to fault her for the affair. Miranda was told she has a  religious duty  to the church and should remain silent to protect Janney.Once he learned that the person in this affair was David Janney, Pastor Don told Plaintiff that she had a religious duty to protect Defendant, the church, and the Orlando Baptist Church community by keeping the affair quiet and silently repenting and praying.This all led up to church officials arranging to pay Miranda for her silence, but once it became clear that they were all lying to her just to cover their own asses, she filed a lawsuit.The church, of course. would rather pretend the affair never took place and released a bullshit statement on Janney s resignation where they stress that him stepping down has nothing to do with the allegations. Pastor Dave Janney resigned as the Senior Pastor effective Sunday, February 7, 2016, not because the allegations against him are true, but because he felt his resignation was in the best interest of the Church. Orlando Baptist Church is saddened by the resignation of Pastor Dave Janney. He leaves with our love and support. As a church we desire to extend grace and love to all, in all that we do. The church will be forming a pulpit committee that will lead in the process of selecting a new pastor. Ultimately our church members will be able to ask questions of, and vote for, any new pastor. In other words, let s not hold the so-called  man of God  accountable for his actions even though they go against everything he preaches.Here s a report of the lawsuit via WFTV.Hilariously enough, Pastor Janney is the same Pastor Janney who participated in a campaign call for Mitt Romney in 2012 with a group of conservative  Christians  who blasted Newt Gingrich for his  moral failures.  You know, because Gingrich had a history of cheating on his wives and then leaving them for the other woman.  When I look at his life I m not concerned about being embarrassed or distracted by his personal issues,  Janney said when he explained his support of Romney over Gingrich three years before inducting himself into the Hypocritical Christian Hall of Fame.Gingrich must be laughing his ass off right about now.

18605,CA: STATE LEGISLATORS Want Traffic Fines To Be Tied To Income…Because Of “Racism”,"Punishing rich, hard-working, white Americans one piece of legislation at a time California s state legislature is considering a bill that would change how the state assess traffic fines. Instead of a flat rate, the state would charge people depending on how much money they made. The less you make, the less you pay.State Senator Robert M. Hertzberg believes California s traffic fines are too high, and the burden is unduly put on low-income families. Many fines, don t even get paid.California is owed almost $10 billion in unpaid traffic fines, something the state tried to chip away at with an amnesty program that would allow violators pay a fraction of what they owe. California s traffic fines are some of the highest in the nation.The report goes on to make the case that the traffic fine system discriminates against poorer individuals thanks to racial profiling by police officers.

4216, Pennsylvania Church Demonstrates How To Deal With A Child-Molesting Pastor,"While many churches defend pastors who have raped or molested children in their congregations, a church in Pennsylvania is showing them what doing the right thing looks like.35-year-old youth pastor Wesley Ryan Blackburn is currently in jail waiting to be tried on  84 felony counts of statutory sexual assault, 84 misdemeanor counts of indecent assault and one felony count of corruption of minors,  according to The Tribune-Democrat.Blackburn worked at Faith Brethren Bible Church in New Paris until last week when he admitted to his wife and state troopers that he impregnated a 15-year-old girl who was a member of the youth group he was teaching.The so-called  man of God  admitted his crimes to his wife after she confronted him about his misconduct. He then told her he didn t love her anymore and demanded a divorce.Blackburn s wife immediately called pastor James Espenshade and told him about her husband s misconduct with the teen girl.But unlike other churches that have stood by pastors who commit sex crimes, the Faith Brethren Bible Church did the right thing and straight up fired Blackburn and called the police. We didn t even care what he had to say,  Espenshade told WAJC.  We don t tolerate this kind of stuff   it s inappropriate, it s reprehensible. There was never a discussion of anything else. We had to do what was right. Police questioned Blackburn while he was packing up his office and he was arrested and charged.The way this church handled Blackburn stands in sharp contrast to the way Columbia Road Baptist Church in North Olmsted, Ohio handled a similar situation.When youth pastor Brian Mitchell, a married man with three kids, was arrested and sentenced to ten years in prison for raping a teen girl, the church not only didn t fire him after discovering inappropriate texts he had been sending her, they continued to stand by him even after he went to prison by blaming the victim and demanding that she apologize to Mitchell s wife.Like Mitchell, Blackburn will probably receive a similar sentence. But Faith Brethren Bible Church deserves praise for calling the police upon learning of Blackburn s misconduct and for immediately terminating his employment. They also deserve praise for not blaming the teenage victim for Blackburn s actions. This is the way churches should handle these situations, but sadly, far too many of them do not.Featured image via Wikimedia",News,"October 13, 2016"

7510, Billionaire Liberal Governor Boosted State’s Economy By Taxing The Rich,"Many Republicans often argue raising the minimum wage or increasing taxes on the rich would kill jobs and hurt the economy, But Minnesota s Democratic Governor, Mark Dayton, completely debunked those arguments in practice.Dayton, a billionaire who s great-grandfather started Dayton s, which would later become Target, inherited a $6.2 billion deficit when he took office as the Governor of Minnesota in 2011 after Republican Governor Tim Pawlenty ran the state into the ground.Dayton was a former U.S. Senator, and of the few to vote against the Iraq War, but he left office disenfranchised with politics in Washington DC, as he felt his liberalism left his hands tied in terms of enacting meaningful legislative reforms.In his home state, he had much better success enacting liberal policies. Governor Dayton reduced the deficit and increased tax revenue by taxing individuals who made more than $150,000 two percent more, from 7.85 percent in state income tax to 9.85 percent, or over $2 billion in extra revenue for the state annually. He also increased the minimum wage and passed an equal pay for women law, despite conservatives in the state criticizing him for these efforts.The result was the creation of over 170,000 new jobs to Minnesota s economy, which now has one of the highest employment rates in the country. The median income in the state is also $8,000 more than the national average. That multi-billion dollar budget deficit he inherited is also now a $1 billion surplus.In contrast, during the same time Wisconsin s Republican Governor Scott Walker broadened poverty levels to the highest they have been in decades by decreasing taxes on the wealthy. Trickle down economics is a myth perpetuated by Republicans that continues to damage our economy and increase poverty. Any conservatives who maintain these arguments should just be pointed to the success Democratic Governor Mark Dayton has had in boosting Minnesota s economy with his progressive reforms, and he implemented them with a Republican controlled State Legislature for his first two years in office.

15110,"BREAKING : Next In Line For Speaker Of The House, RINO Kevin McCarthy Makes Shocking Announcement","Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) has dropped out of the race for House Speaker. The reason he gave to the Republican Caucus for dropping out:  I am not the right person to lead at this moment.  McCarthy was expected to win the Speakership in a landslide but his comments on Benghazi were frowned upon by his fellow Republicans. McCarthy s mistake of saying the Benghazi investigation was all about politics was exactly what Hillary Clinton needed to revive her campaign. Ultimately, he was concerned he could not get the 218 votes needed to win: McCarthy s decision, announced moments before Republicans were set to nominate their candidate, will postpone the vote for speaker. McCarthy had been running against Reps. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, and Daniel Webster, R-Fla., before he dropped out, and it s unclear whether other candidates will now step forward.While McCarthy, R-Calif., faced vocal opposition from some conservative members and groups, he was thought to have more than enough support to win the party s nomination in the vote initially set for Thursday. Fox News is told McCarthy, in revealing his choice, simply told colleagues it was not his time.His withdrawal rattled fellow lawmakers, particularly allies in leadership.

8668, Hilarious: Trevor Noah Has More Fun Than One Guy Should With Last Week’s Debates (VIDEO),"Another huge crowd of Americans tuned in last week as the Republicans held their latest fear-fest, also known as a debate. Refusing to acknowledge that so many people have been tuning in to watch them make fools of themselves and to see what Donald Trump will say next, the GOP field of freaks took the opportunity to once again go at each other s throats for at least half of the debate while invoking fear and bashing Hillary Clinton for the other half.On the flip side, the Democratic debate   held at 9PM on a Sunday night after a long day of playoff football   drew a tenth of the audience but had a thousand times the substance. As the GOP remains focused on having Americans clutch their guns while watching out the front window for ISIS to come knocking on their doors, the Democrats were firmly planted in the world of domestic policy, discussing things that the next president will have the pleasure of dealing with here at home.Both debates had desirable outcomes. The Republicans continued making fools of themselves, alienating more independent voters in the process, in two and a half hours of Clinton bashing, fear-mongering nonsense while the Democrats finally got to see the candidates bear their teeth while Martin O malley interrupted every so often to spread his vision of a world where tree-hugging liberals will stand next to Ammon Bundy for the betterment of humanity.No matter who you support, there was plenty of material from both debates to go around. As comedians and late-night show hosts get back to work, there will be plenty of laughs to be had. Trevor Noah and the team at Comedy Central s Daily Show were the first to hit an absolute home-run with a hilarious segment that includes brutal jabs at the GOP combined with some hilarious Democratic moments as well.Trevor Noah may be having trouble with ratings and people may still not be over the loss of Jon Stewart from their Daily Show fix, but he continues to show why he was Stewart s choice to move his beloved show forward.

7304, Cruz’s Attempt To Act Tough Hilariously Backfires When Reporter Asks Him Brutal Follow-Up (VIDEO),"Poor, poor Ted Cruz. He just can t catch a break.Having endured repeated attacks on his wife by Republican front-runner Donald Trump, Cruz practiced his best  tough guy  face in the mirror, found the nearest camera and told Trump:  Donald, you re a sniveling coward and leave Heidi the hell alone.  And it almost would have worked if it weren t for a meddling NBC reporter who pointed out the massive elephant in the room.Without missing a beat, NBC s Hallie Jackson stepped up to ask the one question Cruz didn t want to hear: Are you more loyal to the Republican Party  or your wife? His flailing response speaks volumes.A clearly unimpressed Jackson asks Cruz to explicitly say whether or not he would support Donald Trump as president if he got the nomination. Cruz was left temporarily speechless, before weakly saying the question was irrelevant because Trump was going to lose. Jackson didn t let up:Jackson: That s not answering the question, Senator.Cruz: I am answering the question. Donald Trump will not be the nominee.Jackson: He s leading right now and you just looked into that camera and said he was a coward. Will you support him as the nominee?Cruz: Donald Trump will not be the nomineeWhat makes Jackson s questions so brutal is that for Cruz, he s always struggled to distance himself from Trump while at the same time copying many of his ideas. And like many Republicans, Cruz has repeatedly said he would support the eventual nominee whoever it was, even as he publicly attacked Trump. Just earlier this month, Cruz was still adamant that party loyalty meant everything. My answer is the same. I committed at the outset. I will support the Republican nominee, whoever it is,  Cruz said.Making things even more awkward, Cruz and Trump spent the early part of the election praising each other. Cruz would live to regret tweets like this one.In the end, with Trump s sizable lead in the primaries, Cruz will need to decide what he will do if Trump wins. As he calls Trump a  sniveling coward  on camera, he may soon be faced with having to grovel at Trump s feet (just as his former fellow candidates Chris Christie and Ben Carson have already done). No doubt when that happens, Cruz is going to wish he never met Hallie Jackson.Featured image via Twitter",News,"March 24, 2016"

3723," Trump ERUPTS At Secret Meeting With The Press, Transition In Chaos (TWEETS)","Donald Trump has had a rocky relationship with the press ever since his presidential campaign, and he s only punished them further for trying to report the truth since becoming the President-elect.On Monday, Trump was set to have an off the record meeting with television networks to try and hash out presidential press access. This meeting was particularly important because Trump has previously limited press access, and has ditched two protocol press pools since getting elected.Some reporters in attendance were NBC s Deborah Turness, Lester Holt and Chuck Todd; ABC s James Goldston, George Stephanopoulos, David Muir and Martha Raddatz; CBS  Norah O Donnell and Charlie Rose; Fox News  Bill Shine, Jack Abernethy, Jay Wallace, Suzanne Scott; MSNBC s Phil Griffin; and CNN s Jeff Zucker and Erin Burnett. It was a good group, and it could have been a very effective meeting if only things had gone according to plan.Unfortunately, instead of having a respectful conversation and coming up with an amicable way to move forward, what the press got was a baby Trump temper tantrum of epic proportions. Or, as one person put it,  It was like a f*cking firing squad. Trump made zero attempt to hide his disrespect for the media. According to The New York Post, one anonymous source said: The meeting was a total disaster. The TV execs and anchors went in there thinking they would be discussing the access they would get to the Trump administration, but instead they got a Trump-style dressing down. This claim was backed up by another person, who said: The meeting took place in a big board room and there were about 30 or 40 people, including the big news anchors from all the networks. Trump kept saying,  We re in a room of liars, the deceitful dishonest media who got it all wrong. He addressed everyone in the room calling the media dishonest, deceitful liars. He called out Jeff Zucker by name and said everyone at CNN was a liar, and CNN was network of liars. This attack left reporters stunned, and even as they tried to keep bringing up press access to stay on topic, Trump barely let them speak. While this is certainly shocking, this behavior is completely typical of Trump. He has always hated the free press because it has held him accountable and reported on his mistakes and shortcomings.Americans on social media are already coming to terms with how terrifying this is:TwitterTwitterTwitterInterestingly enough, Trump spokeswoman Kellyanne Conway had the nerve to say the meeting went well. She said: Excellent meetings with the top executives of the major networks. Pretty unprecedented meeting we put together in two days.

17281,BREAKING VIDEO: DHS WHISTLEBLOWER TESTIFIES OF HARASSMENT AND LOSS OF GUN RIGHTS,"Wow! This is big and has to do with telling the truth about the EB-5 visa program:A Department of Homeland Security watchdog report issued Tuesday blasted the agency s No. 2 official for repeatedly intervening on behalf of well-connected participants in an investor-visa program, including Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D-Va.) and Tony Rodham, a brother of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.The inspector general report faults Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas for creating  an appearance of favoritism and special access  as a result of highly unusual steps he took while serving as director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which oversaw the investment-based program known as EB-5.WHISTLEBLOWER HARASSED AND ABUSED:They took her right to carry a weapon away and harassed her. This woman is very brave to testify! Hopefully, they will keep on digging into this and find out everything they need to. Great job Taylor! Taylor Johnson, a senior special agent in the Homeland Security Investigations division of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified at a Senate hearing alongside whistleblowers from several other agencies who claim to have faced similar harassment.Johnson told lawmakers she ran into resistance after investigating the so-called EB-5 program, which offers visas to investors. She said she looked into the program over concerns about security risks, questioning whether visas were being approved with little scrutiny.But Johnson said her managers began to hear complaints about her queries. Soon, she was removed from the investigation, and the case was closed.From there, it got worse.Johnson told the Senate Homeland Security Committee her  weapon and credentials  were taken, her government vehicle was confiscated, and her access to the building where she worked and government databases was revoked.Further, she said,  I was told I couldn t even carry or own a personal weapon, which is a constitutional rights violation.

3946, Mike Huckabee Just Tried To Compliment Trump And COMPLETELY F***ed It Up (TWEETS),"Republican nominee Donald Trump definitely has the worst surrogates out of anyone who has ever run for President. They can barely keep their stories (lies) straight, and have a really difficult time talking positively about their candidate at this point in the race, after his campaign as been riddled with scandals, lawsuits, and sexual assault allegations.Something absolutely ridiculous happened today on Twitter when former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee decided to make a case for why Trump was the better candidate for President. As expected, this pathetic attempt at some Trump praise went horribly wrong when Huckabee referred to Trump as a  car wreck    but at least one that s  pointed in the right direction.  Huckabee tried to argue that this was better than Clinton, who he described as  a drunk driver going the wrong way down the freeway. TwitterNot only is the metaphor problematic   as the former presidential candidate is already saying that Trump has ruined everything in a crash   but it didn t take long before Twitter users tore the metaphor and Huckabee s reasoning to shreds:TwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterHuckabee s weird compliment is so reminiscent of what happens with many of Trump s surrogates. Another former rival-turned-supporter, Ben Carson, has become infamous for giving Trump back-handed compliments. And as Trump s campaign continued on, we witnessed Trump s supporters having a more difficult time defending the business mogul s erratic behavior and insane statements.Huckabee   and many other Republicans that continue to support Trump   know that he s an absolute disaster for the GOP, but they d rather stay loyal to their party and worry about the Supreme Court than actually do what s best for America. Huckabee called Trump exactly what he was in his tweet   a wreck   and any GOPer who is aware of this and continues to support Trump is as unethical and spineless as he is.Featured image via Christopher Furlong/Getty Images",News,"November 4, 2016"

19248,"WOMAN Who Wants To Become DNC Chair: “My job is to shut other white people down when they say, ‘Oh no, I’m not prejudiced!'”[VIDEO]","The Democratic Party held a forum for race obsessed nut-jobs candidates who are running to become the new DNC Chair. The DNC Chair will replace Debbie Wasserman Schultz who was fired (took the fall for Hillary) when it was discovered through leaks in the hacked DNC emails that she helped to rig the primary election against Bernie Sanders to ensure a Hillary win. For a brief period of time, Donna Brazile was the interim replacement for Wasserman-Schultz, until she was caught passing debate questions to Hillary in advance of the debate while working as a commentator at CNN.It seems that the DNC has had a string of bad luck when it comes to finding an honest person to run their party. But who needs honesty when you re a Democrat right? All you need is to be able to effectively pander to minorities right? I mean, it worked so well for Hillary after all Watch Sally Boynton Brown pander to the minorities in the crowd during a forum that gave candidates a chance to tell everyone why they believe they are the best candidate for the job. It appears she has a single agenda, to  shut white people up.  The funny thing is, there are two black candidates sitting behind her who don t seem to be impressed with her speech until she starts talking about  shutting white people down,  at which time you can see their demeanor change and smiles can be seen from ear to ear. 8 years ago, this would have been seen as a partisan and unnecessarily divisive speech. But this isn t 8 years ago. This is post divisive-Obama and it will take years to unwind the mistrust, hate and division he has created between races that didn t previously exist.https://youtu.be/TCeoC7P7WmoSally Boyton Brown should have been laughed off the stage for her ridiculous claim that a white person is not allowed to say they have black friends without also admitting they re  racists . Instead, the audience and the candidates behind her clap like seals in approval of a false narrative driven almost exclusively by Democrats for the purpose of keeping America divided, as they falsely believe this will somehow be the key to keeping them in power.

123," Miss Texas Gave A VERY Unexpected Answer When Asked About Trump, And Republicans Are Furious","Long before Cara Mund,  Miss North Dakota,  won the 2018 Miss America pageant, she faced a crowd of 50 other young women, all competing in various categories for the coveted crown. Two of those categories, to most of our readers, are patriarchal and silly: The evening wear and swimwear  competitions  pit all these beautiful young women against one another for assessment on their looks by a panel of judges.The other two categories, however, can be quite interesting, especially when something happens like what went down with Miss Texas in this year s competition.The talent portion of the show is, of course, just plain entertaining. Perhaps you ve seen the movie Miss Congeniality, starring Sandra Bullock, and if you have, you know what I m hoping to see in a talent show. The real thing is very little like that, however, and so is the interview portion of Miss America. Source: Meme Central, a folder on my computerTonight, Miss Texas was no Miss Rhode Island. There were two rounds of questions this time around, and when Margana Wood was called on for the second, more serious question, she got a doozy. Drawing a judge s name from a dish, she pulled Jess Cagle, the editor-in-chief of People Magazine. Cagle wasted zero time getting right to it: Last month, a demonstration of neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and the KKK in Charlottesville, Virginia turned violent and a counter-protester was killed. The president said there was shared blame with, quote,  very fine people on both sides.  Were there? Tell me yes or no, and explain. Well, then. That s a far cry from every participant simply answering  World Peace!  whenever their turn came around to say the one thing to the world they had in their heart. Ms. Wood was not, as they say, f*cking around. Barely containing her anger, Margana turned it up to 11: I think that the white supremacist issue, it was very obvious that it was a terrorist attack. And I think that president Donald Trump should have made a statement on it earlier, addressing the fact, and making sure all Americans feel safe in this country. That is the number one issue right now. Naturally, Republicans were butthurt.

4311, Trump Tried To FIRE The Woman He Worked So Hard To Sleep With After She Spurned Him,"The woman that Trump claimed he tried so hard to sleep, and admittedly failed to do so, is Nancy O Dell, who hosted the Miss USA pageant in 2004 and 2005. Trump spoke of sexually assaulting her in 2005, but what many may not know is that he apparently tried to have her fired after that.At the time, he said he didn t like the way she looked while she was pregnant. TMZ reported, back in 2007, that Trump couldn t do that. O Dell s contract was with NBC, not with Trump, and he got overruled. O Dell kept her job, and Trump got to sulk in the background.So the  official  reason for wanting to fire her was that he didn t like the way she looked pregnant. Knowing Trump, though, he was butthurt that she d spurned him and wanted to punish her for the audacity. This is the man that pretended to be a PR person to hype up his own prowess with women back in the early  90s, after all.Trump claims he was just joking with Billy Bush on an  Access Hollywood  bus when the ahem disgustingly unfortunate comments about assaulting O Dell were made. O Dell was slated to host Miss USA with Bush that year, making this all the more terrible.Billy Bush is now a co-host of NBC s  Today Show,  and is probably in some hot water, considering this is the third time he s given NBC problems. He issued an apology for his role in pushing sexual harassment and assault as something men can just do when they re famous, saying: I was younger, less mature, and acted foolishly in playing along. I m very sorry. Yeah, younger and less mature totally excuses this. It also totally excuses trying to fire her afterward. Trump s true motives may never be known, but it s highly suspicious, and knowing Trump, it s because her rejection just rankled him and he had to put her in her place.Photo of Donald Trump by Ralph Freso/Getty Images.

11604,BRAVE SWEDISH JOURNALISTS CONFIRM That Trump Is Dead On About Sweden [Video],"SUBTITLED VIDEO:HERE S ANOTHER JOURNALIST S TAKE ON WHAT S HAPPENED TO SWEDEN: SWEDEN: FROM ABBA TO ALLAH In the 1970s Sweden was a stable and wealthy country that was admired by many outsiders. It had international pop artists such as ABBA, sports stars like Bj rn Borg and Ingemar Stenmark as well as Volvo cars. Some outsiders still maintain this rosy image. In 2016, Sweden was still ranked as the world s   goodest   country.Unfortunately, being  good  in the Western world today seems to mean being suicidal.In just two generations, Sweden has become an increasingly dysfunctional and crime-ridden country. The main cause of this negative transformation is non-European mass immigration.I have been chronicling Sweden s decline for many years. My reports were falsely dismissed as fantasies made by an alleged  right-wing extremist.  This denial is no longer possible.Many alternative media and independent websites are now describing these issues. Major media in Britain, Germany, the USA and even in Russia have also finally discovered Sweden s Multicultural problems. This is causing huge embarrassment to the ruling elites in Sweden. They are used to being admired. They are not accustomed to international ridicule, or being viewed as an example of what not to do.Events reached a peak when U.S. President Donald Trump publicly made negative remarks about the problems in Sweden. The Social Democratic Prime Minister Stefan L fven has repeatedly rejected suggestions that the authorities have lost control. On February 20, 2017, the former Prime Minister Carl Bildt accused President Trump of   engaging in misinformation and slander  against Sweden. That very same night, violent riots once again erupted in one of the no-go zones near Stockholm that allegedly do not exist.Car burning in Sweden, January 2017 All former Swedish governments since the 1970s, including those led by Mr. Bildt and Mr. L fven, have directly contributed to the massive problems Sweden is currently facing.Carl Bildt served as Prime Minister of Sweden from 1991 to 1994. He was in charge of a center-right coalition government by Swedish standards. Bildt served as Minister for Foreign Affairs between 2006 and 2014 in the center-right coalition of PM Fredrik Reinfeldt. These governments also continued mass immigration, just as the Socialist Prime Ministers Olof Palme, Ingvar Carlsson, G ran Persson and Stefan L fven did.The Swedish author Astrid Lindgren published the first stories about Pippi Longstocking in the 1940s. If they were updated for today, perhaps Pippi would have to flee from the suburbs of a Swedish city after having been gang raped by immigrant boys. Alternatively, she might have been a radical Feminist who donned the Islamic veil in order to express her solidarity with the Muslims who are colonizing her country.The Swedish mass media and political elites are very careful not to suggest any connection between rapes and mass immigration from Third World countries. Yet there is every reason to suspect that such a connection exists. We know from other Western European countries that immigrants from certain regions and cultures, particularly from the Islamic world and Africa, are disproportionately represented as perpetrators in rape cases.READ MORE: GATE OF VIENNA",politics,"Feb 22, 2017"

Chris Cox, Founder of Bikers for TrumpWhile the Dems throw money at their candidate, the Republicans are bringing in the Bikers for Trump to go door to door in Georgia for Republican candidate Karen Handel.This race has gotten pretty ugly with vulgar letters containing white powder sent to Handel s neighbors. The left is really counting on this win but the vitriol only wins votes for Handel.Here s the note put in mailboxes in Handel s neighborhood   LANGUAGE ALERT!Much has been made of the fact that Handel s challenger doesn t even live in the district he s running in!FEAR MONGERING TO GET VOTES:Rep. John Lewis (D-GA) stood in front of 50 Jon Ossoff volunteers at a campaign barbecue and fear mongered to get the message out: The vote is precious and sacred. It is the most powerful nonviolent tool we have,  he said.  There are some in this country who still seek to deny some of us our right to vote. We can fight back by exercising that right. NOTE TO JOHN LEWIS: NO ONE IS TRYING TO DENY ANYONE S VOTE! MARIETTA, Ga.   This neighborhood might have gotten quite a jolt when Bikers for Trump   sporting tattoos galore, black vests and a massive flag with the group s insignia   showed up in this Atlanta suburb to politely ask people to vote for the Republican candidate in this week s special congressional election.At one stop, Chris Hummel and his wife, Karen, assured Chris Cox, founder of Bikers for Trump, and the six other men and women who were going door to door that they had voted early for the Republican, Karen Handel, over Democrat Jon Ossoff. Mrs. Hummel even shed some tears after learning that three of the bikers had served in the military. Her father served as a battalion leader in the Vietnam War and returned a different man. Years later, when Mrs. Hummel was a baby, he took his own life. We have heard about them,  Mrs. Hummel said about the group.  I just think it is cool that it is just kind of grass-roots door-to-door, just common folks. Because that is really what America is.  Mr. Cox and his crew of volunteers had visited this well-groomed neighborhood before and returned Tuesday to make certain that its heavily Republican voters planned to   or already had   voted for Mrs. Handel. The bikers are hoping to punch a hole in the Democrat-driven storyline that President Trump s supporters are turning their backs on him. For us, it is more about  Support Donald Trump,  and by supporting Karen Handel we are supporting Donald Trump,  said Mr. Cox, standing in a cul-de-sac next to his Harley-Davidson motorcycle and steps away from a miniature soccer goal.

16729,"OBAMA GIVES ILLEGAL ALIENS IN FLINT, MI Amnesty So They Can Get Free Sh*t From Taxpayers","Because people who scale border walls and break the law to get into our country deserve the same taxpayer funded benefits as legal citizens right?Caving into the demands of the open borders movement and pro-immigrant Spanish media, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will refrain from enforcing immigration laws in areas of Flint, Michigan affected by a water crisis. The water amnesty is the latest of many reprieves issued by the Obama administration to help illegal immigrants nationwide. Judicial Watch has reported on many of them, including recent hurricane, earthquake, Ebola and  severe weather  amnesties.This one involves the widely reported water situation in Flint, which is located about 66 miles northwest of Detroit. Last year researchers discovered that the city s drinking water was contaminated with lead from decaying old pipes. The problem arose after a switch in 2014 in the city s water source to save money. Soon complaints mounted that the water smelled and looked strange and academic researchers discovered that it was toxic. This all occurred after a 7-1 vote by the Flint City Council to stop buying Detroit water and join a new pipeline project, according to a local news report.Now there s a state of emergency and the feds have stepped in, supplying the area with free bottled water and special filters to install at home until the local water supply is clean. For weeks immigrant rights groups complained that residents had to show identification to receive their free goods from the government and illegal aliens were being left out. National Spanish-language media outlets blasted the Obama administration for discriminating against illegal aliens. One reported that undocumented immigrants weren t getting help for fear of being deported, instead opting to drink contaminated water or pay out of pocket to buy some. Another major Spanish-language newspaper wrote that illegal immigrants and their children suffered lead poisoning and couldn t get clean emergency water because they didn t have identification cards.  When the National Guard went door to door distributing potable water, many were scared to open because they feared the uniformed persons were immigration agents who would deport them,  the paper wrote.The Anti-Defamation League (ADL), which claims to combat bigotry and protect civil rights for all, joined the cause expressing  horror  and  indignation  that the government denied undocumented immigrants free water and filters because they couldn t provide a photo ID or Social Security number. In a Spanish-language statement the group s Michigan chapter referred to news reports that Flint-area fire department stations distributing water were requiring identification. But even in places that aren t requiring ID, illegal immigrants are scared to come out and get their potable water out of fear that they will be deported, the ADL stresses in its announcement.  We are calling on the National Guard to order all fire departments and other centers distributing supplies that no one be rejected. Like a good lapdog the Obama administration obliged. This week DHS issued a statement in English and Spanish guaranteeing that U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) would not conduct enforcement operations at or near locations distributing clean water in Flint or surrounding areas.  Moreover, DHS officials do not and will not pose as individuals providing water-related information or distributing clean water as part of any enforcement activities,  the statement assures. The agency s priority is to support state and local government efforts to distribute clean water, the statement says, adding that DHS stands  ready to assist those in need.

2399, Bradley Whitford Perfectly Articulates How We’re All Feeling About Trump’s Presidency; It’s AWESOME (VIDEO),"On Thursday night, actor Bradley Whitford, of Transparent and West Wing fame, stopped by the Late Show to speak with Stephen Colbert. It just so happens that Colbert had adorable adoptable puppies there on the set Thursday night as well, and Whitford brought one out with him for his interview.Whitford explained that the puppy, Tucker, was calming him down, and that the little animal was helping him deal with Donald Trump s presidency. Whitford said: I need a service dog, since the election. Colbert reminded Whitford that the actor had already been in full-blown  Trump panic  back in September, and then proceeded to ask him how he is now. Whitford said: This is calming me, but I do want to reiterate that our president was a birther, which is racist and un-American. And we have a white nationalist working in the White House, and they have conflated refugees with terrorism, and now they are picking on transgender people. It s not a joke, and it s very upsetting. Colbert went on to share some of Whitford s large number of political tweets, which are coming these days in a seemingly unending stream. His profile photo also shows him in a pink  pussy hat  from the historic Women s March.I am so happy that this man articulated what so many of us are feeling these days. I d like one of those puppies to get me through the next four years as well.Watch the video below:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"February 24, 2017"
1368, Monica Lewinsky Wrote An Obituary For Roger Ailes And It Was BRUTAL,"Last week, disgraced former Fox News chief, Roger Ailes, died. I know you re supposed to speak reverentially about the dead, but Ailes was toxic. He was a misogynist, a racist and he turned low information voters into a key demographic. Without Roger Ailes, we would likely not have had two illegal wars and we wouldn t have BLOTUS Trump.For some, though, their toxic relationship with Ailes was far more personal. One notable example of a life he ruined was Monica Lewinsky, who, to this day, is best known as the woman who gave Bill Clinton a blow job. Lewinsky penned her own obituary for Ailes, and there was no reverence. There was resentment and a whole lot of truth. This is not another obituary for Roger Ailes,  Lewinsky wrote,  who died last week 10 months after being ousted at Fox News. It is, I hope, instead an obituary for the culture he purveyed   a culture that affected me profoundly and personally. Hard to deny that. Thanks to Fox News, a consensual affair suddenly became the scandal of the decade   it was the story that was supposed to undo a presidency. Without Lewinsky, Fox News might not be Fox News today.Some experts have noted that viewers found Fox for the first time because of the crisis. John Moody, a Fox executive editor, reflected on that period:  The Lewinsky saga put us on the news map.  As he put it in another interview:  Monica was a news channel s dream come true. But amid that, Fox created the culture of mean. They somehow managed to portray Bill Clinton as a predator (ironic given the culture at Fox News) while portraying Lewinsky as unworthy of a powerful man s attentions.Their dream was my nightmare. My character, my looks and my life were picked apart mercilessly. Truth and fiction mixed at random in the service of higher ratings. My family and I huddled at home, worried about my going to jail   I was the original target of Ken Starr s investigation, threatened with 27 years for having been accused of signing a false affidavit, obstructing justice, suborning perjury and other crimes   or worse, me taking my own life. Meantime, Mr. Ailes huddled with his employees at Fox News, dictating a lineup of talking heads to best exploit this personal and national tragedy.Lewinsky lamented the fact that it wasn t only Fox, and that Fox changed the media landscape. Even MSNBC was committed to almost non-stop coverage of the scandal that shouldn t have been. The internet, though, made it much, much worse.Just as television news was devolving into a modern coliseum, the internet came along and compounded this culture of shame and vitriol. Remember: The story of my affair was not broken by The Washington Post, The New York Times or the networks, but online by the Drudge Report. The comments on television and online were excruciating. I ceased being a three-dimensional person. Instead I became a whore, a bimbo, a slut and worse. Just days after the story broke, Fox asked its viewers to vote on this pressing question: Is Monica Lewinsky an  average girl  or a  young tramp looking for thrills ?Lewinsky isn t cheering for Fox News to be cancelled. In fact, she praised them for firing Ailes and Bill O Reilly, both of whom were accused of being serial sexual harassers. She also said she believes that credible conservative voices should be heard, that it s an important part of a healthy democracy. However, Ailes helped create the current cruel and toxic political environment, and for that, he won t be missed.Featured image of Monica Lewinsky via Bryan Bedder/Getty Images | Featured image of Roger Ailes via Handout/Getty Images.",News,"May 22, 2017"
12126,RUSSIA Tells Sore Loser Obama To Produce Some Proof [Russian hacking of emails] Or Stop Talking About It!…Trump Tweets Brilliant Response,"The Russians may not have hacked our elections, but that s not going stop Obama from blaming them for affecting Hillary s chances of winning. Never mind Hillary s recent use of an unsecured email server while she was serving as Sec of State, or the fact that she has spent most of her adult life under some sort of criminal investigation, or that over half of America said they didn t trust her. It s the damn Russians fault that Wikileaks leaked emails that were damaging to Hillary, her entire campaign team and the Democratic Party. Anything to taint the legitimacy of soon to be President Trump. President Obama said the United States will retaliate against Russia over its malicious cyberactivity during this year s election, in an interview that will air Friday on NPR. I think there is no doubt that when any foreign government tries to impact the integrity of our elections . . . we need to take action,  the president said.  And we will   at a time and place of our own choosing. Some of it may be explicit and publicized; some of it may not be. Speaking to  Morning Edition  host Steve Inskeep, Obama said  there are still a whole range of assessments taking place among the agencies,  and he is waiting for the report on cyberattacks he has ordered to be delivered by Jan. 20.Russia seems to be losing their patience with the Obama regime s  claims  that they had something to do with the hacked emails that Wikileaks founder Julian Assange shared with the world prior to our November elections.The tough talk from the White House fell flat in Moscow, where Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called the accusations baseless and inappropriate. They should either stop talking about that or produce some proof at last,  Peskov told reporters Friday.  Otherwise it all begins to look unseemly. There has been no specific, persuasive evidence shared publicly about the extent of Putin s role or knowledge of any hackings. That lack of proof undercuts Democrats  strategy to portray Putin s involvement as irrefutable evidence of a directed Russian government plot to undermine America s democratic system.But the White House pointed to a U.S. intelligence assessment released publicly in October that asserted  only Russia s senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.  And Obama s deputy national security adviser, Ben Rhodes, connected the dots further, saying Thursday that Putin was responsible for the Russian government s actions. I don t think things happen in the Russian government of this consequence without Vladimir Putin knowing about it,  he told MSNBC.Trump struck back Friday morning, with a Twitter post mockingly asking,  are we talking about the same cyberattack  in which embarrassing information about the Democratic National Committee was also revealed.Are we talking about the same cyberattack where it was revealed that head of the DNC illegally gave Hillary the questions to the debate?

7027, WATCH: Donald Trump Receives Endorsement From Neo-Nazis in CRAZY New Video,"Donald Trump has attracted all sorts of fringe individuals and organizations as of late. He s attracted the most extreme elements of the Republican Party, and even the Ku Klux Klan is on board with his demonization of minorities and women. Now, Trump s extremist fan base has gone international with an endorsement from  Golden Dawn members, a far right neo-Nazi party in Greece which has a presence in the Greek parliament. In the new video, Trump is praised as a man who  doesn t fear to speak the truth. Watch video here:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCwXFVhe6DE]Ilias Panagiotaros is a leading member of the party and he s on board with Trump s policies. Penagitaros has praised Hitler for having a  great personality.  Panagiotaros, along with Golden Dawn, has been linked to multiple offenses like murder, aggravated assault, trafficking, kidnapping, money laundering and extortion by the Greek government.Of particular excitement to Panagiotaros is when Trump infamously used a Mussolini quote to describe himself and then defended himself from the outrage, saying,  What difference does it make if it was Mussolini or somebody else,  Trump said.  It s a very good quote. As a result of the Greek economic collapse and the Syrian refugee crisis, Golden Dawn, which has an anti-capitalist platform and is anti-immigration, has gained more of a following. Thus, it should be of no surprise that Donald Trump has some racist fans in the international arena since his platform of denying Muslims entry into the US and building a wall to keep Mexicans out are comparable to that of this organization.The hope is that Donald Trump, along with the creepy Ted Cruz, who is likely even more racist than Trump with his personal brand of xenophobia, will never get to the presidency because if one of these men do, this country and its people are in deep trouble.

Guilfoyle talked about the media and how they attacked President Trump for retweeting a hilarious video made to look like he was body-slamming CNN, while ignoring the Central Park play where President Trump was stabbed to death on the stage in front of thousands.Huckabee told Kimberly Guilfoyle he was proud of his daughter and how she s handled the constant attacks by the media. Huckabee gave a hilarious example of why he believes his daughter is able to handle the leftist media so well: I think my daughter is handling this very well because she has three preschoolers at home. So she s used to dealing with petulant children who ask the same question over and over hoping to get a different answer, the one that they want. And so maybe that s part of the reason she s able to stay flat-footed, look those folks in the eye and handle it. ",politics,"Jul 4, 2017"

22170,MSNBC #FakeNews Fail: Desperate Rachel Maddow Springs Trump’s Tax Trap,"This was Rachel Maddow s Geraldo Rivera moment. On Tuesday night the shrill MSNBC host baited audiences with an extended monologue, where she could be seen wringing her hands in anticipation of  the big one    a scene of hype and overindulgence by the media which was reminiscent of Geraldo Rivera  epic flop, Al Capone s Vaults which aired back in 1986.What followed was almost too ridiculous to comment on. This was mainstream media fake news at its absolute finest.Maddow shows up on air holding the cover pages of Donald Trump s 2005 federal income tax returns. The only problem was that it showed Trump paying more tax than most people   he paid $38 million in federal taxes on only $150 million in income that year   a higher rate than was paid by Bernie Sanders, Barack Obama, and even MSNBC itself.Newsbusters reports:  Wednesday afternoon, MSNBC s Rachel Maddow gave an interview to the Associated Press defending her actions following her epic fail regarding the tease and reveal of President Trump s 2005 tax returns by blaming viewers for overblowing the revelation. Maddow spoke to the AP s David Bauder (who, to be transparent, has frequently cited and quoted members of the MRC in the past) and, in Bauder s summation,  says that if people felt let down by her story about President Donald Trump s 2005 tax document it s more because of the weight of expectation than anything she did. Bauder noted how a tweet from her account 90 minutes prior to her show  set off a social media frenzy  and thus  expectations were sky high. It turns out that these  leaked  IRS papers were placed in the mailbox of none other than one of Hillary Clinton s anointed campaign journalists, Michael Cay Johnston   who, with the help of Amy Goodman at Democracy Now! last summer, promoted the accusation that then presidential candidate Trump has committed tax fraud. It appears that Johnston was so excited to be the first to get a hold of at least part of Trump s tax returns that he didn t bother to consider that a Trump operative may have place this big find in his mail box.Watch as Maddow and Johnston labor over this non-story, in one of the most hyped media fails in recent memory: SUPPORT OUR WORK BY SUBSCRIBING & BECOMING A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",US_News,"March 16, 2017"
272, Trump: Mass Shootings Will Stop If Americans Unite And Pray For Peace,"Clearly, Donald Trump intends to do absolutely nothing to prevent future mass shootings.The Las Vegas mass shooting is the deadliest in American history. Fifty people are dead and over 400 are wounded after a gunman used a machine gun to mow people down from his hotel room at Mandalay Bay as 22,000 concertgoers fled for their lives.Predictably, the National Rifle Association has remained silent and Republicans like Trump are only offering  thoughts and prayers  instead of taking meaningful action.Trump fumbled his first response to the shooting by offering his  warmest condolences  on Twitter. Of course, we all know that if the shooter were brown with a Muslim sounding name Trump would be calling this an act of terror and would be once again calling for a Muslim ban.But this shooter was an old white guy who used an assault rifle so the terrorism label won t be used and there will be no call for a gun ban by Trump.And that was made further clear by Trump s remarks to the nation this morning as he suggested that the only real way to stop these violent acts is to unite in prayer for peace. In moments of tragedy and horror, America comes together as one. And it always has. We call upon the bonds that unite us, our faith, our family, and our shared values. We call upon the bonds of citizenship, the ties of community, and the comfort of our common humanity. Our unity cannot be shattered by evil, our bonds cannot be broken by violence, and though we feel such great anger, at the senseless murder of our fellow citizens, it is our love that defines us today. And always will. Forever We pray for the entire nation to find unity and peace. And we pray for the day when evil is banished and the innocent are safe from hatred and from fear. Here s the video of Trump s full remarks via YouTube.Not once did Trump call this an act of terrorism. Not once did Trump mention the need for gun control. He said the word  pray  an insufferable amount of times as if prayer is the solution to gun violence. The only thing he offered these victims was prayers and a reference to the Bible and God.That s unacceptable. It s time for Republicans to acknowledge that white men commit acts of terror and it s time for them to ignore the NRA and do something to prevent future tragedies like this from occurring.This was an opportunity for Trump to actually do something courageous in response to tragedy. He failed spectacularly as usual. Thoughts, prayers, and God will not prevent mass shootings. We need gun control measures now more than ever and a renewed focus on stopping home-grown domestic terrorists. The American people need real action, not false platitudes.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"October 2, 2017"

5366, Police Officer Warns About White Cops ‘Looking For A Reason To Kill A Black Man’ (IMAGE),"A black Cincinnati police officer is currently receiving backlash over a controversial Facebook post where he warned his African-American friends and family about white officers that may be targeting them because of their race.Officer Freddie Vincent had shared the message earlier this month, which instructed black people on what to do if they happen to get stopped by police. The post read: A message to all my Afro America friends and family. When you are encountered by a white officer make sure that you are in a public place, and comply to all of their commands, because they are looking for a reason to kill a black man. And always keep your hands in the air, and never resist. I m so tired of cops using these famous words  I was in fear of my life.  I m praying for Louisiana, that could have been my nephew in B.R. FacebookThis post was written after the high profile police brutality incidents in Louisiana and Minnesota, so it is perfectly understandable why those tragedies would be weighing on Vincent s heart and he would want to warn his loved ones of the dangers they might encounter. Vincent also had other posts on his Facebook account that addressed police brutality. One of them, posted on July 12, was an illustration on 10 rules of survival if stopped by the police.  Vincent commented over the illustration: I can t promise you that this is 100% true, but it s about 85% to 95% and you just might make it home safely. Unfortunately, Vincent s post has landed him in hot water. According to Cincinnati Police Chief Eliot Isaac, Vincent s post is being reviewed to see if it falls within the department s  social media procedure and our rules and regulations.  In a statement, Isaac said: The Cincinnati Police Department strives to maintain a culture of professionalism, as well as transparency and accountability for our actions. I am proud of the work of the men and women of the Cincinnati Police Department and our efforts to work collaboratively with the community. We are aware of a recent post to a commonly used social media site by one of our officers that refers to an interpretation of a law enforcement officer s actions. The comments that were posted are under review as they relate to our Social Media procedure and our Rules and Regulations. A panel discussion was later held at New Prospect Baptist Church in Roselawn, where an audience asked Isaac if there was racism in the Cincinnati Police Department. Isaac responded: I don t think anyone can say there is not racism inside the department. Vincent s post may be even more prominent now, as we are seeing situations where black men are doing everything that police tell them to, and still being shot. Just earlier this week, unarmed black man Charles Kinsey was shot with his hands in the air while trying to take care of a patient with autism. Fortunately, Kinsey lived but many are not so lucky. Referencing Kinsey s incident, Bishop Bobby Hilton of Word of Deliverance Ministries and president of the local chapter of civil rights group National Action Network commented on this horrific incident: When there is a hint of this, that we have police officers who have this thought process about black men, these officers have to be dismissed. We are now seeing situations in Minnesota and Florida, where black men are doing what they are told by police   putting their hands up, complying with all instructions   and they are still shot. It s understandable why Vincent s posts have caused a stir, but to pretend that there wasn t some truth to what he was saying is ignorant. African Americans have been targeted and mistreated by police for far too long, and it is a situation that must be addressed.Featured image via Flickr",News,"July 22, 2016"
14029,VIOLENT LEFT EXPOSED: Anti-Trump Latino Sprays Pepper Spray In Faces Of Pro-Trump Women and Children,"This is what it looks like when the  tolerant  Left uses violence to promote their phony  tolerance  for others .A loser in the Seattle Seahawks t-shirt really hates Donald Trump. Because he s too stupid to verbalize his position and too cowardly to take on anyone his own size or gender, he decided to express his displeasure with the GOP frontrunner by pepper spraying some women and children at a Pro-Trump rally.Here s the deal: Anaheim, CA city councilwoman Kris Murray introduced a resolution denouncing Donald Trump, which reads in part,  the divisive rhetoric of presidential candidate Donald Trump as contrary to the fundamental principles of the constitutions of California and the United States and as not reflecting Anaheim s guiding principles of inclusiveness and kindness. The LA Daily News reports that more than 50 pro-Trump supporters showed up at the Anaheim City Hall to protest this ridiculous resolution on Tuesday. As you know, wherever there are Trump supporters, there are anti-Trump agitators looking to start a violent confrontation. There s no word on the anti-Trump numbers, but there were enough to be noticed. The news notes that most of these anti-Trump forces were angry young men.As the anti-Trump thugs were yelling at the pro-Trump supporters, one asshole decided to attack a group of women and children, including a 53-year-old grandmother. All I remember is a young man jumped on one of my friends and I told him to get off. Then I got pepper sprayed,  said Linda Reedy.That pepper spray was wielded by the Latino in the Seahawks shirt. Not only did he hit Reedy but also her two young grandchildren and another woman.Paramedics were seen pouring water on their eyes to try and remove the stinging spray. A young girl about 8 years old cried hysterically.It would appear as if someone, possibly Seahawks guy, also punched Reedy in the face as paramedics gave her an icepack for an unspecified facial injury.To recap: one guy attacked a woman and then the Latino pepper sprayed her, a grandmother, and two young children all because they support Donald Trump. If there are a bigger couple of pussies I d like to know who they are because these guys have the #1 and #2 spots locked up in my opinion.Despite the fact that the news was able to capture a very clear picture of the chickenshit pepper sprayer, the dozens of police on the scene were unable to identify or arrest him. No seriously, there were a dozen cops in riot gear, plus many more guarding City Hall, as well as police helicopters overhead and they couldn t apprehend this coward?Let s remember that the reason why everyone was at Anaheim City Hall was because some uppity leftist councilwoman was denouncing Trump for being intolerant. Somehow I think attacking and pepper spraying old women and young children for their beliefs is a million times less tolerant than anything Donald Trump has ever said. Will Anaheim also denounce this Latino asshole and his cohort for what they did? I doubt it.A better question is: will the national media report this assault with the same vigor that they do any time a disruptive idiot gets thrown out of a Trump rally? Again, I doubt it. The official media narrative is that Donald Trump supporters are the violent ones and anti-Trump protesters are peaceful victims of their hate.Via: DownTrend",politics,"Apr 27, 2016"
8893, Numbskull Ben Carson Just Managed To P*ss Off Every Decent Parent In America,"Ben Carson may be the dumbest person ever to perform brain surgery. He has proven time and time again that he has no clue on matters of simple science issue,s and has demonstrated a lack of critical thinking skills that have landed in the  pants on fire  category of fact checkers on numerous occasions.His stories about growing up some street-wary tough guy who liked to beat and stab people turned out to be fabrications. His tales of being held at gunpoint couldn t be verified by anyone. The only thing Carson has ever said that seems even remotely true is that he often felt like the  dumb kid  in class. He likes to follow it up with how he persevered and became a brain surgeon.Whatever it was that pushed Ben Carson through medical school and into a fellowship at one of the world s most prestigious hospitals was definitely not his ability to think on the fly. Left unscripted and with a microphone, Carson is his own worst enemy.

Without considering that he was dealing with 10-year-olds, Carson actually asked the class to point to the worst student among them. A Des Moines Register reporter tweeted that at least half a dozen kids in the class singled out one student:W/ crowd of 500 @RealBenCarson just called out to 5th grade class: who's dumbest kid in class? At least half dozen kids point to 1 student.  Timothy Meinch (@timeinch) January 7, 2016If you re a parent and that didn t absolutely infuriate you, you should have your idiot filter cleaned. In what universe is it OK to EVER degrade a child to make a political statement? The student said he wasn t upset by being singled out, which may make Carson feel better, but certainly not the kid s parents.Carson s numbers have been dwindling and it appears his campaign is nearing the end. Hopefully he drops his aspirations to de-throne George W Bush as the least qualified buffoon ever to occupy the Oval Office sooner than later before he causes any more damage.Featured image by Gage Skidmore",News,"January 7, 2016"
8969, You Have To See Ammon Bundy’s Ridiculous Press Conference In Oregon (VIDEO),"Ammon Bundy, the son of the secessionist rancher Cliven Bundy, held a rambling, incoherent press conference on Monday at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon. The 40-year-old Bundy rancher defended convicted ranchers Dwight and Steven Hammond, even though the Hammonds don t really want help from the Bundy brothers. Hammond attorney W. Alan Schroeder told reporters,  Neither Ammon Bundy nor anyone within his group/organization speak for the Hammond family. But off he went anyway: We have allowed our federal government to step outside the bounds of the Constitution. They have come down upon on the people,  Ammon Bundy said in a press conference Monday.  They are coming down into the state and taking over the land and the resources, putting the people into duress. Among other things, Bundy announced the name of his group: Citizens For Constitutional Freedom.Bundy also presented a  redress of grievances,  read by another member of his group. The grievances were endorsed by other militia groups, such as (we re not making these up) Oregon Bearded Bastards, the Oregon Oath Keepers and the Central Oregon Constitutional Guard. I know, I know. The  Oregon Bearded Bastards  sound like they could totally annihilate the U.S. government and its pawns in the military. Look out, Marines! (Meanwhile, the Central Oregon Constitutional Guard smartly used the word  guard  instead of the original suggestion,  Central Oregon Constitutional Klan  or  C.O.C.K.  The acronym would ve been problematic. #Joke)The big takeaway from the press conference is this: the Bundys are clearly milking their 15 minutes by piggybacking their ridiculous agenda onto the Hammond agenda. Together, it s one big dumb agenda, fueled by fantasies of 1776   as if there s any realistic chance that an armed conflict with the government wouldn t end with these posers in body bags.Featured image via video screen grab.",News,"January 4, 2016"

4600, WATCH: Trump From 2011 Was DEFINITELY Sure Obama Wasn’t Born In The USA,"With absolutely no shame or apology, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump finally admitted to the American public that President Obama was, in fact, born in the United States of America despite his repeated efforts to prove otherwise. It s now not as politically convenient for Trump to still push this issue considering he now has to try to win over the opposing side of the topic.Trump said: President Obama was born in the United States. Period. Now, we want to get back to making America strong and great again. Profound, really. And absolutely pathetic.Here s the thing, though, Trump is full of absolute horseshi*t because he was the Birther-in-Chief back half a decade ago, even going so far as to claim credit for the fact that Obama released his birth certificate. And even after that, Trump still had his many doubts over its authenticity.There s even video of him from 2011 stating how much he believes this is a very valid issue that needs to be looked into. He even went so far as to say calling those who wanted to see the birth certificate  birthers  was  derogatory  because they re actually  on to something. And ever the political opportunist, he said: People love this issue   especially in the Republican Party. So, when you hear Trump say that  President Obama was born in the United States. Period,  remember what he really thought and likely still thinks. You can also tell he s doing it for pandering purposes because he ended his announcement with his damn campaign slogan.Those who haven t caught on to how absolutely smarmy Trump is, need to wake up and wake up fast.Kyle Griffin of MSNBC s Last Word posted the video on Twitter:Trump on birtherism in 2011: ""People love this issue   especially in the Republican Party."" https://t.co/6I6WKsC4DI pic.twitter.com/6eza8loaoN  Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) September 16, 2016Featured image via video screen capture",News,"September 16, 2016"

He banned all non-essential travel to Mississippi after the state passed a religious liberty bill that he called a  hateful injustice against the LGBT community.  Can you believe this guy?  The bill, known as House Bill 1523 or the  Protecting Freedom of Conscience from Government Discrimination Act,  was signed into law by Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant (R) Tuesday and will go into effect July 1.The legislation guards against the discrimination of individuals, religious organizations and certain businesses who have  sincerely held religious beliefs or moral convictions  that marriage  should be recognized as the union of one man and one woman. Under the law, religious leaders can decline to  solemnize any marriage  or provide wedding-related services based on religious or moral objections. In addition, Mississippians can decided  whether or not to hire, terminate or discipline an individual whose conduct or religious beliefs are inconsistent  with their own ideals.After the passage of the new law, Cuomo issued an order Tuesday that  requires all New York State agencies, departments, boards and commissions to immediately review all requests for state funded or state sponsored travel  to Mississippi.Last month, Cuomo did the same thing for travel to North Carolina.Read more: The Blaze ",politics,"Apr 7, 2016"
8493, Bristol Palin Wants Black Actors To Ignore Oscars’ Racism — ‘Not Everyone Gets A Trophy’,"Bristol Palin is no smarter than her mother, half-term governor of Alaska, Sarah. However, she sure does think she knows a lot about a lot of things. As if being an abstinence activist who has had two out-of-wedlock children weren t enough, Bristol has also decided that she is some kind of racism expert.Ever since black actors and their allies have decided to boycott the Oscars because, for the second year in a row, they have no black stars nominated for their prestigious awards, white folks all over the place have been telling Black America at large that there s no problem here, when we all know damn well there is. Now, Bristol Palin has added her voice to the mix.She said that she agrees with Fox contributor Stacey Dash, who wants to ride the world of pesky, racist institutions such as BET and Black History Month. This is bad enough coming from the Clueless star, who is black herself. To refresh, Dash said the following: Either we want to have segregation or integration. If we don t want segregation then we need to get rid of channels like BET and the BET Awards and the [NAACP] Image Awards. Now, lily-white Bristol Palin goes and blogs about something that in no way concerns her. Taking to her own blog, Bristol wrote: I have to admit, I don t know who  Waka Flocka  is, or what he sings, but I agree with him on this! Though [Ice Cube] didn t mention Stacey by name, isn t it interesting how he echoed her sentiments exactly? We shouldn t segregate ourselves or limit Black History Month to one month a year. I wish things were really colorblind. I don t know how other people think about it, but I hope my son sees early on   that not everyone gets a trophy. And this is the problem with people like Stacey Dash and Bristol Palin. Ignoring problems like racism doesn t make them go away; in fact, it always them to fester and grow under cover of dark. Exposing these things is how we rid the world of them. These actors and their supporters are taking on a systemic problem.No, you privileged, clueless little girl, this isn t about trophies and segregation. This is about uncovering the truth and telling it like it is, in an effort to right wrongs that are centuries old and counting.Then again, I don t expect you to know anything about that.Featured image via video screen capture",News,"January 27, 2016"

7623, Anti-Vaxxer Parents Let Toddler Die Of Meningitis After Maple Syrup Fails To Cure Him,"A Canadian couple is facing charges after their plan to avoid  harmful  medicine in favor of maple syrup and other home remedies failed to cure their young son of his meningitis. The 19-month-old died after two weeks of rapidly worsening illness without medical attention.The couple, David and Collet Stephan, are Mormons who run a nutritional supplement company in the United States. They were charged with the death of their child and face up to five years in prison if convicted.Sadly, the death of this toddler didn t come from ignorance, but from the malicious anti-vaccination movement, which deliberately spreads false information about medical practices and advocates in favor of unproven  natural  cures that alternate between the effectiveness of a placebo and down-right harm. Tapes played for the court featured Collet Stephan telling officers that a nurse friend pleaded with the couple about their son s illness, telling them it was a life-threatening case of meningitis. Rather than heed the nurse s warnings, the couple opted for home-brew concoctions.In a bid to boost his immune system, the couple gave the boy who was lethargic and becoming stiff   various home remedies, such as water with maple syrup, juice with frozen berries and finally a mixture of apple cider vinegar, horse radish root, hot peppers, mashed onion, garlic and ginger root as his condition deteriorated.Court heard the couple on tape explaining to the police officer that they prefer naturopathic remedies because of their family s negative experiences with the medical system.Perhaps most disturbingly, the couple continues to maintain that they did nothing wrong. On social media and in comments to the court, the Stephans have shown nothing but contempt for the judicial process. In the aftermath of his son s death, David has accused the government of attempting to force families like his to vaccinate their children. The fact that the child died because the government didn t force him to vaccinate his children is a point that seems to have eluded him.As other cases have done in the past, the plight of the Stephans and the victimization of their children (yes, they have other   unvaccinated   children still living with them), reminds us that this is not just an intellectual exercise or an example of the government overstepping its role. The anti-vaxxer movement, and its supporters, are putting the lives of real children at risk when they opt for maple syrup remedies over scientifically-tested medical care. No child should have to die because of their parents bad decision-making. And the parents should be held accountable for those decisions as well.Featured image via CBC/Facebook ",News,"March 8, 2016"
19387,"OBAMA BRAGS About Hijacking 1.35 Million Acres In Utah, Nevada…Despite Opposition…Posts Wrong Picture Of Land","President Barack Obama designated two national monuments Wednesday at sites in Utah and Nevada that have become key flashpoints over use of public land in the U.S. West, marking the administration s latest move to protect environmentally sensitive areas in its final days.The Bears Ears National Monument in Utah will cover 1.35 million acres in the Four Corners region, the White House said. In a victory for Native American tribes and conservationists, the designation protects land that is considered sacred and is home to an estimated 100,000 archaeological sites, including ancient cliff dwellings.It s a blow for state Republican leaders and many rural residents who fear it will add another layer of unnecessary federal control and close the area to energy development and recreation, a common refrain in the battle over use of the American West s vast open spaces.In Nevada, a 300,000-acre Gold Butte National Monument outside Las Vegas would protect a scenic and ecologically fragile area near where rancher Cliven Bundy led in an armed standoff with government agents in 2014. It includes rock art, artifacts, rare fossils and recently discovered tracks. Today s actions will help protect this cultural legacy and will ensure that future generations are able to enjoy and appreciate these scenic and historic landscapes,  Obama said in a statement.His administration has rushed to safeguard vulnerable areas ahead of President-elect Donald Trump s inauguration. It has blocked new mining claims outside Yellowstone National Park and new oil drilling in the Arctic Ocean.Obama s creation and expansion of monuments covers more acreage than any other president.But Trump s upcoming presidency has tempered the excitement for tribal leaders and conservationists, with some worrying he could try to reverse or reduce some of Obama s expansive land protections.U.S. Rep. Rob Bishop of Utah, who opposes the Bears Ears Monument, has suggested presidents have the power to undo monuments, though it has not been done before.  FOX NewsBut instead of the picture actually reflecting the land hijacked to make the  national monument  he uses a pic of the wrong area, Arches National Park.As Jason Chaffetz noted, Obama didn t consult him or anyone else in Utah for their approval or their concerns about taking the land.The problem of the Federal government taking private and state land has exploded under Obama, and this is just the latest example.

17247,DEMOCRATS THREATEN KIDS EDUCATION: CHICAGO TEACHERS UNION DEMANDS RAISES AS Chicago Public Schools Run Out Of Money In One Week,"It s painful to watch the stupidity and irresponsibility of the Democrats who run the city of Chicago along with Chicago Teachers Union president, Karen Lewis, one of the most hard-core radical, leftist s in the business. It s T-minus one week for Chicago Public Schools.As schools let out for the summer, CPS administrators are scrambling to come up with a more than $600 million teacher pension payment due at the end of the month and the district has zero reserves, according to media reports.The problem is further compounded by a more than $1 billion school budget shortfall for the next fiscal year and an angry teachers union hell bent on securing another raise the district can t afford. With no plan, no money and no where to turn, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel seems to be focused solely on a state bailout as the solution. Springfield has to step up and help in this case, not only as it relates to just the pension payment, (but also) the educational opportunities of our children,  Emanuel said, according to the Chicago Tribune.  Because a payment will then begin to impact   the classroom. And CTU could soon partner with its mortal enemies at City Hall to lobby state lawmakers for more money. Right now, the district needs us,  CTU VP Jesse Sharkey told the news site.  The politics of (Chicago Mayor) Rahm Emanuel going to Springfield are a lot different than the politics of Rahm Emanuel and (CTU President) Karen Lewis going to Springfield. The dire financial situation comes amid a federal investigation into a $20 million no-bid contract to a previous employer of former CPS superintendent Barbara Byrd-Bennett, who resigned this month. It feels like a complete mess,  Better Government Association senior editor Sarah Karp told ABC 7.Karp doesn t think recently elected Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner, who ran on a platform of fiscal restraint and criticized union influence in Illinois, is receptive to calls for a bailout. He previously suggested that bankruptcy may be the best way out for CPS, ABC 7 reports. Now, Chicago Public Schools does not have somebody in the State House that is a Democrat or is seemingly sympathetic at all to what s going on here,  Karp said.Meanwhile, school ended for the summer on Friday, and principals around the city are left scratching their heads in planning for next school year. Normally you do your planning in the summer and you can t do too much planning without the actual dollar amount,  Coles Language Academy principal Jeff Dase told ABC 7.Dase said many Chicago principals are concerned that the budget turmoil, and looming possibility of layoffs and program cuts, could convince many of the city s teachers to seek jobs elsewhere.The Tribune reports the city council could authorize CPS to increase taxes on residents, or secure some sort of bailout, or negotiate concessions with CTU, but not even all three combined could put the budget back on track. And then there s another $228 million payment coming due for costs related to interest rate swaps on the district s debt.    (E)ven if CPS wins concession from the City Council, state lawmakers and CTU, the district won t be able to close its annual $1 billion budget gap, according to a May 22 report by Ernst & Young, which spent four weeks meeting with school finance officials and analyzing budget documents,  the Tribune reports. The report shows that even with a capital improvement tax, a separate, even-larger property tax increase, additional state aid, increased state funding of teacher pensions, concessions from the CTU and $150 million with of budget cuts, CPS would still face an annual $350 million shortfall. Next June s teacher pension payment is set to balloon to $700 million. Via: EAG News",Government News,"Jun 24, 2015"

4039, Trump’s Hollywood Walk Of Fame Star Bashed To Bits With Sledgehammer,"Donald Trump s Hollywood star on the Walk of Fame was utterly destroyed early this morning by a man wielding a sledgehammer and a pick ax.Trump s star has been the site of vandalism before. Earlier this year, a nazi swastika was spray painted on his star and at one point a tiny wall was built around his star. It has also become a popular potty spot for passing dogs and the occasional human. For this reason, the Hollywood Historic Trust even considered removing Trump s star from Hollywood Boulevard altogether.But things went to a new level on Wednesday morning. At approximately 5:45 A.M., a man disguised as a construction worker demolished Trump s star with a sledgehammer and a pick ax.James Otis has taken responsibility for the early morning destruction of Trump s Walk of Fame star. He told Deadline that he had originally planned to remove the star in one piece and take it to New York City to be auctioned off.Otis wanted to sell the star to raise funds for the 11 women who have come forward to accuse the GOP nominee of sexual assault. During a rally last week, Trump vowed that after the election he would sue all the women who have said he assaulted them and called them liars.Although, the LA hotspot is usually packed with tourists, at this particular time of day the site was nearly deserted except for a few bystanders. No police were present at the time of the star s desecration. A cruiser reportedly arrived around 6:15 A.M., but Otis was long gone by then.The Chamber of Commerce has refused to remove Trump s star, despite repeated requests to do so via petitions. At the moment, the tattered remains of Trump s Hollywood star is covered by a small tent. There is no word yet on how the Chamber plans to respond to this latest act of vandalism.Deadline has obtained exclusive video of the star being destroyed, which you can find here.Featured image via video screen capture",News,"October 26, 2016"

And he joked that he and his staff were too tired to run for a third term, even if he could.At another fundraiser, Obama pointed out that getting Democrats back in charge of Congress is very important.On Thursday night, Obama attended a large gathering at the Bel Air mansion of Disney Chairman Alan Horn and his environmentalist wife, Cindy. There, the president stressed the importance of  recognizing the enormous power of Congress and the difference between a Nancy Pelosi being Speaker of the House and a Paul Ryan being Speaker of the House. The President also highlighted the GOP blockade of Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland, even though Garland has received praise from across the political spectrum. And he pointed out that the blockade would be eroded with more Democratic votes in the Senate since,  What we ve seen out of the Republicans in the Senate is not simply a refusal to confirm him thus far, but a refusal to meet with him or to have a hearing, or to have a vote. Obama went on to point out that crazed statements from Donald Trump and Ted Cruz have also helped to expose some of the extremism that happens every day in the House and Senate from Republicans, saying,  People act as if these folks are outliers. But they re not. The President said widespread coverage of their speeches and statements could help to motivate voters.Featured image via Flickr",News,"April 8, 2016"
18899,NEW LOW: NYT’s And CBS Used FAKE NEWS To Smear Wounded Warrior Project…Triple Amputee Vet And Freedom Daily Expose Them,"Freedom Daily   The Wounded Warrior Project (WWP) has been helping injured veterans since its inception in 2003, 2 years after the deadly terror attacks that rocked the nation on 9-11. Since its inception, the organization became the #1 veterans charity in the world. This year, WWP surpassed the 100,000 mark in terms of veterans they provide assistance to. Work the Wounded Warrior Project does has seen billions of dollars go to help severely injured veterans, and that doesn t even include the charity s day to day operations.After being attacked by the New York Times and CBS News last year, Wounded Warrior Project has fallen on hard times, and many severely wounded veterans are no longer receiving assistance. But now the truth has come out. The reports by the Times and CBS that Wounded Warrior Project was misusing funds has been completely debunked. Not only were tens of thousands of wounded veterans harmed by the lies maliciously told about WWP, but two of the founding members were fired by the board of directors, and now they re speaking out.Freedom Daily spoke exclusively to Al Giordano, a Marine vet & co-founder and former Chief Operating Officer of WWP.In 2009, Steve Nardizzi, another co-founder, became CEO of WWP. Both he & Giordano have been credited with building the Wounded Warrior Project into a charity powerhouse for injured veterans. That s when MSM began running fake news about the organization.On Wednesday, January 27, 2016, the New York Times ran a story based on the testimonies of several employees of WWP who were disgruntled over their termination from the charity. The former employees who had been fired had created a private Facebook page with which to communicate with one another. There they plotted to take down Wounded Warrior Project, and the New York Times was more than eager to help.Here is a response that was published by the NYT s to their article:To the Editor:I read with disgust your slanted article on the Wounded Warrior Project. The saddest part is that it endeavors to hurt an organization that does so much to help our wounded soldiers.I have been involved with the Wounded Warrior Project for over 12 years. I have met over 1,000 soldiers and their caregivers whose lives have been positively affected by the organization. Many soldiers have told me they would have committed suicide were it not for the Wounded Warrior Project.Your article zoned in on some disgruntled former employees rather than the roughly 500 staff members who work tirelessly to honor and empower our wounded. You do not reflect the sentiments of the more than 80,000 wounded soldiers we have helped, focusing instead on a few malcontents. For fiscal year 2015, Wounded Warrior reported a 92.9 percent satisfaction rate with the organization s services.PETER HONERKAMPAmagansett, N.Y.Giordano steered us to Professor Doug White, an author, recognized expert on charities, and former Director of the Masters of Science in Fundraising Management program at Columbia University. Professor White became aware of the hit piece done by the New York Times and compiled a 79-page independent report on the matter.White pointed out in his independent report that the Facebook group included Len Stachitis, Executive Vice President of Strategic Giving of WWP. Stachitis was terminated for covering up the theft of donor dollars from his direct reports including Teresa Nichols, Manager of Major gifts, another member of the Facebook group.Dave Philipps, a reporter for the Times, had been contacted by the group of fired WWP employees in June of 2015. Giordano relayed to us that while some former employees spoke glowingly about what WWP had done for them personally, they lied about how the charity was being managed. They had a score to settle. And Philipps ate it up.Nothing good that Philipps was told about WWP made it into his final article for the New York Times.What did Philipps leave out of his hit piece? Employees told him that WWP saved their lives and even their marriages.  Dan Nevins, an Army vet who lost both of his legs in Iraq literally cried about what WWP had done for him. Philipps laughed about it.  WWP had awesome morale and the lowest employee turnover for any charity   half the industry standard.  WWP had been voted the best non-profit to work for 3 years in a row   Philipps said it was worst.  WWP set up a private health care network with $70 million over three years to 4 hospitals for injured veterans to receive free mental health counseling.  WWP set up a Trust Fund with $100 million to take care of veterans whose parents couldn t so they wouldn t have to have the government put them into nursing homes.  Al Giordano and Steve Nardizzi got rave reviews from the WWP Board of Directors for how they did their jobs  Every. Single. Year.  A third party company was even brought in to do the internal polling in order to avoid the possibility of employees feeling  pressured  to rate their bosses in a favorable light.None of these things made it into the New York Times  hit piece on the Wounded Warrior Project. Everything that was perceived to be negative about the charity, even the lies the disgruntled, fired employees told Philipps, made the cut, though. Imagine that.The New York Times cited a report from charity auditor  Charity Navigator  that WWP spent  lavishly  on executives & administration rather than on vets. It turns out, the reporting was completely bogus, and just recently, WWP was afforded a 4-star rating by Charity Navigator, it s top rating, for the fiscal year 2015. Of course, for the New York Times, the story is all that matters, regardless of who is hurt if the story is 100% BS.Professor White explained in his report how the inaccurate reporting came about. His conclusions are damning   for the Fake News New York Times that is. In his report, he states that:The disgusting thing about all of this? Despite being proven wrong, neither the New York Times nor CBS will publish a retraction of their false stories. The Wounded Warrior Project is on schedule to lose $300 million in donor funds since the fake news stories came out. This has devastated WWP and its ability to help more wounded veterans, according to Giordano. Millions of veterans have been affected.Even the uber-liberal Washington Post reported on WWP being cleared of any wrongdoing under Nardizzi & Giordano.Houston Chronicle   After reports they were  spending lavishly  on things like travel, dinners and team building exercises at posh resorts instead of the needs of combat veterans, the Wounded Warrior Project has been given a clean bill of fiscal health from the Better Business Bureau.The BBB s Wise Giving Alliance said this month that the Florida-based Wounded Warrior Project meets their 20 point standard of charity accountability. According to their report, the WWP gets a passing grade for proper finances, governance, effectiveness and funding raising. WWP provided details of expenses and expense areas to demonstrate there was no evidence of lavish spending,  according to the report which found  the organization s spending to be consistent with its programs and mission. One of the issues that drew critical attentionin 2016 was a so-called  All Hands  meeting for WWP s employees at a five-star hotel in Colorado Springs. The audit from the BBB determined that the event cost $1 million and not the $3 million that was reported in the media. That amounted to less than $440 per day for the five-day training for 415 staff members, including hotel, food, travel and conference cost,  according to the report.Fox News  Bill O Reilly covered the news.

5591, Sarah Palin Loses Her Sh*t And Rage Whines After Hillary Is Not Charged By The FBI,"After the FBI declined to charge Hillary Clinton of any wrongdoing in the email  scandal  conservatives have been frothing at the mouth about for years now, Sarah Palin threw an even bigger temper tantrum than Donald Trump did.In a long rant on her Facebook page, Palin literally called upon conservatives to  tear down this tyrannical system  because Hillary Clinton was not charged with committing any of the crimes conservatives imagined she committed. It s a farce that  no one is above the law  and my heart goes out to all who ve been unjustly accused and destroyed over much lesser crimes than Hillary s,  Palin wrote.  We MUST redouble efforts to restore the rule of law that had sustained the most exceptional nation on earth, with everyone doing their part After telling conservatives to brainwash their kids and annoy anyone who will listen about how Hillary somehow orchestrated the FBI s decision, Palin whined about all the  scandals  President Obama and Hillary Clinton have gotten away with and accused Congress of being complicit.Letting Hillary skate today is no surprise when the team she s on has celebrated its administrators pleading the fifth, over and over again, sending messages to America that they re all above the law. From the IRS s Lois Lerner to Hillary herself testifying in front of Congress, they ve all told Congress to kiss off, and Congress kissed off.Today s FBI forgiveness of tyrants  illegal acts illustrate purpose in why I insist Americans rise up and tear down this tyrannical system that is destroying America from within. Truly, you re either with us or you re against us.Palin concluded her rant with a message to Republicans who refuse to blindly support Donald Trump by referring to them as  traitors. Message to all the  Republican  elites throwing in for Hillary, boasting they ll stay home instead of vote because their particular weakened good ol  boy is not the GOP nominee (the R.A.T.s suffering chappedass because their power and purse are threatened by the grassroots movement to destroy their failed politics-as-usual), Hillary thanks you. She knows she can t win without you.And then she included a bunch of anti-Hillary memes that repeatedly refer to Clinton as a criminal or a crook as well as images that bring up other imaginary  scandals  Republicans wasted time and money investigating only to find zero evidence to support their claims.Here s the full post via Facebook.It must be truly exhausting using the few brain cells she has left whining all the time just because she and her conservative trailer park fans didn t get their way.But that s why she s known as America s village idiot.Featured image via Flickr",News,"July 6, 2016"

16224,WOW! NEW REPORT: IRS Didn’t Tell 1 Million Taxpayers That Illegals Stole Their Social Security Numbers!,"REMEMBER BECKY GERRITSON OF ALABAMA WHOSE TEA PARTY GROUP WAS TARGETED BY THE IRS? SHE GAVE AN IMPASSIONED SPEECH TO CONGRESS. It seems the IRS hasn t changed its tune!The IRS has discovered more than 1 million Americans whose Social Security numbers were stolen by illegal immigrants, but officials never bothered to tell the taxpayers themselves, the agency s inspector general said in a withering new report released Tuesday. Investigators first alerted the IRS to the problem five years ago, but it s still not fixed, the inspector general said, and a pilot program meant to test a solution was canceled   and fell woefully short anyway. As a result, most taxpayers don t learn that their identities have been stolen and their Social Security files may be screwed up. Taxpayers identified as victims of employment-related identity theft are not notified,  the inspector general said. The report alarmed lawmakers on Capitol Hill, who were shocked that the IRS had gone for so long without fixing the issue.  It is stunning that the IRS has chosen to aid and abet identity thieves for so long instead of protecting the innocent victims of the theft,  said Sen. Daniel Coats, Indiana Republican.Victims  numbers are stolen by illegal immigrants who need to give employers a valid Social Security number in order to get a job. Employers are prohibited from probing too deeply into numbers, even when they suspect fraud. But the IRS learns of the scam when the illegal immigrants file their taxes using a special Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) the agency doles out chiefly to illegal immigrants as a way of making sure they re paying taxes even if they re not supposed to be in the U.S. Between 2011 and 2015 the agency flagged nearly 1.1 million returns where someone appeared to have stolen a valid Social Security number, the inspector general said.Read more: WT",Government News,"Feb 22, 2017"

Does anyone remember then President Barack Obama denouncing this hateful rhetoric against innocent law enforcement officers?Shortly after these protests, 2 New York City cops were killed in cold blood by a black lives matter supporter. Donald Trump, who was not yet a candidate for president, spoke out on the culpability of Al Sharpton, who is a close friend of former President Barack Obama for the murders of these innocent cops:President Trump didn t make any secret of the fact that he was pro-police while he was running for office. He also didn t make any secret of the fact that he believed Al Sharpton was doing what he was doing to racially divide our nation.President Trump made a joke while speaking to law enforcement officers that was portrayed in the media as an endorsement of police brutality.Meanwhile, the heartbreaking picture of slain Indiana cop Lt. Aaron Allen walking his young son to the bus on the day he was murdered by one of the  victims in a car crash he was responding to, has appeared on several social media sited.

Like, don t hit their head and they ve just killed somebody, don t hit their head. I said,  You can take the hand away, OK.

Trump praises police violence to audience of laughing cops,  left-wing ThinkProgress reported. Trump endorsed police brutality in a speech to law enforcement while officers laughed and cheered,  claimed Huffington Post editor Emma Gray.  In a country that already has a pretty pervasive problem with police brutality, Trump endorses their behavior,  wrote HuffPo editor Phillip Lewis. Trump just called for cops to rough up suspects more in front of a crowd of cops, they cheered,  claimed Daily Beast writer Colin Jones. President Trump is openly and explicitly calling for, to wild applause just moments ago, cops to commit more police brutality,  claimed Daily Beast writer Asawin Suebsaeng.

President Trump spent his Friday afternoon publicly praising police brutality,  claimed left-wing news outlet NowThis.Conservative commentator Ben Shapiro was quick to push back against claims that Trump was endorsing police brutality. This is all exaggeration. Is it appropriate for Trump to encourage police not to be  too nice  to suspects? Not really. But it s not police brutality to refrain from putting your hand on the head of a suspect to prevent them from bumping it on a car door. It s police brutality if you slam their head into the car door,  Shapiro wrote. ",left-news,"Jul 29, 2017"
4627," Surprise, Surprise: Trump Lied About What Happened When He Visited A Black Church In Flint","Donald Trump visited Flint, Michigan on Wednesday. Of course, that city is the place where is a crisis regarding having unusable water due to dangerously high lead levels and pipes that need to be replaced. While there, Trump toured a water plant and visited a Black church, where he pretended to care about the community, which is mostly poor and black, and suffering badly due to the water crisis.This was a bad idea in the first place, as the Mayor of Flint, Michigan, Democrat Karen Weaver, had already told Trump and his campaign that her city s very real issues were not to be used as some kind showboating photo-op. However, as per usual, Trump did what he wanted anyway, and when it didn t go well, he did what he usually does in such instances: LIED.Thursday morning, Trump went on Fox and Friends and criticized the pastor of Bethel United Methodist Church, Faith Green-Timmons. We ve all seen the viral video in which Pastor Green-Timmons shut Trump down when he attempted to use her church as a platform to attack Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, and in response, Trump lashed out at her on Fox News, calling her, quote, a  nervous mess.  Trump them went on say that the audience wanted him to keep speaking, but luckily there was an NPR reporter in the audience at the time, so those of us who weren t there can get the real story about what went down. From NPR: The audience was saying let him speak, let him speak,  Trump told Fox and Friends.That isn t true. In fact, several audience members began to heckle Trump, asking pointed questions about whether he racially discriminated against black tenants as a landlord.And that s when Green-Timmons   who Trump said Thursday had planned to ambush him   stepped in to defend Trump, saying the Republican nominee was  a guest of my church, and you will respect him. Thank you. Thank you, pastor,  Trump responded.The pointed questions for Trump continued as Trump wrapped up his remarks, though   and that s the moment when the press traveling with Trump was hastily escorted out of the room.Well, there you have it, folks. The people in the traditionally Black church saw right through Trump s attempt to pander and pretend that he actually cares about their well being, when, in fact we all have witnessed Trump s racism on full display throughout this travesty of a campaign. These people weren t having it, though, and they let Trump know exactly what they think of him.If it weren t for this reporting, we d have a very different account of what went down in that church on Wednesday, which is just one more reason not to trust a word that comes out of Donald Trump s mouth.Featured image via video screen capture from Twitter",News,"September 15, 2016"

8897, Maine’s Tea Party Governor Just Went On A Racist Rant So Offensive It Could Get Him Impeached,"Worst governor in the United States Paul LePage (R-Of Course) has said and done some truly reprehensible things during his time in office, but the latest bit of toxic sludge spewed from his mouth might finally be his downfall.On Wednesday night, during a town hall meeting, Maine s governor went so deeply racist that even members of his own party acknowledged it was  one of the most offensive statements  ever to come out of LePage s mouth   and that s saying something.While discussing Maine s drug problem, LePage floated the idea that it was out of state black people who were getting (white) Mainers hooked on heroin. It got worse from there. These are guys with the name D-Money, Smoothie, Shifty   these types of guys   they come from Connecticut and New York, they come up here, they sell their heroin, they go back home,  LePage told a large crowd.  Incidentally, half the time they impregnate a young, white girl before they leave, which is a real sad thing because then we have another issue we have to deal with down the road. D-Money, Smoothie, Shifty In a shameless attempt to spin it as not overtly racist, LePage s long-suffering communication director, Peter Steele, said that this wasn t about race. He then gave the following word salad defense. The governor is not making comments about race. Race is irrelevant,  Steele said.  What is relevant is the cost to state taxpayers for welfare and the emotional costs for these kids who are born as a result of involvement with drug traffickers. His heart goes out to these kids because he had a difficult childhood, too. We need to stop the drug traffickers from coming into our state. There are, might I say, just a few questions left unanswered here. Why did he use names like  D-Money  to refer to the  types of guys  who come into the state from Connecticut and New York? Doesn t that sound a lot like the kind of  gangsta  name a white conservative from Maine might come up with if they were brainstorming the backstory of a black drug dealer? Why did he specifically mention  young, white girls  when describing the kind of girls D-Money  likes to  impregnate?  Does he have any proof that  half the time  out of state drug dealers of any race impregnate Maine s young women?But the biggest question is Does he really think the entire state of Maine is too stupid to notice this for what it is? An ugly racist rant that is meant to stoke old racial fears of black men stealing white women?Democrats have long complained about LePage, but even Republicans are finding it increasingly hard to ignore his egregious behavior. Some have even created a website called  Get Right Maine,  which is an attempt to get LePage booted out of office and give the Republican Party a chance to save their image from the damage LePage has done.For LePage, his racist rant couldn t come at a more vulnerable time politically. Just days before he decided to introduce his imaginary black stereotype D-Money to voters, Maine s state lawmakers were discussing whether they should kick LePage from office or just censure him.House Majority Leader Jeff McCabe, D-Skowhegan, said LePage created this situation with his own actions. We join other Mainers around the state and share their anger and frustration,  said McCabe.  Democrats are focused on the most pressing issues before us. We are committed to addressing the drug crisis, growing access to broadband as well as helping our struggling mills.   The governor has isolated himself and we are not playing his games. He just handed his haters   which is, roughly, just about everyone he works with   a ton of ammunition. Ever his own worst enemy, LePage countered by throwing a massive tantrum, accusing his own party of conspiring against him and vowed to never work with Democrats again.The sooner LePage gets booted from office, the better.Feature image via Flickr",News,"January 7, 2016"

7970, Fellow Officer Says Cops Were NOT In Danger When They Shot Suicidal Vet (VIDEO),"This week, four Fresno County, California police officers appeared in federal court over allegations of civil rights violations, including excessive force and  callous disregard for human rights. The case was brought by Esperanza Booke, sister of the late Charles Salinas.Salinas, a 46-year-old veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps, called 911 on June 15, 2012. During the call he stated that he was suicidal and wanted to die.Salinas was later gunned down by three officers who were dispatched to the scene.Sanger police Sgt. Jason Boust and officers Preston Little and Angela Yambupah all opened fire on Salinas. He was struck at least 11 times by bullets sprayed from the officer s semi-automatic weapons.According to the federal suit, after killing Salinas, the officers were allowed to meet in a room at police headquarters for at least four hours, before they were ever interviewed by police investigators.The family s attorney claims that the officers used this time to plan how they would cover up their actions.The cops claim that they opened fire on the unarmed veteran after he made a series of sudden movements, which led them to believe that he was reaching for a weapon.What the cops did not know at the time, however, is that the shooting was captured on cellphone video, by a bystander.While the video has not been made public, it reportedly does not support the officer s testimony. Instead it shows that there was no lunging or jumping at the officers. What s more, on February 17, Fresno County sheriff Sgt. Joshua McCahill, testified that his fellow officers were NOT in danger when they opened fire on the suicidal veteran.According to McCahill, he was speaking with Salinas, who was sitting unarmed in a flower garden, when the other officers arrived on the scene. He testified that he did not believe his life was in danger.McCahill was the only officer on the scene who did not fire a weapon during the encounter.He testified that just before the other cops opened fire on Salinas, he called out to them to  bag  him, a term used to describe firing on a suspect with a non-lethal shotgun.Instead, the three officers turned their AR-15 rifles on Salinas. According to witnesses, the officers continued to shoot, even after the marine veteran had fallen to the ground.When asked why he did not shoot Salinas, McCahill said  because it was a non-lethal situation. According to Salinas family, he was suffering from PTSD.During the call to 911, Charles Salinas told the dispatch operator that he had no desire to hurt anyone other than himself. Let the record show that I would not even scratch a law enforcement officer,  Salinas told the dispatch operator.When conveying the nature of the situation to police, the 911 operator stated  He says he won t hurt you, but he wants to do a suicide by cop. Listen to the 911 tape below, courtesy of The Fresno Bee.This was an opportunity for law enforcement officers to do something good. There was plenty of room for these cops to use non-lethal force. Instead, they chose to end the life of Charles Salinas, a military veteran suffering from PTSD and depression.Reasonable force is defined as a level of force which would be used by  any reasonable law enforcement officer in the same situation. In this situation there was only one reasonable law enforcement officer on the other scene. That officer did not fire his weapon.

3490, WATCH: White Nationalist Gets Punched On Live Television For Incredibly Racist Remarks,"During a debate on French television show Niveau Z ro (Zero Level), right-wing nationalist Daniel Conversano spewed so much hate that essayist Alain Soral couldn t hold back anymore. They re not French,  Conversano said about Arab immigrants. He thinks Muslims should be killed and wiped out of the country by any means necessary, even if it means committing war crimes.Conversano is also anti-Semitic, which means he wants to treat Jews like the Nazis treated them.Soral took issue with Conversano s open hostility toward Muslims, saying,  They re not white, you mean,  he replied.  By what right do you dare to say that? And then things escalated.CONVERSANO:  Because it s the truth and everyone realizes it. SORAL:  Who is  everyone,  you little sh*t? Conversano responded by defining  everyone  as the 30 percent of people who support the National Front Party in the polls because they have  had it up to their a**holes in Arabs. At this point, Soral couldn t stand listening to Conversano s racist bullshit anymore and proceeded to whoop his ass.Here s the video via YouTube. The fight is at the 9:30 mark:Over 70 years ago, Americans joined nations around the world to fight and defeat regimes that preached racial purity and hate against certain ethnic groups. White nationalists in Germany took control of the nation from within via elections and the people paid the price for it. Millions of people around the globe paid the price for it with their very lives. Democracy and humanity were directly threatened with annihilation because people like Daniel Conversano in France and Donald Trump here in America are allowed to peddle their hatred and bigotry as mainstream ideas. They play on people s fears and emotions to turn them against people. And when enough people hand them power, we end up with brutal dictatorships that commit human rights violations and even genocide.A right-wing movement is currently rising to power across Europe like a plague and even America is going to be controlled by white nationalists for the next four years. For some reason, millions of people in Europe and America have forgotten about what white nationalists have done in the not-so-distant past. Jews were the ones being persecuted during World War II. Muslims are the ones being persecuted now. And fascism is once again poised to destroy democracy. The only question is who is going to stand up and fight against it if the governments and military forces of the free world are dominated by evil?While we may not necessarily agree with what Soral did, at least he had the courage to fight a white nationalist in defense of human rights. After all, white nationalists have been committing hate crimes and killing people for decades.Featured image via screenshot",News,"December 9, 2016"

Ironically, they also are the first to freak-out over any type of artistic expression that they think puts the President in an unflattering light. A disgusting New York City play depicting the president brutally assassinated,  is how Fox and Friends began a news segment about an NYC Shakespeare in the Park play they found to be offensive. Fox apparently succeeded at stoking conservative outrage because even Donald Trump Jr. seems to have his panties in a bunch over the play.I wonder how much of this ""art"" is funded by taxpayers? Serious question, when does ""art"" become political speech & does that change things? https://t.co/JfOmLLBJCn  Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) June 11, 2017So what is this outrageous performance? A play called The Tragedy of Julius Caesar, which was written by William Shakespeare all the way back in 1599   way before The Donald got his greasy paws on the White House.Most people are familiar with Julius Caesar from high school English class. The plot highlights the agony of Brutus, Caesar s pal who ends up conspiring to murder him. This particular version seems to be confusing Fox and Friends because of its anachronistic interpretation   the players are dressed in the clothes of today.According to Fox, they are sure this is a depiction of a Trump assassination because the actor looks very similar to the tall, blond businessman elected president in 2016. It s definitely a unique interpretation of the play, but modern updates of Shakespearean plays are very common   think 90 s Romeo and Juliet.On top of that, the play doesn t depict Caesar s assassination as a positive event nor the assassins as heroes.It s pretty snowflakey for Fox to be this pissed about a Shakespeare play.

23362,"Cruz & Kasich Quit: Trump Crushes Elite Establishment, #DropOutHillary Now Trending","21st Century Wire says The field is now clear for Trump to become the GOP presidential nominee.Watch a video of this report here:Ted Cruz and John Kasich have both now bowed out of the presidential race, leaving Donald Trump as the last Republican candidate standing.The two failing candidates made their decision after Trump swept to victory in Indiana last night.Dr. Inderjeet Parmar, Head of the Department of International Politics at City University London, says that,  it has exposed a deeply divided Republican party whose leadership has lost all credibility and whose conservative philosophy, which it has held dear since 1980, is in tatters. It is, indeed, the elite leadership of both political parties that appears to have provoked this realignment in US politics towards outsiders and those not embroiled in what many see as a corrupt and broken system.Bernie Sanders, the Democratic outsider, also shocked the world with a victory over Hillary Clinton last night.Just two weeks ago Cruz and Kasich were publicising that they had made a deal to stop Trump, yet even their combined efforts were useless.Yesterday, a Rasmussen poll emerged showing that Donald Trump can indeed beat Hillary Clinton at the general election, and that scenario is looking ever more likely with the political establishment in such dramatic retreat.It is possible that Bernie voters will not support Hillary in the general election, and in many ways their anti-establishment position gels much better with the politics of Trump than it does with Wall Street insider Clinton.Immediately after Kasich s announcement today, #DropOutHillary began trending on Twitter. At the time of writing it is the number two trending hashtag in the US with 102,000 tweets.With such an immediate response taking aim at another establishment figure, the chances of Trump, or perhaps even Sanders, taking the presidency seem higher than ever.GET THE FULL STORY ON THE ELECTION: 21st Century Wire 2016 Election Files",Middle-east,"May 4, 2016"
21920,YEAR IN REVIEW: 2017 Top Ten Conspiracies,"Patrick Henningsen and Shawn Helton 21st Century WireOnce again, we ve arrived at our New Years Eve wrap-up of some of the most compelling and conspiratorial stories of the year. Like in years past, 2017 presented a polarizing political landscape, further exposing the current establishment paradigm. Unlike the establishment gatekeepers, when we use the word  conspiracy  here, we are talking about a real crime scene. Whether it was the ousting of thousands of western-backed terrorists in Iraq and Syria or a string of  known wolf  attacks amplified by made-to-order media agitprop, or the heavily manufactured Russia-gate narrative relentlessly pushed by mainstream outlets and Deep State actors    it seemed there was no shortage of topsy-turvy stagecraft designed to mislead and confuse the masses at a time when the real world is undergoing some significant geopolitical realignments.As was the case in 2016, there were many high-profile incidents and individual stories which didn t make our annual compendium (but they are worth mentioning)   like the  red herring  laced New Year s Eve mass shooting at Turkey s Reina nightclub that kicked off 2017 in classic Daily Shooter fashion, along with other dubious events like Fort Lauderdale s FBI-known shooter and subsequent CNN media circus. On the political front, it was a banner year for astroturfing starting with  The Resistance  which spent most of the first 3 months of the year demanding Trump s impeachment before he had served 100 days in office. As part of these efforts, we saw Hollywood and the Democratic Party s choreographed women s march backed by political agitator and perennial globalist George Soros, as well as MoveOn.org and other Soros-backed protests which followed Trump s highly controversial immigration ban, as contentious resignations by key members of the Trump White House loomed large. The stage was then set for Antifa s US  riot tour  which culminated the Charlottesville riots in Virginia followed by a series of  social justice  protests over Confederate statues, followed by more extremist left-wing  antifascists  foot-soldiers like  black bloc  throwing molotov cocktails and smashing buildings for kicks. And that only scratches the surface of what transpired in 2017.Other notable stories throughout the year included the Trump administration s decision to announce the creation of an  Arab NATO headquartered in Saudi Arabia, the world s second-largest state sponsored of terror (US being the largest).  That geopolitical gambit then teed up the Trump White House to announce that the US Embassy in Tel Aviv would begin proceedings to move to Jerusalem, a shift which some critics believe is further evidence of an ultra-Zionist agenda encroaching on Israeli-occupied Palestine and the West Bank. On the Asia front, questions emerged over what North Korea actually has in terms of ICBM missiles and a nuclear deterrent, while in the Middle East speculation raged about Saudi Arabia s historic palace purge and sabre rattling in the region. The year then saw the exposure of a giant US-NATO-Saudi weapons trafficking operation using diplomatic flight in order to arm terrorists in Syria and Iraq. 2017 also saw the mainstream media continue to market the media construct known as Bana of Aleppo, expecting the public to believe that an 8 year old girl who could not speak English was running a Twitter account from war-torn (and terrorist-occupied) East Aleppo from the autumn of 2016   all the while waxing poetic about the evil Assad, and the evil Russians and calling for US military intervention in Syria  pure propaganda and a clear case of child exploitation. Interestingly, this outlandish Bana propaganda myth campaign has been shamelessly promoted by the multimillionaire Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling. 2017 also saw a wave of intelligence releases, set in motion by the CIA, who released more than 12 million documents pertaining to covert war programs, psychic research and the Cold War era, further outlining the symbiotic relationship between the agency and American media. This was followed by Wikileaks exposing much of the CIA s cyber hacking capabilities in their  Vault 7  and later in their  Vault 8  publications. Towards the end of the year, a new twist in the downing of MH17 revealed an apparent Netherlands cover-up, as another bizarre Daily Shooter event, the Texas Church shooting, would later disappear from headlines. Around the same time frame, new questions also emerged in the Sandy Hook saga concerning prior knowledge of the FBI, as New York was then stricken by a known wolf truck attacker. In December it was finally announced that after being held in prison for two years without trial, the Fed s Bundy Ranch Standoff case was declared a mistrial. However, most of the year s controversial stories were quickly pushed to the back page, buried underneath an avalanche of ready-to-go Weinstein-inspired sex abuse scandals involving Hollywood s elite punctuated by obligatory hashtag campaigns like #MeToo, before snagging a number of high-profile news media personalities and some of Washington s most coveted swamp dwellers. As an onslaught of new accusations flooded the media, the sordid revelation of a Congressional slush fund used to payoff sexual harassment accusers made headlines. The whole situation conjured DC s Conspiracy of Silence regarding tales of sexual misconduct in days past.All in all, it was another year of  hyper-real  media propaganda, as some stories published by mainstream media led to a cascade of retractions and corrections, and in certain cases, provided an all to convenient mask for other politically charged news throughout much of 2017. Unlike the mainstream media  official  conspiracies (like Russiagate), these ones are actually real  10.  The JFK Files  Over the course of 2017, one of America s most compelling conspiracies was reignited following the release of thousands of intelligence files long-held by the CIA and FBI. In late October, the Trump administration called for the release of the remaining JFK files, citing the JFK Assassination Records Collection Act deadline placed into law in 1992. While the material released was reportedly a mix of new and old, some critics declared that the recently declassified files revealed even more startling evidence related to the assassination of the 35th President of the United States, John F. Kennedy. This prompted larger legacy media establishments to provide a murky retelling of the JFK saga.  Predictably, a week after the releases, one newer CIA memo stated that any links between the CIA and Lee Harvey Oswald, were  unfounded.  In essence, the JFK file releases appear to have been a way for the political powers that be to shut the door on a conspiracy that has an overwhelming amount of information suggesting CIA links not only to Oswald, but many of the characters surrounding the case. In reality though, as newfound interest in the JFK files was reawakened, it cast light on the over five decade old case, reopening the door to coup d tat claims concerning JFK and Cold War era  false flag  terror. In particular, terror created by Operation GLADIO, a CIA-NATO construct, which utilized covert armies to subvert the political interests of various nations through the implementation of a Cold-War era strategy of tension. The further one digs into America s seedy underworld of organized crime, intelligence operations, unlikely coincidences and secretive relationships concerning the mysterious plot to kill Kennedy, a highly intricate web of activity emerges that points to a compelling case beyond almost any other modern-day conspiracy.9. Grenfell Tower Fire & Cover-Up   It was Britain s biggest domestic disaster post WWII, and from the minute this story broke, reports of government and corporate corruption began to surface. This real-life Towering Inferno featured some of the most surreal revelations, including a corrupt government Qango known as TMO (Tenant Management Organisation) who had paid a contractor to install highly flammable petroleum-based  cladding  on the building, supposedly to meet  green sustainability goals  but also to cover-up what wealthy property developers deemed as an eye sore (social housing high rise building), part of London s continuous and rampant  gentrification  property bubble agenda. The controversy did not stop with the fire itself though, as residents and concerned members of the public began to question the abnormally low death count which was being trumpeted by the media and the government agencies. Meanwhile, thousands of residents from Grenfell Tower and the surrounding buildings continued to suffer and mourn the loss of loved ones and friends   leaving in indellible scar on the community   while the government s elite Common Purpose management class continued on with business as usual. Six months on,  the public is still wondering whether anyone will be arrested, or held to account for this unprecedented story of criminal negligence. In one of its most seminal episodes, the SUNDAY WIRE radio show, along with its affiliate the UK Column, drove the investigative agenda early on in this story, with the mainstream media later picking talking points covered by this independent media outlet.8. The Crisis in Yemen   Back in January 2015   while the world was focused on the war in Syria, 21WIRE first raised the alarm over Yemen after it noticed the insatiable war-time president Barack Obama, along with Deep State and Pentagon media outlet CNN began drifting out talking points about Yemen. It wasn t long after that, in March 2015, that Saudi Arabia   with the full military and political backing of the US and UK, began an undeclared war of aggression against Saudi s neighbor Yemen. Nearly three years on, with tens of thousands slaughtered by Saudi airstrikes dropping their newly purchased US and UK munitions (and even enjoying air refueling by the US military) and with the Saudi and US military blockade which is keeping much-needed humanitarian aid from entering the war-ravaged country leading to mass starvation and disease outbreaks like cholera on the peninsula   why isn t the international community calling out the illegal war against Yemen for what it is   genocide? In order to prop-up their fake narrative on Yemen, the US and UK mainstream media conglomerates and their state propaganda directors from intelligence agency information warfare units have concocted a new batch of official disinformation lies and myths used to muddy the waters of this important discussion and ultimately justify their slaughter and arms sales bonanza in Yemen. On balance, what the US, UK and Saudi Arabia have done to Yemen is by orders of magnitude worse than what Nazi Germany did to its neighbors in the initial phase of WWII. Nothing less than a new Nuremberg Trial will be suitable to help correct this act of international barbarism.7. London s GLADIO-style Attacks  On March 22nd, an apparent two-pronged terror attack stretched from London s Westminster Bridge to Parliament Square. In the days leading up to the London attacks, it was revealed that Met Police rehearsed a  terrifyingly realistic drill on the River Thames prior to yet another known wolf act of terror taking place. Adding to the drama, the London attacks occurred exactly one year after the Brussels airport bombings. In addition, the bizarre and unexpected event took place during a massive uptick of Western allied involvement in the Syrian conflict and in less than 24 hours, London authorities revealed that the British-born attacker named Khalid Masood, (after media outlets erroneously reported the wrong suspect) was already well-known to MI5 and had worked in Saudi Arabia sometime between 2005-2008. Shortly after the attack, it was revealed that eye-witnesses reported seeing multiple assailants at the crime scene, this was something that directly contradicted the official story. In fact, in those reports, it was suggested that at least two individuals participated in the large-scale attack in one of the most heavily surveilled parts of London. This aspect of the case was quickly buried by major media outlets, echoing other high-profile cases involving  known wolf  terrorists. In recent years, there s been a pattern of multiple suspects often witnessed or said to be involved in other terror-related events. This proved to be the case in the aftermath of the Nice, France truck attack, as well as the Brussels airport bombing in 2016. Rather incredibly or unbelievably, London s acting Police Commissioner Craig Mackey, just so happened to be at the scene to  witness  the Parliament Square attack on Pc Keith Palmer. All in all, the latest symbolically charged  ISIS-approved  attack on the verge of spring, appeared to be an effort to polarize the perception of Western viewers with yet another round of wartime propaganda, while also providing a media smoke screen for recent US military action in Syria. By early summer, just after the Manchester arena bombing, London once again became a target of a purported multi-pronged terror event right on the heels of the UK s hotly contested 2017 general election. Afterwards, a number of questions were raised following the London Bridge attacks, just as there were following the Parliament Square, Westminster Bridge attacks and the Manchester Arena attack. It s important to note the common thread between each suspicious event, and the recent UK attacks are no exception   there s now indisputable evidence linking MI5 and MI6 British security services to various  known wolves  prior to carrying out the terror crimes mentioned above. The precarious relationship between security and terror is an ongoing pattern seen after almost every major terror attack on Western soil. Throughout 2017, the London attacks seemed to increase racial and ethnic tensions in the West, while also pushing the public into accepting a more direct military intervention in Syria, and new police state measures and surveillance powers in the UK   prompting us to ask, who benefited the most from the London Attacks? We d say the answer to that question is pretty obvious now 6. Manchester s  Known Wolf  Arena Attack  Another day, another conspiratorial crime. In this case, the public was witness to yet another known wolf  terror attack allegedly carried out by an  ISIS-inspired  individual who, as with numerous other cases, was under the gaze of MI5. The man named in the Manchester bombing attack, Salman Abedi, was also tied to a terror group supported by NATO in Libya during the operation to oust Muammar el-Qaddafi in 2011. The Manchester arena attack proved to be more than just blowback from security operations gone awry, it provided further evidence of complicity on behalf of the West in the  War On Terror  era. While some researchers and analysts were a buzz with the numerological synchronicities associated with the Manchester attack, others noted some very real political circumstances and significant timelines surrounding this apparent mass-tragedy in Manchester. The event just happened to arrive on the heels of a monolithic arms deals with Saudi Arabia worth $110 billion dollars that will total $350 billion over the next 10 years, and only shortly after the Manchester attack, there were US-led coalition airstrikes supposedly targeting ISIS in both Syria and Iraq   that killed 121 civilians in the process. The strikes led to increased tension, placing external pressure on the Russian-led Astana Peace Agreement in Syria, while continuing to benefit the strategic movements of ISIS in Syria. The really damning link however, was exposed by one major UK Government eyesore after the Manchester attacks: the revelation that a community of  outlawed  Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG) terrorists were in fact living in close proximity to the Manchester attacker Abedi, and directly connected to Abedi himself. This was a deeply troubling development for a public unaware of the nearby danger, as British security services and officials allowed this  thriving  group of fighters to reside in the UK seemingly without consequence or disclosure of their previous activities   until the Manchester attack. So naturally, when it was revealed that Ramadan Abedi (the father of the purported Manchester suicide bomber) was also a member of the UK government-backed Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG) and was believed to have been a part of LIFG during the NATO-backed regime change operation in Libya in 2011   it only raised more questions concerning the attack. It s worth noting, Libya s militant governor of Tripoli, Abdel Hakim Belhadj, was also a part of the Mujahideen fighters closely linked to Bin Laden who became known as al-Qaeda. In fact, Belhadj returned to his home country [in 1995] as head of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, an underground paramilitary organisation dedicated to Gaddafi s downfall. Over the years, Belhadj was incarcerated and turned loose back into the field after being rendered by the CIA and British security services. As of 2015, despite the Manchester attack links to LIFG, the group is still on the US State Department s Delisted Foreign Terrorist Organizations. In the days after the attack, authorities released CCTV imagery apparently depicting the Manchester attacker Abedi, in what appeared to be a way to dramatize the bombing through emotionally charged imagery, as the media obscured other facts and connections observed in the aftermath of the attack itself. The Manchester attack was similar to other high-profile incidents used to distort public opinion in the wake of media styled mass-tragedies.5.  The Las Vegas Mass Shooting   October 1st marked the return of the Great American Mass Shooting   a real record-breaker, complete with a shocking mile-long crime scene that stretched from the Las Vegas Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino to the nearby Route 91 Festival, where thousands of concertgoers suddenly became a target. Although America had seen a host of smaller, less sensationalized mass shootings throughout the course of 2017, including the bizarre Fort Lauderdale Airport Shooting and the strange Programmed to Kill Texas Church shooting, the high-profile Las Vegas calamity resuscitated the trauma inducing imagery so prevalent in the post-9/11 War On Terror era. This made-for-TV event was designed for media shock and awe, like  the 9/11 of Mass Shootings.  Over the past several years, 21WIRE has chronicled many bizarre shootings and mass casualty incidents that have rippled across America and Europe. These events have become a new kind of ritualized  crimescape  moving well beyond  security  concerns, but now accompanied by a complete range of  socio-political mainstream media talking points including race, religion,  gun reform ,  social media concerns  and domestic extremism   while concurrently obscuring and obfuscating the forensic reality of the crimes themselves. We re told that this tragic shooting attack was carried out by a classic  lone gunman    one individual without a criminal past (or nay past, as far as we could tell)  but there proved to be much more to the story. Adding to this  hyper-real  incident, the main suspect in the Las Vegas tragedy was also revealed to be a multi-millionaire  players club  member, 64 year-old Stephen Paddock. With no motive and no criminal history, Las Vegas police were tasked with uncovering details of a crime overseen by billionaire bosses at MGM Resorts International and the FBI. As authorities failed to uncover a clear motive for the crime, police scanner audio, along with eye-witness testimony suggested that multiple shooters may have been at the scene, although this aspect was downplayed by mainstream media. This was quickly followed by several official  revisions  in the timeline of the shooting and even the crime scene itself, as evidenced by this disastrous press conference which failed to yield any new information in the case. The star-witness of the shooting, Mandalay Bay security guard Jesus Campos, also vanished and was declared  missing  right before a major media interview, only to resurface much later on the oddest of media venues,  The Ellen DeGeneres Show,  giving media gatekeepers the chance to run interference for DeGeneres s slot machine business partners at MGM. Along the way, bizarre media performances by Paddock s brother, Eric Paddock, only prompted more questions and deepened the mystery surrounding this surreal case. While the public waited for MGM to release CCTV footage of the alleged shooter Paddock, not one tape materialized, except for an older tape from 2011. Staged photos of the Mandalay Bay crime scene led to other forensic questions concerning the weaponry used, compounding other acoustic anomalies already noted. Other confusing elements of the case included the missing hard drive from Paddock s laptop, another brother s arrest, the wiring of $100,000 to his live-in girlfriend s (Marilou Danley) home country, the Philippines, Paddock s previous employment at the predecessor company of Lockheed Martin, a reported break-in at one of his homes after the shooting, the absurd insertion of an  ISIS-inspired  motive (which a number of dubious click-bait media outlets ran with), and later seeing a back drop of active shooter related drills and government activity, along with details suggesting Paddock may not have been alone and much more. In the search for answers in America s largest-ever mass shooting, months later, we still have yet to see any CCTV footage of the alleged killer or his whereabouts leading up to the tragedy, as he moved in and around Las Vegas. Imagine that: no CCTV footage. While some have attempted to make sense of the Las Vegas shooting tragedy, there are reports of a major push to revamp security in the hospitality industry through the use of gunfire detection systems, X-ray, body scanners and facial recognition in the wake of this confusing, if not partly manufactured event. The popular media concept of a lone wolf killer in today s world has reprogrammed the public mind in the very same way that the serial killer phenomenon did decades ago. This new fear-based saga has ushered in a string of improbable Hollywood-style scenarios, inducing a frozen apathy across the masses. Rather than looking deeply at crime scene forensics or pouring over piles of collected data, these Daily Shooter crimes hold the public psyche hostage  until the next unexplained mass tragedy. Until the next episode 4. Syria s Sarin Gas False Flag  In less than 24 hours after the highly dubious alleged chemical attack on April 4th (reported to be Sarin gas by Western media) in Khan Shaykhun in the Idlib province of Syria, wide-scale unsubstantiated condemnation laid blame at the doorstep of the Syrian government and Russia following the release of video footage that had yet to be forensically scrutinized. In fact, the mainstream media flooded the airwaves with a bevy of circumstantial and speculative evidence   a far cry from actual hard evidence. Leaders in Washington and Western media outlets once again set the stage for wider military intervention in Syria. Days after the release of a forensically unproven chemical attack out of Khan Shaykhun, US President Donald Trump ordered a military strike on the Syrian government s Shayrat Air Base in response to the alleged chemical attack in Idlib. Trump s missile strike won him instant praise from the Pentagon media oracle CNN, as well as giddy celebrations by war-mongering neocons in the US. Perhaps the most telling aspect of  Syria s most recent mass casualty terror tragedy, was the suspicious involvement of the US-UK-NATO-Gulf state backed NGO known as the White Helmets  a group who once again was witnessed in wartime imagery that was not only full of anomalies but a production designed to evoke an emotional response rather than one based in rationality. Since their inception in late 2013, the White Helmets have largely conducted their so-called rescue operations in rebel-terrorist held areas in Syria, while producing an unprecedented amount of western-oriented war propaganda for nations deeply invested in arming and backing rebel-terrorists vying for regime change in Syria. Nearly two weeks after the alleged sarin gas attack, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Professor Theodore Postol directly disputed claims concerning the official US report regarding the alleged chemical weapons attack out of Khan Shaykhun in the  rebel-held  terrorist-occupied Idlib province of Syria. Postol s initial analysis, along with its addendum, appeared to echo what MIT research affiliate and former US Congressional staffer Subrata Ghoshroy observed in the aftermath of the Syrian chemical incident in East Ghouta, Damascus in 2013. In addition, other award-winning American journalists like Seymour Hersh and Gareth Porter also exposed the  sarin attack  narrative as a fabrication promulgated by a corrupt OPCW   but their reports were muted by mainstream gatekeepers. Both apparent attacks in Damascus and Idlib, were claimed through the presentation of dubious video imagery and suspicious photographs as a main source of evidence. Despite the absence of any real forensic investigation, the western media proclaimed  certainty  over images and videos largely supplied by the dubious  NGO  known as the  White Helmets.  It would later be revealed that on April 4th, the Syrian Air Force had also struck a warehouse in Idlib where chemical weapons were said to have been produced and stockpiled by US-backed militants. What was most disturbing, was that many in US-UK leadership seemed desperate for the public to buy into any WMD claims without concrete proof and in the process, they deliberately pushed heavily propagandized imagery presented on social media as proof of the as yet forensically unproven sarin gas attack. In essence, the whole event became a wag the dog moment ensnaring not only the White House, but many leaders in the UK as well.3. White Helmets Fraud   The White Helmets. Who are they, who created them, who funds them, and which master do they serve in Syria? In the US and in Europe, these fundamental questions routinely go unanswered by the western mainstream media organizations and government officials. Since first appearing on the western media scene in late 2013, the UK and US government-funded pseudo  NGO  known as the White Helmets has achieved cult-like status as their pictures adorn the front pages of newspapers and CNN breaking news segments about Syria. For the last 4 years, their principle function has been to produce a steady stream of  anti-Assad regime  and anti-Russian propaganda tailored for western audiences. Since 2015, 21WIRE led the way in asking these important questions, and in 2017 the overwhelming pressure of mounting evidence of the White Helmet fraud eventually led to various shoddy academics in the US and in the UK mainstream media outlets attacking 21WIRE and its writers for challenging the official White Helmets narrative   and for exposign how the UK government has been channeling hundreds of millions of pounds into terrorist-occupied areas of Syria under the thin guise building  civil society  (US and UK trojan horse) organizations in Syria. Establishment attacks included one mainstream media outlet promoting the White Helmets, The Guardian newspaper in the UK. According to The Guardian anyone who dared to question their official government-sanctioned narrative were  conspiracy theorists  and somehow part of a secret  Russian-backed propaganda campaign.  Despite mountains of evidence including various fake rescue videos, colluding in acts of murder and extreme violence and evidence which clearly depicts the dodgy  search and rescue  groups  members as dual members in armed al Qaeda terrorist affiliates operating in  rebel-held  opposition areas of Syria   western mainstream media are still determined to play dumb on this issue, which only goes to prove just how ignorant mainstream gatekeepers are as to the realities on the ground in Syria, or worse   how controlled are mainstream editors  desks by the western intelligence apparatus. Either way, Toto has already drawn the Wizard s curtain all the way back   and it s only a question of time before western media apologists and clueless politicians retreat into full  no comment  mode on this issue.2. The Russia-Gate PsyOp   It s been 18 months since the Democratic Party and the US mainstream media launched its  Russia-gate  narrative, claiming that Moscow had hacked the DNC, John Podesta and somehow influenced the result of the US 2016 Presidential Election. 18 months later, there s still no evidence to substantiate this mainstream conspiracy theory   making Russiagate easily the biggest fake news story of the year. What s most telling about this  official  conspiracy theory (as it turns out, it s the mainstream that peddles the grandest conspiracy theories) is that its proponents have to resort to publishing repeated lies and wild exaggerations in order to maintain the pillars supporting their narrative. So desperate were the New York Times to tie Trump to Russia that it even claimed that  the Russians  where creating Facebook pages about puppies in order to  confuse and mislead  vulnerable American voters. New York Times also had to retract their central lie which claimed that 17 US Intelligence agencies had all agreed that the Russians meddled in the 2016 presidential election   but still we hear legions of mindless  journalists  and shaky politicians like Adam Schiff (who, not surprisingly is also promoting the White Helmets) repeating that same old canard. As part of Washington s new McCarthyite red scare reboot, the US government labeled Russian international media network RT, and RT America as  foreign agents    forcing the channel and its journalists to register with the US government under old outdated pre-WWII espionage legislation. Other fake claims by US media include  Kremlin bots  deployed on Facebook to mess with the fragile minds of potential voters on social media, and CNN s all-time classic: an  Exclusive!  no less   claiming that the Russians somehow infiltrated the computer game Pokemon Go in order to  sow confusion among Americans.  Honestly, we couldn t make it up if we tried. What s beyond ironic is that the same media who has been constantly crying  fake news!  as their prime talking point to explain how Trump beat Clinton   has been dutifully recycling their own fake news narrative for over a year now. This one will surely go down in history as the biggest political hoax of all-time   and all of the mainstream media outlets who helped promulgate this myth should also go down with it. Sadly, too many mentally-challenged lawmakers in the US, UK and Europe are actually basing their foreign policies of this mainstream fake news myth   which is all too convenient for an ever-inflating the US defense budget, NATO s breakneck expansion eastward, and also for Brussels  new roll-out of its EU Army  1.  Fake News 2.0    2017 was the year of fake news. Last year, we crowned Fake News 1.0 as our top conspiracy, but this past year has seen it ascend to an entirely new level. From the beginning, this faux crisis had a clear set of political objectives. The first was to provide a scapegoat for Hillary Clinton s catastrophic imploding presidential run, and secondly, to try and prop-up the establishment s official conspiracy theory that somehow the Russians were spreading  fake news  across social media and alternative media websites   in order to help Donald Trump win the election. On this front, many of us are indebted to Trump for branding CNN with the meme that keeps sticking, as the President hit CNN s bumbling White House correspondent Jim Acosta, with Trump pointing to Acosta and saying,  You are fake news!  live on national TV. If was a glorious moment for sure. Newspapers like the Washington Post performed a key role for the US Deep State by pushing-out fictional news features like the one claiming 200 of the leading alternative media websites were part of some Kremlin-orchestrated network of websites carrying out  active measures  (a defunct Cold War term) propaganda against the American people. The Post even presented a bogus anonymous construct, a website called  PropOrNot  in order to try and make their conspiracy theory look official. Around the same time, a radical progressive academic from Merrimack College in Massachusetts published a  fake news list    a database and virtual  blacklist  designed to defame and slander any independent media outlets who happened to veer from the party line and challenge the policies of Hillary Clinton and Obama. Dr. Zimdars heavily politicized  list  was promoted by  the LA Times which, like the fraudulent story published in The Post, claimed that hundreds of alternative media websites were producing  fake news  and  conspiracy  stories and therefore were unreliable as information sources. It wasn t long before the establishment began referencing these politicized lists, holding them up as  proof  of some crisis in what the liberal intelligensia proudly dubbed a  post-truth  world. Despite the establishment s insistence on pushing this faux crisis, an increasing number of smart news consumers came to realize that for at least the last century and half, the establishment s tightly-controlled information syndicate has been able to manufacture its own consensus reality through the use of their own  official  fake news. By channeling public opinion in this way, the mainstream press has helped facilitate a number of engineered outcomes   including war. Perhaps the most dangerous aspect of the fake news  circus, is that Silicon Valley monopolies like Google and Facebook have taken it upon themselves to manipulate their online platforms in such a way that they are choosing which websites and news sources will be  de-ranked  and effectively hidden from the view of most users, and, in the case of Facebook   censoring real information presented by independent, non mainstream journalists, but allowing political operatives to abuse their problematic  communitarian  information policing system to strike off  offensive  content. As a result a number of leading alternative commentators have been banned from Facebook for completely illegitimate reasons. Finally, we can reveal the  2.0  aspect of the establishment s  fake news  faux crisis   a false pretext to unleash a wide-ranging program of internet censorship   and it s already begun. Reasonable people should be under no illusions: Google Inc, Facebook and global monopolies like them it are the closest thing to a classic fascist-corporatist behemoth you will find in the world today. Both Google and Facebook are both actively colluding with big government and other mainstream media partners, and are guilty of  stealth censoring  through either their A.I. filtering algorithms, or through flagged websites on a database used to de-rank leading independent and anti-war sites like 21st Century Wire, Anti-War.com, Consortium News, Global Research and countless others. Furthermore, Facebook is now on record as admitting to colluding with both the US and Israeli governments to delete  undesirable  accounts. This is a corporation which is now actively and opening violating US laws, which is engaging in criminal activity by any other definition. These are not the only threats posed by these corporate fascists. The very same corporate digital barons have also been busy colluding with politicians in order to repeal Net Neutrality   as part of the elites  final end-run to marginalize and ultimately crush all independent and dissenting voices online who threaten the primacy of mainstream groupthink, and who could get broader traction among the population if the playing field was truly a level one. Not only is this illegal under antitrust laws, but it represents a brutal form of fascism. It s now clearer than ever that Silicon Valley executives and government bureaucrats cannot be trusted to manage the most important public utility of the new century   the information super highway.So if the mainstream press can no longer be trusted, then who can you trust for objectivity and accuracy? Again, we have to ask the question: who s watching the watchers?

6593, Chicago Police Caught On Camera Assaulting Black Female Pastor (VIDEO),"One night in 2013, Reverend Catherine Brown turned down the alley that leads to the driveway of her Chicago home, just as she had done many times before. Her two small children were in the back of her vehicle.As she came around the curve, Rev. Brown encountered a vehicle heading straight toward her on the narrow alleyway. Her first instinct was to slam on the horn, as she quickly brought her own car to a stop.Before Brown knew what was happening, Chicago police officer Michelle Morsi Murphy jumped from the other vehicle and immediately began hurling obscenities at the young mother.According to Brown, she was shocked by the officer s aggressive actions.  As she reached for driver s license, a second officer, Jose Lopez, got out of the vehicle and pointed a gun at her head.Not knowing what else to do, the terrified pastor called 911 asking for a supervisor to be sent to the location.According to CBS in Chicago, which obtained a copy of Brown s 911 call, the recordings  reveal she felt threatened and in danger. They also show that  She repeatedly asks for a lieutenant and police to come and help. CBS Chicago also reports that  her daughters  screams can be heard on the calls. Instead of waiting for a supervisor to arrive, Murphy and Lopez attempted to force the door of Brown s vehicle open.The terrified pastor put her car in reverse and backed out of the alley, hoping to reach an area where witnesses might see what was taking place.The two Chicago police officers pursued Brown s vehicle.Dashcam footage shows that, once she was out of the alley, Brown brought her own vehicle to a complete stop again.The cops plowed directly into Brown s car, showing a complete lack of concern for the two children in the backseat.At this point Brown got out of her car and began shouting for witnesses.Officer Lopez then pepper-sprayed the terrified woman directly in the face, also spraying her one-year-old baby in the process. Officer Murphy can be seen laughing.Murphy then jumped on top of a car which was parked on the street, next to Brown s vehicle, aiming her gun directly at the woman.Another officer appeared at this point.

15244,BREAKING UPDATE: [Video] ROOKIE COP IS TERMINATED AFTER FABRICATING STORY ABOUT BEING HIT BY GUNFIRE NEAR BOSTON,"A rookie police officer in Millis who said Wednesday that someone shot his cruiser before it crashed and burst into flames fabricated the story, police said.The officer, 24, said he was traveling on Forest Road when he saw a red or maroon pickup truck traveling in the opposite direction. He said when the two vehicles met, the driver opened fire on the police cruiser, police say. My cruiser s been shot at. I m at Forest Road. It s going to be a dark maroon pickup,  the officer radioed to dispatch at 2:17 p.m.The officer said he spun around, and in an attempt to avoid the gunfire and seek shelter, he slammed into a tree and the cruiser burst into flames. We have determined that the officer s story was fabricated. Specifically, that he fired shots at his own cruiser as a plan to concoct a story that he was fired upon,  Millis Police Sgt. William Dwyer said.  The evidence indicates the shots were not fired by a suspect, and there is no gunman at large in or around the town. A massive manhunt for the alleged gunman was launched. The neighborhood was immediately locked down while police units, including a SWAT team, K-9 officers and a Massachusetts State Police helicopter combed the area.Residents who were told to stay indoors or couldn t get home because of the lockdown said they were dumbfounded that the story may have been made up. With all these police officers actually getting hurt in this world, why he is doing that I don t know,  Nancy Haney said.Dwyer said the officer is new to the force and has not yet attended the police academy. He said the officer will be terminated, and his name will not be released until the investigation is complete. Via: WCBV TVHERE IS THE ORIGINAL STORY:A Massachusetts police cruiser crashed and caught fire after it was struck by gunfire Wednesday afternoon, and now police are looking for the gunman.The incident occurred at approximately 3:00 p.m. in the town of Millis, about 20 miles southwest of Boston, according to Massachusetts State Police.Shepard Smith reported that police have confirmed that an officer was in the vehicle when it was struck by at least one bullet. The officer then ran his car off the road and crashed it, causing the vehicle to catch fire.Police have said they are not aware of any injuries at this time.Shep reported that witnesses say they saw a white man fire a gun from a dark-colored, possibly maroon, pickup truck.State and local police, along with fire investigators, are taking part in the investigation and search for the gunman.Via: FOX News",politics,"Sep 2, 2015"
7431, KKK Just Threatened An 84-Year-Old Woman Who Fled Hitler After She Criticized Trump,"An elderly Massachussetts woman who wrote a letter to the Boston Globe denouncing Donald Trump now fears for her life after the Ku Klux Klan responded to her legitimate criticism of their favored presidential candidate. Louise Mayerson has been through a lot in her 84 years on this planet, coming from a  family who was forced to flee Austria when she was a child to escape Adolf Hitler s regime   but now she is forced to relive the terror her family felt as they fled the Nazis.Mayerson  s letter, published March 2, criticizes Trump s initial reticence in denouncing the numerous, numerous white supremacists who have publicly endorsed him:I AM an Austrian refugee from the time of Hitler who has been a US citizen for more than 70 years. I have found some alarming rhetoric coming from Donald Trump that is apparently finding approval from large numbers of my fellow Americans. With Trump s rather ambiguous response concerning his disavowal of the support of former Klansman David Duke, I have reached my breaking point ( Trump wavers on disavowing ex-KKK member,  Page A2, Feb. 29).We all know the opinions and actions the Ku Klux Klan stands for. Among the fellow Americans the KKK has sought out for its venom are American Jews. Trump s failure to immediately repudiate Duke chilled my blood.I can see myself needing to flee once more and perhaps return to my native country in Europe, where hateful rhetoric is now strictly forbidden and punishable by law. My outrage grows and grows and grows,  Mayerson said in an interview following the publication of her letter.  And it s flamed by the irresponsible actions, frankly, of Donald Trump. Unfortunately, the 84-year-old s expression of her completely legitimate misgivings about Trump s association with white supremacists was enough to throw them into a fit of rage. Days later, she received an envelop postmarked in Boston, There was no return address   after all, the Klan isn t exactly known for being forthcoming with their identities. There wasn t even a letter. Enclosed was a single Klan symbol: I believe somebody just read that letter, it touched a nerve, and that s the way they reacted,  Mayerson said. She contacted Arlington police, who are currently investigating the matter. They also contacted the Human Rights Commission, which assists hate crime victims. Mayerson says she is pleased with law enforcement s response, and that she is distressed by the   poisonous atmosphere that has been created  by Trump s rhetoric that can   lead to some pretty unpleasant things for all of us. Robert O. Trestan, regional director of the Anti-Defamation League, says that Trump s rhetoric will help this sort of thing to become commonplace: The more that hateful and denigrating speech becomes commonplace in the public realm from leaders, the greater the likelihood that people will start acting up, whether it s harassment via the mail or violence. A Trump spokeswoman refused to comment on the incident, though she did point out that the candidate did finally denounce his David Duke endorsement after he was unable to handle the media scrutiny: Mr. Trump has disavowed David Duke, the KKK and all other groups that espouse similar views. He will continue to do so. Trump may say he disavows the KKK and other white supremacists, but in the past he has tweeted some of their propaganda. In fact, based on a week of data collection, 62 percent of the people Trump retweets are white supremacists. Unfortunately, The Donald is exactly the sort of person who is popular with the White Power Rangers in the United States   and as long as we tolerate his hate speech, we can expect that this sort of thing will become the new normal.Featured image via YouTube",News,"March 18, 2016"
15970,THE PURGE: NYC Mayor De Blasio to Review ‘All Symbols of Hate” on City Property,"THE PURGE CONTINUES THE NYC MAYOR has just opened a can of worms so big that it ll be hard to control it. He wants to review  all symbols of hate  on city property then leave it to his panel of  experts  to decide what stays and what goes. This should be interesting. Isn t this subjective? Someone might think one thing is a symbol of hate but not another. Where does this purging end?Mayor de Blasio said late Wednesday that the city will conduct a 90-day review of  all symbols of hate on city property  in the wake of violence sparked by white supremacist groups in Charlottesville, Virginia over the weekend.A 32-year-old woman was killed and more than a dozen people were injured when a vehicle slammed into a group of counter-protesters on Saturday, and two state troopers died when the helicopter from which they were monitoring events suddenly crashed.Opposition to the removal of a statue of Confederate Army general Robert E. Lee was at the heart of rallies by white nationalists and KKK members in Charlottesville this year.New York City officials said they re putting together a panel of  relevant experts and community leaders  who will define the criteria and make recommendations for which items to remove.EXPERTS? WHO SAYS?MEANWHILE IN THE EAST VILLAGEThe South is rising   in the East Village.Residents are seeing red over a pair of Confederate flags hanging in the window of an East 8th Street apartment building, following the deadly white power rally in Virginia this week.The flags have been hanging in the fifth-floor window of the building near the corner of Avenue D for months, but anger is boiling over in the aftermath of the weekend s carnage   with neighbors pelting rocks and bricks at the window Wednesday morning. They re scary, we don t know who we are dealing with in the neighborhood. I feel uncomfortable because that represents evil. I see the protests in the news and I come home and see this,  said local Louise Abddhal, 56, as a chorus of others yelled at the window.Residents had turned a blind eye to the offensive banners in the past, but started getting mad after Saturday s rally in Charlottesville, where a neo-Nazi fatally mowed down counter-protester Heather Hayer. It s been there forever and no one said anything. Now it s going crazy. Virginia is bringing more light and attention too,  said longtime resident Janet Brown. .The Dixie-head has changed the flags around several times   there was a  neo-Nazi  one for awhile, according to Brown   and he now has two Israeli flags and an American flag between the Confederate ones.But the baffling collection is just making residents angrier. He is a Jew with a Confederate flag! Are you kidding me?  said one neighbor, who wouldn t give his name. Confederate flags in the window, bro! That is a bunch of racists. Right here in the avenue, bro! In the hood! This sh-t is real. He is looking to start a f ing riot. The building s property manager said he s aware of the flags and is trying to get the resident to take them down.Footage of a man throwing rocks and screaming expletives at the windows on Wednesday morning shows police arriving and telling him to stop   but witnesses say cops didn t make any arrests.Via: NYP",Government News,"Aug 16, 2017"

This is why the American people are so FED UP with the main stream media Perhaps MSNBC should practice what they preach and start telling the truth. You have to ask yourself how these people stay employed when they can t even tell the truth about either POTUS. The funny thing to watch in the video is just how serious they are when discussing the topic of lying. It really is the definition of irony Washington Examiner columnist Tim Carney called out a NYT reporter on  Morning Joe  Friday over the latter s report that President Barack Obama told just 18 distinct lies during his two terms in office.CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS?Both of these reporters and the entire panel are absolutely bonkers for even having this discussion! This is a perfect example of just how off kilter these so-called  journalists  are. Do they not have anything else to report???The New York Times juxtaposed President Donald Trump with Obama on lies told in office in a report Thursday, with the newspaper claiming Obama told 18 distinct falsehoods during his entire presidency compared to Trump s 103 in less than a year in office.The Free Beacon reported that Obama, according to fact-checker PolitiFact, had made 98 separate  mostly false,   false,  and  pants on fire  statements in his administration, with the Times leaving many of them out of its analysis.Carney wrote a piece for the Examiner in which he stated Trump was  far more detached from the truth  than most politicians, but he hit the newspaper for omitting so many of Obama s lies from the piece, such as claiming during a State of the Union address that his administration had eliminated lobbyists from policy-making jobs.Carney said it didn t seem to be a proper use of  data journalism  to say one would count up the lies when it left out so many of Obama s.

23180,WARNING: Don’t Worry If the Stock Market Goes Crazy After Election," BloombergIn the hours after the president is elected, equity investors need to brace for volatility. What they shouldn t do is panic.That s because regardless of how prices react on Nov. 9, next-day moves in the S&P 500 Index are useless in telling what comes after.While the index swings an average 1.5 percent the day after the vote, gains or losses over the first 24 hours predict the market s direction 12 months later less than half the time.This matters because the compulsion to act in the vote s aftermath is often very strong   stocks swing twice as violently as normal those days, data compiled by Bloomberg show. They plummeted 5 percent just after Barack Obama beat John McCain in 2008. But while nothing says Wednesday s reaction won t be a harbinger for the year, nothing says it will, either, and investors should think before doing anything rash.  Trying to trade that is very difficult,  said Thomas Melcher, the Philadelphia-based chief investment officer at PNC Asset Management Group.  Even if the market sells off, if you have any reasonable time horizon, that should be a buying opportunity. The dust will settle and people will conclude the economy is OK.

23270,"SYRIA CEASEFIRE? Lavrov, Kerry Agree to Fight Al-Nusra, No Strikes on ‘Rebels,’ Aleppo Relief","21st Century Wire says After a long drawn out round of bilateral peace talks in Geneva Switzerland this week, Russia and the United States announced a plan for a 48 hour ceasefire in Syria, scheduled to take effect at sundown Monday.Incredibly, the cornerstone of this agreement rests on Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and US Secretary of State John Kerry, both agreeing (for now anyway) that they would both be targeting the terrorist  opposition  force, Al Nusra Front (al Qaeda in Syria, supported covertly by both the Saudi Arabia and the US/CIA) who recently  rebranded  themselves to  Jabhat Fateh Al-Sham  in cynical desperate move to avoid being targeted by military airstrikes.Back in May, when another ceasefire was proposed, 21WIRE warned that it was only a ploy by the US to buy more time for  rebels  to re-arm and repair broken rat lines from Turkey into northern Syria. That turned out to be 100% correct, despite the fact the western media outlets were duped by Washington s desperate diplomatic ploy   reinforced by a multi-million dollar, New York City-based PR campaign targeting social media and funded by George Soros and others, which was marketed using the tagline #AleppoIsBurning.Are we seeing more of the same this week in Geneva?For a comprehensive analysis on what this latest temporary ceasefire agree really means, and where it could be heading, watch his excellent segment featuring political analyst Ammar Waqqaf. Watch: According to Kerry, the plan is to ensure that Syrian government forces will not carry out combat missions where the so-called moderate opposition is present.Speaking of fight against Al-Nusra and its efforts to blend with moderate rebels, Kerry stressed  going on Al-Nusra is not a concession to anybody  but  is profoundly in the interests of the US.

Taking the floor, the Russian FM confirmed that Russia and US had agreed to coordinate airstrikes in Syria,  provided there is a sustained period of reduced violence. The first step toward the implementation of this clause will be a 48-hour ceasefire in Syria, Lavrov said.Lavrov elaborated that the ceasefire comes into effect on September 12 and should last for at least seven days.( ) Despite the mistrust and attempt to disrupt what we have agreed upon, we managed to work out a package of documents, there are five of them. It allows us to set an effective coordination in the fight against terrorism, to expand the humanitarian access to distressed population, first and foremost in Aleppo,  Lavrov said.Due to the sensitive nature of the information contained in the agreements, they will not be made available to general public, Lavrov said. We cannot make these documents public. They contain rather serious, sensitive information. We don t want it to fall into hands of those who would surely try to disrupt the implementation of the measures stipulated within in the framework of humanitarian delivery supplies and in other parts of our agreements.

Nightmare For The Left [VIDEO],"President Donald Trump s Senior Counselor Kellyanne Conway clarified a comment in which she mistakenly referred to a  Bowling Green Massacre. She said Friday on Twitter that she meant to say  terrorists  instead of  massacre,  referencing a 2013 ABC News story on two suspected terrorists living as refugees in Kentucky.According to the story:  The discovery in 2009 of two al Qaeda-Iraq terrorists living as refugees in Bowling Green, Kentucky   who later admitted in court that they d attacked U.S. soldiers in Iraq   prompted the bureau to assign hundreds of specialists to an around-the-clock effort aimed at checking its archive of 100,000 improvised explosive devices collected in the war zones, known as IEDs, for other suspected terrorists  fingerprints. An undercover FBI operation exposes Al Qaeda terrorists posing as refugees in the middle of the American heartland. They quickly learned the laxed background checks were to blame. But it turns out that may be just the beginning. There may be dozens more now in this country as well.The video below shows an admitted Al Qaeda terrorist who had already killed American soldiers in Iraq, trying to get weapons to kill more of them. And Authorities tell ABC News he may be just one of dozens of men with American blood on their hands where mistakenly allowed to settle in the US as refugees.The two men came from Iraq 4 years ago among tens of thousands of refugees who the State Department approved to come here, seen as  no threat to the US . But the two were in fact, as the FBI says part of an Al Qaeda connected insurgent group that had already killed American soldiers with road side bombs.

22925,"John McCain Throws Tantrum, Decries Trump for ‘Letting Assad Stay’","21st Century Wire says A predictable reaction from a pair of increasingly desperate politicians.Perennial war hawks Senators John McCain and his partner Lindsey Graham, have expressed their outrage of recent comments by Trump Administration officials that regime change is no longer a priority for the Washington.McCain warned that President Trump s downgrading on policy, away from the overthrow of the Syrian government, was somehow bad for US interests.  Such a policy would only exacerbate the terrorist threat to our nation,  said McCain.Since at least 2011, McCain has been intimately involved in helping to foment instability in Syria by leading the program to flood illegal arms into Syria for what he and many other America politicians claimed was for  the moderate rebels  who were  fighting for freedom and democracy.  It wasn t long before the world finally figured out what the Syrian people knew all along   the moderate rebel was a public relation tool, invented by Washington under the Obama Administration.Sadly for McCain, he hasn t been following the news close enough over the last 3 years to realize that the rest of the world has already figured out the West s transparent proxy terrorist marketing campaign.While McCain s public position is predictable   still clinging to the fictional narrative laid down by Obama   that the Syria public do not support their President and is therefore illegitimate in the eyes of NATO member states, his partner Senator Graham s position is even more erroneous; based on the a long-debunked lie that Assad crossed the  red line  and used chemical weapons against his own people. McCain with CIA-backed FSA commander Sam Idris and Mouaz Moustafa of the Washington s creation, the  Syrian Emergency Task Force  (SETF).What makes McCain s rantings even more obscene, is the fact that he has remained completely pro-war in all its forms, and is in total support of proven international terrorists groups like Al Nusra, the  Free Syrian Army  FSA and Arar al-Sham. In 2011, McCain snuck into Syria illegally to promise militants weapons and support, as well as a US bombing campaign against the Syrian state   a war which almost happened under the pretext of a staged false flag chemical attack in East Ghouta outside Damascus in August 2013. BUSY YEAR: 2011 was a busy year for McCain and Graham supporting militants and terrorists. Here they are pictured with Florida Senator Marco Rubio showing off with extremists after the assassination of Gaddafi and before the eventual implosion of the country following the US-led NATO bombing campaign.  Supreme Military Council of Syria meeting US Rep. Adam Kinzinger, Mouaz Moustaf (SETF), and CIA agent Evan McMullin (circa 2013-2014)Since 2011, John McCain, Lindsey Graham, Hillary Clinton, US Congressman Adam Kinzinger and others, in conjunction with Romney-backed CIA operative turned 2016 Presidential candidate Evan McMullin   have led calls to support the various terrorist factions within Syria under the CIA crafted banner of  Supreme Military Council of Syria  and the  The Syrian Revolutionary Front    have consistently sold the American public a false narrative via by the Muslim Brotherhood, an extremist political organization supported by Obama administration.4 years later, they are still droning on with the same discredited talking points  Daniel Chaitin Washington ExaminerSens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham are upset with the Trump administration signaling that removing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad from power is no longer a top priority.During a trip to Turkey, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Assad s fate will be decided by the Syrian people. That sentiment was echoed by U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, who told reporters,  You pick and choose your battles. And when we re looking at this it s about changing up priorities and our priority is no longer to sit and focus on getting Assad out. In a statement Thursday evening, McCain, who is chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said he is  deeply disturbed  by Tillerson s and Haley s comments. Their suggestion that Assad can stay in power appears to be just as devoid of strategy as President Obama s pronouncements that  Assad must go,'  McCain said.  Once again, U.S. policy in Syria is being presented piecemeal in press statements without any definition of success, let alone a realistic plan to achieve it. Graham, also a member of the Armed Services committee, said that such comments would be  the biggest mistake since President Obama failed to act after drawing a red line against Assad s use of chemical weapons.

9374,BALL FAMILY MEMBER Reveals SICK Reason LaVar Ball Allegedly Wouldn’t Let His Sons See Their Mother After “Surgery To Remove Portion of Her Skull”,"Last week, President Trump stepped in and interceded on behalf of three young UCLA basketball players who foolishly were caught shoplifting in China. Shoplifting in China is not treated lightly and most likely would have resulted in a prison term for all three young men. President Trump was able to convince China s President Xi, however, to release the three young men from custody. When asked how the loudmouth father of  LiAngelo Ball felt about President Trump helping to secure the release of his son, LiAngelo, LaVar Ball suggested the President had little to do with the matter. Who?  Ball told ESPN when asked about Trump s involvement in the situation.  What was he over there for? Don t tell me nothing. Everybody wants to make it seem like he helped me out. They try to make a big deal out of nothing sometimes.  I m from L.A. I ve seen a lot worse things happen than a guy taking some glasses. President Trump took to Twitter to reply to LaVar Ball s ignorant comments:Now that the three basketball players are out of China and saved from years in jail, LaVar Ball, the father of LiAngelo, is unaccepting of what I did for his son and that shoplifting is no big deal. I should have left them in jail!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 19, 2017So who is this crackpot LaVar Ball, and why would anyone in their right mind make such arrogant and ignorant remarks after the President of the United States just helped their son to escape a prison sentence in a foreign country?  Andrew Stephens of the Armchair All Americans did a pretty good job of summing up what a horrible human being the self-serving, money, and fame-obsessed LaVar Ball really is. In his article, Stephens reveals a sick man, who is so controlling of his 3 sons and their basketball careers, that he wouldn t even let them visit their very sick mother in the hospital, over fears that it could create media attention that could damage his merchandise brand. On March 15, 2017, Andrew Stephens of Armchair All Americans published an article about Lavar Ball titled Lavar Ball: The epitome of what is wrong with modern sports. It touched on helicopter parenting and the monetization of potentially profitable children.Stephens claimed that in the article, without commenting on upbringing tactics, I attempted to delve into Lavar Ball s seemingly unnecessary promotion of his own sons for his personal benefit.About an hour after the article was run, I received a comment on it from a member of the Ball family, who wishes to remain anonymous. The comment (which has since been removed to protect the email address and identity of the commenter) read as follows:- Wow. You nailed it. Although you don t even know the half of it. Lavar took over the high school program, added the Coach, his puppet (which is why he quit last year after becoming the national coach of the year) and Lavar stepped on and crushed countless other kids  careers and love for the game to get his kids on the court. If you are allowed to shoot at any time from any where and never come out of the game, any decent idiot could score 30 points.Also, Tina Ball, his wife had a stroke on Feb 21. She had life threatening skull surgery to relieve brain pressure   guess where Lavar was during the operation that could have killed his wife?   at the CHHS vs. LB Poly game with his sons, including Lonzo. He still has not allowed his kids to see their sick mother due to the media attention it would bring to him, and cause BBB sales to diminish. [Name of hospital] in [City of hospital], CA   Tina is there now and he only visits for 1 hour a few days a week, while her Mother has yet to leave her side. Pathetic!!! I was a bit skeptical when I initially viewed the comment. I figured that it was someone attempting to drive a smear campaign against the Ball family, seeing how Lavar was such a polarizing figure. But, the information was oddly specific.After a bit of deliberation, I contacted the email address listed with the comment. They confirmed through multiple email and social media confirmations that they were, in fact, a close relative of Lavar and Tina Ball. I also spoke with the hospital listed in the email. The hospital confirmed that Tina Ball was checked in as of 12:30 PM EST on March 15.Tina, who was very active on Twitter, stopped communication on February 19, which fits in with the timeline provided below by a member of the Ball family.Watch this video as the loud-mouth, obnoxious LaVar Ball is interviewed on the Skip and Shannon Undisputed sports show.One of the first questions the female host asked of LaVar was about his desire to have a reality show made about him and his family (Keep in mind, this interview took place shortly after a very serious stroke). It s hard not to pick up on the sadness expressed on the face of his oldest son Lonzo Ball, while his overbearing father dominates the conversation and makes a complete ass of himself:When confirming the identity of the member of the Ball family that commented via email, we received another large piece of harrowing information: Notice, she is not at any games, she is not at work, and she is not at home. Someone needs to ask the question, where is Tina? She is severely disabled and paralyzed on right side. Cannot talk and is questionable about her comprehension. Left side of her brain impacted with massive stroke, while at home on Feb. 21 (school holiday   President s day). Tina is a PE teacher in [City of school],CA [Name of school].Feb. 20: Tina Ball admitted at [Name of first hospital] ICUFeb. 21: Surgery to remove a portion of her skull to reduce swelling from the stroke (evening)Feb 21: Chino Hills vs LB Poly @ Cerritos College   evening game (same time as surgery) Lavar & Lonzo at the game with the other Ball boys   missed the surgery and post op. Did not come to hospital during or after surgery. The Ball boys are not allowed to see their mother, Lavar is afraid it will take away from their game(s). Lonzo had big game at ASU and U of A later that week. Also, media buzz would take away from all the interviews and media touring for Lavar + BBB brand would suffer. It literally is bigger than Tina s life, as evidenced by Lavar s approach. As a family member, I am embarrassed and feel so sorry for Tina, since Lavar is on a media tour, he visits her rarely, while her mother has stayed by her side continuously. The crux of the original story was rooted in that fact that Lavar Ball s priorities were self-motivated and not for the betterment of a  family brand.  After hearing the explicit details given to us, if these allegations are true   it only confirms one thing for Lavar Ball: money and fame are king.LaVar recently attempted to sell his Ball s Big Baller Brand for a billion dollars. When major shoe companies laughed at his offer, he raised his price to 3 billion dollars. How Ball ever got his product line this far is really quite amazing.  When LaVar Ball said he wanted $1 billion for a Big Baller Brand co-branding shoe deal for his three sons, the big shoe companies scoffed.After that rejection, Big Baller Brand released Lonzo Ball s first signature shoe, the ZO2, and decided to charge a minimum of $495 for a pair. LaVar told Colin Cowherd on Wednesday that companies like Nike, Adidas and Under Armour will regret not forking over $1 billion and that he s decided to raise the price for a deal. Now that Lonzo s headed to Los Angeles, what they should have done is give me a billion dollars and let me be on my way,  LaVar said, referring to the Lakers drawing the No. 2 pick in next month s NBA draft.But now? Apparently, the draft lottery results tripled Big Baller Brand s value. Now you know if they want to talk to me now, it just went up to $3 billion. Triple B s billion, billion, billion,  he told Sports Illustrated.LaVar had a chance to fix his embarrassing error of disrespecting the President for the gift he gave their family, but instead chose to double down on stupid, in one of the most painfully ignorant interviews you will ever witness, with CNN s Chris Cuomo:",politics,"Nov 21, 2017"

With only $4.7 million available, it s gonna be difficult to throw a coronation for Hillary. Already struggling with finances, the Democratic Party has drafted a plan to have taxpayers help pay about $20 million for next summer s nominating convention, reversing a change Congress approved just a year ago.Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who is also a congresswoman from Florida, has drafted a bill to restore money that both parties used to receive from the federal government to help defray the costs of running their quadrennial conventions.The Congressional Budget Office revealed the move in a letter released Friday, which said Ms. Wasserman Schultz s proposal to tap a presidential campaign fund would likely mean each party could get about $20 million in taxpayer money to help with costs.The DNC is facing tough financial circumstances. The latest report shows it had just $4.7 million in cash on hand as of Oct. 31, less than the $6.9 million in debts the committee reported. By contrast, the Republican National Committee reported $20.4 million in cash, offset by $1.9 million in debts.Neither the DNC nor Ms. Wasserman Schultz s congressional office returned messages seeking comment on her plans.Republican National Committee spokeswoman Allison Moore said the party doesn t need the help.Read more: WT",politics,"Dec 14, 2015"
12813,U Of WI STUDENTS SELL Hateful Hoodies: “All White People Are Racists”…Message Promoting Violence Against Cops,"University of Wisconsin Madison, where NOT to send your kids to school The sale of hateful racist sweatshirts or hoodies on campus is really not surprising considering the University of WI Madison has been a hotbed for radical students and faculty for quite some time now. We shared a story about a U of WI Madison student who was given cover by his professor when the police came to talk to him during class after he was caught on camera spray painting racist graffiti all over school property.  Students at the University of Wisconsin-Madison are asking people to buy sweatshirts promoting violence against police officers and classifying all white people as racists. Racism,  claims one hoodie s page,  is a set of systematic, institutional, cultural, and epistemological (although not limited to said forms) structures that inherently empowers white folk and in turn disempowers people of color. This power dictates who lives, have housing, access to education/healthcare etc. Racism has little to do with hatred and mostly to do with who has power. White folk or those who see themselves as white are given said power inherently regardless of socioeconomic class, education etc. This is why white men created race in the first place to maintain power. Racism gave birth to the idea of race. This is a [sic] oversimplified definition,  the description continues.Facebook has already removed an original picture of the sweatshirt for not following Facebook s Community Standards. However, as of this writing, Facebook has yet to remove the post selling the sweatshirts.One of the sweatshirt says  If I Encounter Another Cop With A God Complex I m Going To Have To Show The World That They Are Human , seemingly promoting violence towards police.Via: Campus Reform",politics,"Oct 6, 2016"

DeLauro doesn t get to decide for us what s a gun that s ok to own. It might be a good idea to pick up the phone and voice your objection to this bill.Gun owners would receive tax breaks for voluntarily turning in high-powered assault rifles under new legislation proposed Monday.The Support Assault Firearm Elimination and Education of our (SAFER) Streets Act expected to be reintroduced next week by Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) would provide gun owners with an incentive to turn in their firearms to local police departments. Assault weapons are not about hunting, or even self-defense,  DeLauro said.  There is no reason on earth, other than to kill as many people as possible in as short a time as possible, that anyone needs a gun designed for a battlefield. Though DeLauro is in favor of stronger guns laws that would completely ban assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition, she emphasized this bill would not force gun owners to turn in their firearms. The legislation would provide up to $2,000 in tax credits for gun owners who voluntarily hand over assault weapons to their local police departments.The assault weapons legislation comes in response to the horrific mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., DeLauro s home state, in December 2012.Via: The Hill",Government News,"Apr 6, 2015"
19126,"THE TEA PARTY IS MAKING A COMEBACK! Conservatives Reorganize…Mobilize To Fight Back Against Rent-A-Mob Democrats, Hold Congress Accountable [VIDEO]","As liberal protesters step up confrontations with Republican lawmakers, leaders of the original Tea Party movement that wrote the book on those tactics are reassembling their political army   dispatching activists to push a conservative agenda that includes tax reform and dismantling ObamaCare.FreedomWorks, Tea Party Patriots and other groups are looking to keep pressure on GOP lawmakers to keep their 2016 campaign promises, and not buckle in the face of rowdy town hall protesters angry about the prospect of repealing the Affordable Care Act. A lot of people were elected to Congress based on bold promises about ObamaCare, tax reform and regulatory reform,  Noah Wall, FreedomWorks  national director of campaigns, told Fox News.  We have to hold them to campaign promises, keep up the momentum and the energy. It s time to get off the bench and get this to work. FreedomWorks plans to mobilize its network of grassroots organizations and unite with the Tea Party Patriots on March 15 for a  Day of Action  on Capitol Hill that will include a rally and visits to members of Congress.The group will follow up with a  Month of Action,  set to include members driving constituents to congressional district offices and larger-scale rallies across the country to amplify their fiscally conservative message.Wall says his group and its supporters want to capitalize on Republicans now controlling Congress and the White House, and achieve long-awaited policy objectives. If successful, their efforts could mark a revival of the eight-year-old Tea Party movement   a political revolt against big government under then-President Obama that crested with Republicans  historic 2010 House takeover. Tea Party Patriots national coordinator Jenny Beth Martin on Wednesday said the upcoming Capitol Hill events are to  make sure Republicans stay focused on repealing ObamaCare  and her group will follow up with its own busy month   including daily, micro-focused activities like  Message Monday  and  Tweet Tuesday. She bristled at the suggestion the Tea Party movement has emerged from hibernation, arguing it was instrumental over the past several election cycles in helping Republicans take control of the House, Senate and then the White House. We are not dead, and we have never gone away,  Martin told Fox News.

7090, The US Supreme Court Has Bad News For The American People And The GOP Is To Blame,"The vacancy left by Scalia and the inevitable 4-4 ties bound to happen have left the court no choice but to deliver sorry and crippling news to the American public: The court will hear but a fraction of the cases it normally would in a session, with a mere three cases scheduled since Scalia died.The Supreme Court of the United States is tasked under article 3 section 2 with the power to decide all cases in law and equity arising under the Constitution, to interpret the laws of the nation and to be the final word in the legality of all of our treaties. The Judicial branch of the government determines precedent often over cases the people and their elected representatives can t agree on by interpreting their letter and spirit as it applies to our society as well as the intentions of the founders.That s quite a mouthful and a set of expectations that all too often fall by the wayside in favor of partisan politics. That s not to say that the court doesn t have its moments. Centrist judges and even partisan players have often taken their robes and their positions as seriously as they should, such as with the recent decisions on Obamacare subsidies and gay marriage. On the other hand, when you have to sit back and witness the destruction of the Voters Rights Act, once again the issue of partisanship comes into play. Partisan or not, the court is tasked with those decisions, and it has nine justices for a reason. Ties at the highest court of the land don t work.No matter how you view the court, its role in our government is imperative. The death of Justice Scalia and the obstructionist GOP-led senate hasn t just hampered the court s ability to function, it has rendered it nearly inoperable. Between late February and Early April, the court hears eight cases on average with a high of eleven in 2011.The reason is simple: The court isn t interested in wasting time by hearing cases that will end in a deadlock. It s counter-productive to maintaining the rule of law and a massive waste of time and resources. As a result, the court has heard cases with little consequence or controversy. The court has agreed to hear eight cases in total this term, which runs until January 2017, five of which were scheduled while Scalia was still alive. The court typically hears upwards of 70 cases in a term.That means we can forget about integral decisions on archaic abortion laws, redistricting, campaign reform, and a plethora of other issues already ruled on by lower conservative judges until sometime in 2017, or whenever the Democrats regain the Senate if Clinton or Sanders are elected this November. The Republican party doesn t play fair. Their tactics are bush league at best. By obstructing the executive branch and holding the judicial branch hostage, the GOP has effectively destroyed the republic they claim to be saving.Featured image by Win McNamara, Getty Images",News,"April 4, 2016"
2246," Trump Says Republican ‘Make America Sick Again’ Bill Is ‘Wonderful,’ Stands By Utter Failure","Donald Trump thinks the healthcare bill Republicans passed to repeal the Affordable Care Act is  wonderful  and promised even more such bills to come. We are sooo screwed.After years of trying to repeal the landmark healthcare law, House Republicans passed a bill on Monday that they dubiously named the  American Healthcare Act. Except that there is nothing  American  about it, nor does it provide healthcare to anyone who needs it.The monstrous bill pretty much leaves 30 million Americans out in the cold without insurance. Republicans stripped subsidies away from low-income Americans and will give them to families who can actually afford to pay for healthcare without government aid. The bill also wipes out the Medicaid expansion that allowed millions more to obtain coverage. Furthermore, the bill kills the insurance mandate, which guaranteed that enough Americans would have health insurance that the insurance pool would be able to cover people with pre-existing conditions. The bill also makes senior citizens pay more for healthcare and defunds Planned Parenthood, which would strip low-income women of the health services they need, including cancer screenings.Overall, the bill a big  fuck you  from Republicans to the American people. So, of course, Trump loves it.Trump crowed about the Republican bill and then attacked the Affordable Care Act by claiming that it is  imploding.However, it s only  imploding  because Trump and Republicans are sabotaging it so it doesn t work the way it should.Our wonderful new Healthcare Bill is now out for review and negotiation. ObamaCare is a complete and total disaster   is imploding fast!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 7, 2017Trump then tweeted that this bill is only the first  phase  of his plan to destroy healthcare in this country. And he actually thinks that  getting rid of state lines  will bring the cost of healthcare down.Don t worry, getting rid of state lines, which will promote competition, will be in phase 2 & 3 of healthcare rollout. @foxandfriends  Donald J.

So bad, in fact, that four Republican senators are prepared to oppose it, which means it will be dead on arrival in the Senate. A majority of Americans support the Affordable Care Act and the protections and benefits it provides.

3245, Trump Can Be Arrested By The NYPD And This Military Veteran Explains Why,"It would be a great sight to behold if a New York City police officer were ordered to place Donald Trump in handcuffs. People would cheer.And it could happen if New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman has enough evidence to charge Trump with crimes related to his fraudulent  charity. The Trump Foundation is currently under investigation for self-dealing, which means the foundation paid out donations to its own officers, which is illegal and totally unethical and immoral.Money that should have been used to help cure cancer has instead benefited Trump personally as he has used foundation money to buy stuff for himself, pay legal fees and settlements, and pay executives involved in running the scam.Trump, of course, whined on Twitter about the investigation, claiming that 100 percent of funds go to charities.I gave millions of dollars to DJT Foundation, raised or recieved millions more, ALL of which is given to charity, and media won t report!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 27, 2016The DJT Foundation, unlike most foundations, never paid fees, rent, salaries or any expenses. 100% of money goes to wonderful charities!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 27, 2016But Trump is lying because even the Trump Foundation admitted to self-dealing in their 2015 tax returns to the IRS.Trump even thought he could escape the legal system by simply shuttering the foundation, but Schneiderman s office informed him that he can t  legally dissolve until that investigation is complete. And if that investigation finds that Trump broke the law, he would be subject to charges and arrest. And as military veteran and blogger David Axe points out, there is precedent for an NYPD officer to arrest Trump and haul his ass to jail. President-elect Donald Trump could be in big legal trouble over his allegedly self-dealing charity,  Axe began.  It s entirely possible that he could eventually face arrest. And it wouldn t be unprecedented if, say, a New York cop actually slapped cuffs on Trump and read him his rights. After all, a ballsy policeman arrested Pres. Ulysses Grant way back in 1866   albeit for a comparatively minor crime. It s not unprecedented for a small-time cop to arrest America s commander-in-chief. In 1866, Pres. Ulysses Grant got busted for riding his horse at an unsafe speed at 13th and M Streets in Washington, D.C. The arresting officer, William West, had previously issued Grant a warning for the same offense. Do you think, officer, that I was violating the speed laws?  Grant reportedly asked West. I certainly do, Mr. President,  West replied.  I am very sorry, Mr. President, to have to do it, for you are the nation s chief executive, but my duty is plain, sir. I shall have to place you under arrest! Do your duty, my good man,  Grant said. West escorted the president to the police station for booking. Grant paid a fine and walked free. Officer and president reportedly became friends after the incident.Yes, this really happened. And stealing money from charities is a hell of a lot worse of a crime than speeding while riding a horse.In fact, the precedent of arresting sitting presidents for breaking the law goes back even further. Franklin Pierce was arrested in 1853 for running a lady over with his horse. The case was dropped due to lack of evidence.But the points stands. Police officers can arrest the president for violating the law and it sure looks like Trump violated it repeatedly.As Axe points out, however, Trump probably won t go quietly. If a New York cop arrests Trump, it seems unlikely that the notoriously temperamental Trump   and his equally angry private security detail   will react as gentlemanly as Grant did to his own arrest,  he concluded.Frankly, Trump should be thrown in a prison cell next to Ponzi schemer Bernie Madoff. Because while Madoff only scammed rich people, Trump stole money from kids with cancer to pay his employees and his legal bills. That s truly deplorable.Featured image via Capitol Hill Blue",News,"December 28, 2016"
15103,Could Newt Gingrich Save The Republican Party By Becoming Speaker Of The House?,"He d like to build a giant wall, deport illegals, defund Planned Parenthood and deal with our debt crisis. These are all issues Newt Gingrich believes need to be dealt with. Given his past history as Speaker, he may just be the guy to get the job done Newt Gingrich told Breitbart Editor-in-Chief Alexander Marlow on Saturday that if he had the votes in congress to reclaim the Speaker of the House position, he would accept.Gingrich acknowledged that if he had 218 house members backing him as Speaker, who approved of his strategy on the continuing resolution, and his strategy on dealing with the debt ceiling, he would have a  moral obligation to serve the country. Gingrich, who served as Speaker in the 90 s during the Clinton Administration, initially made light of this provocative possibility by reminding listeners to Breitbart News Saturday on Sirius XM Patriot radio, channel 125, of the time when conservative icon William F. Buckley was asked while running for Mayor of New York: if he was elected, what would he do? Buckley said that the first thing he would do is demand a recount.Later in the interview, the consummate historian side of Gingrich emerged. He waxed more philosophical, relating that George Washington never sought elected office, but when called upon to serve, he did so.The architect of the  Contract with America  in 1994, which proposed ten policies the GOP promised to a vote on during the first hundred days of the new Congress, cautioned current house members to  slow down  when picking their next Speaker. Gingrich asserted that the House chamber must break down into lengthy conferences among themselves and vet candidates not on personality, but on their ability to articulate strategy.The former Speaker asserted that House leadership needs to have a sound strategy on how to deal with the continuing resolution that comes up in December and the debt ceiling.  Unless they have a strategy in dealing with these kind of issues, they will just rapidly undermine the next speaker and be right back in the middle of a bitter internal fight that they don t need,  he said.Marlow asked Gingrich his position on funding Planned Parenthood and the possibility of a government shutdown.  I would have a hard time voting for a bill that funded it,  he replied.  Even if it meant a shutdown?  inquired Marlow.  Let me repeat myself. I would have a very hard time voting for a bill that funded Planned Parenthood,  Gingrich replied.Gingrich said that Republicans have to make it clear that they are not defunding women s health.  Here is the money, we are not defunding women s health,  needs to be expressed. He recommends that congress apply the exact same dollars for women s health to other organizations, including religious groups, but not to be complicit in   a process that cuts up babies. We should say how can the president of the Unites States defend cutting up babies, and if Obama wants to close the government over his commitment to cutting up babies, then I would say let s have the fight. Regarding immigration, Gingrich told Marlow that he just came back from Israel.  You can t spend time in Israel and not believe that fences work. People who say you can t build a fence are just wrong,  he maintains. He added that Trump is right on this, and that building 95-story sky-scrapers is more complicated than building fences.The ten time re-elected congressman from Georgia stressed that there must be a strong e-verify network in place, but it would be implausible to round up and deport all who came across American borders illegally.  We are not going to deport 11 million people. We are not going to go into neighborhoods, we re not going to tear up churches, not going to tear up families. No American system could tolerate that level of personal and dehumanizing process. Gingrich does think, however, that America could aggressively deport criminals.  People in neighborhoods would be grateful that you got rid of the criminals,  he insisted.  MS13 Gang from El Salvador, which is now in 70 cities, should be utterly, totally unacceptable to every American. The conservative icon added that he finds that when he meets with legal immigrants across the nation, they are the  strongest supporters of insisting on legality. Because they paid their dues; they did the right things. They followed the law. They would like to see an America insisting on returning to that. Gingrich maintains there should be a  pathway to legality,  but rejects offering them citizenship before those  waiting patiently  who apply legally. There could be exceptions for some who would enter the military. If one is willing to  risk their lives  for America, extenuating circumstances may apply in that case, Gingrich believes.

9548,WOW! POPULAR IMAM WARNED NYC Mayor DeBlasio Of Terror Threats: “De Blasio spent all his energy and resources in trying to bring down President Trump and not Islamic Extremists”,"Imam Tawhidi is an outspoken voice in the Muslim community, who is unafraid to openly condemn Islamic extremists. After the terror attack today on the streets of New York City by a radical Muslim who was allegedly here on a  diversity visa , Imam Tawidi took off the gloves on Twitter and told the world that he warned Mayor DeBlasio, but was  Ignored! Tawhidi regularly tweets about the evils of extreme Islam:Extremists cannot force us into their paradise. In fact, I don t want to be in paradise if they re going to be there as well.  Imam Tawhidi (@Imamofpeace) October 31, 2017The Australian Imam is young, well presented and articulate. He is charming, has successfully utilized social media and has a strong following amongst the Australian public. Perhaps most importantly to a government that yearns for unity amongst its electorate, Tawhidi is an immigrant who champions the integration of fellow expats into the Australian community. The complete package, as it were.He isn t shy about calling out Islamic extremists and the people who suffer under Islamic extremist rule. Yesterday, Imam Tawhidi tweeted about his friend who was beaten to death by the Basij Militia of Iran over his anti-terrorist views:My friend Ali Yazdanshenas has passed away yesterday after being beaten to death by the Basij militia of Iran for his anti-terrorist views. pic.twitter.com/E04FJFcPyX  Imam Tawhidi (@Imamofpeace) October 30, 2017However, there is a barrier preventing Australian elites from supporting this maverick cleric, and that is that he does not follow the liberal narrative. Instead of simply condemning obscene teachings associated with his religion, Tawhidi demands modification. Rather than apologize for shortcomings within the immigrant community, the Imam has called for immediate action, encouraging a ban on Islamic schools and Islamist organizations like Hizb ut Tahrir. Through this, Tawhidi has even received the endorsement of none other than Ayaan Hirsi Ali   perhaps the most famous anti-Islamist (and Islamic) activist in the world   who has suggested that Tawhidi should be  elevated  to sit amongst and give counsel to politicians and leaders.Tawhidi is, therefore, one of those rare public figures: a reformer who not only denounces elements of Islam but actually seeks to restructure its teachings and interpretations. However, in the current global environment, the courage to promote such ideas inevitably leads to danger; the threat of violence is so present that Tawhidi has been forced to implement constant security measures in both his professional and private life.  The Spectator One might believe that a courageous person like Imam Tawhidi would be a valuable ally to America in their efforts to defeat radical Islam in the United States.  Based on the Imam s tweets, following the terror attack by a  diversity visa  holder in NYC, it appears that Mayor DeBlasio didn t find his warnings to be useful.Imam Tawhidi claims he personally sent letters to Mayor DeBlasio, and that he  did nothing. About #NYC terrorist attack, I personally sent letters to Mayor De Blasio online & in person about terrorist breeding in NYC.He did nothing.  Imam Tawhidi (@Imamofpeace) October 31, 2017Tawidi then tweeted that after warning DeBlasio about  hot radical centers  in NYC, he was  Ignored! In 2016, I told Mayor De Blasio that I was in NYC and noticed some hot radical centres. I was willing to point out serious cases. Ignored!  Imam Tawhidi (@Imamofpeace) October 31, 2017Imam Tawhidi explained that he s not some crackpot Imam trying to get attention, he actually holds a certificate in counter-terrorism.Not only am I a Muslim Imam who understands the threat of Islamic Extremism, I also hold a certificate in counter-terrorism. Now what!?  Imam Tawhidi (@Imamofpeace) October 31, 2017Tawhidi really blasted DeBlasio and all of the wasted energy he expends on trying to bring down President Trump and not Islamic Extremists.Fact: In the last two years, De Blasio spent all his energy and resources in trying to bring down President Trump and not Islamic Extremists  Imam Tawhidi (@Imamofpeace) October 31, 2017Imam Tawhidi went on to slam the Mayor DeBlasio of NYC and Mayor Sadiq Kahn of London who offered NYC his condolences after the terror attack:London stands in grief and solidarity with the great city of New York tonight. pic.twitter.com/ojrxSDnZos  Sadiq Khan (@SadiqKhan) October 31, 2017Here is Tawhidi s reply:De Blasio griefs about London and you grief about NYC. How about you both swap positions since you don t really care about your own people!? https://t.co/0yqTprAbdw  Imam Tawhidi (@Imamofpeace) October 31, 2017Spectator   It was during this overseas study, in 2014, that Tawhidi saw it as his duty to speak out against the questionable elements enshrined in his religion. On a sunny day in the Iraqi city of Karbala, Tawhidi was standing outside a mosque when, within earshot, a bomb exploded. As crowds ran from the scene and emergency crews rushed to help the survivors, the speakers of the mosque announced to the street below that Islamic State forces had invaded Mosul. If ever there was a time to speak out against Islamist terrorism, it was then.However, Tawhidi s campaigning has attracted many critics within the Islamic community itself. Calling for the closure of Islamic schools is bound to court controversy, but it is his contention that Islamic teachings are the causal link to Islamist terrorist acts that seems to really rile community leaders. Following the Manchester bombing, Tawhidi appeared in a fiery TV exchange with Dr. Jamal Rifi, imploring his fellow guest to acknowledge that the Islamic holy scripture  teach(es) the beheading of people .Perhaps Tawhidi is just the kind of person America, and the know-it-all liberals in European nations, who are being overrun by Islamic extremists posing as immigrants, need to be listening to, and perhaps next time, they might want to consider taking his warnings seriously ",politics,"Oct 31, 2017"

I believe this President has colluded with the Russians, with the Kremlin, with the oligarchs, perhaps, of Russia to undermine our election systems,  Waters told Capehart. (4:00) The California congresswoman also criticized the Senate investigation into Trump-Russia ties as not credible.  They re not moving fast enough!  she exclaimed. However, she praised the media for their investigations into Trump-Russia ties. (4:35) Waters described Attorney General Jeff Sessions as a  throwback to the days of Jim Crow,  equating Sessions with the era of segregation.  I think [Sessions] is a racist and I think he absolutely believes it s his job to keep minorities in their place.  She added that Sessions would like to go back to the days of segregation. (9:30   12:00)As evidence of Sessions  racism, Waters cited an instance where girls in traditional southern dresses greeted Trump and Sessions during the transition period. Waters  implication was that Sessions and Trump enjoyed the clothing because it reminded them of slavery. The group,  The Azalea Trail Maids,  wears colorful traditional dresses to events. (13:50)Capehart finally pushed her to find out if the U.S. government has seen evidence of collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign.  No, we have not,  Waters said. That means Waters has repeatedly called for Trump s impeachment without yet seeing any evidence of wrongdoing. (20:00)Our previous report on Maxine Waters said the Russia investigation has nothing on Trump:There is probably no one in Congress more openly opposed to President Donald Trump than Maxine Waters. We have already seen that she has called for Trump s impeachment. Therefore when even Waters states there is not yet any evidence at this time of Trump-Russia collusion, that is certainly significant. That is why it is astonishing that Washington Post opinion writer Jonathan Capehart left that significant admission made during his own podcast off his May 9 column about it.First let us listen to the segment of Capehart s podcast in which Waters made her surprising admission:How convenient for the left-leaning publication to leave out a direct statement by Maxine Waters. By the way, the title of the article is a rip roaring race baiting title:Maxine Waters: Jeff Sessions believes  it s his job to keep minorities in their place Who does this in 2017? Jeff Sessions is such a good man who DOES NOT deserve such a nasty comment from Congresswoman Waters. Shame on her and shame on Capehart for making this comment the title!JONATHAN CAPEHART: I ve got to ask you, because you leveled a whole lot of accusations out there about collusions and hacking and all of that. Have you seen anything, either through the intelligence briefings, anything to back up any of the accusations that you ve made?MAXINE WATERS: First of all, don t forget that all of our intelligence agencies say, yes, they have the documentation that they did the hacking on the DNC and on some of us.CAPEHART: But the collusion, though?WATERS: No, we have not. That s why investigations are so important, to drill down and to connect those dots and to get the facts. What we have is a lot of smoke that causes us to want to know more about what has happened. Why is it there are so many people around him are connected to oil? Why is it that Michael Flynn, who evidently has a great relationship with Putin, who has received payments for so-called speeches and who s spent a lot of time in Russia and was accused of talking about sanctions, he lied about it and he got caught?In his column writeup about his podcast interview with Maxine Waters, Capehart tossed that admission of no evidence of Trump-Russia collusion down the memory hole.Via: NTK",politics,"May 10, 2017"
7452, How The GOP Plans To Steal The Election From The American People — And Hand It To Romney,"Mitt Romney watched his dream of becoming president fly right out the window in 2012 when he made the infamous  47 percent of Americans are looking for a handout  speech at a private fundraiser that was secretly recorded and released to the public. Romney alienated himself from half the American population in one fell swoop, handing an electoral landslide to President Obama. He re-surfaced in 2015 with a quick stint pre-campaign test, only to decide he wouldn t run again.in late January of this year, however, Mittens made sure his FEC paperwork was in order to be listed as a candidate for the election. While most presume he did what he had to to secure a spot on the ballot in case he gets nominated at a brokered GOP convention, there could be far more ominous issues with Mitt Romney and his political future.The Republican party is in a panic. Donald Trump is looking like he will be able to secure the nomination with more than 50 percent of the delegates, making a brokered convention an impossibility. Trump would at that point be the Republican nominee for president this November, which would fracture the GOP into an unrecognizable shadow of its former self. So what would the plan be at that point? To steal the election from under the noses of the American people and hand it to his own running mate, Paul Ryan, to decide with a vote in the House of Representatives.It s not really that complicated, either. According to the 12th Amendment, if no candidate reaches the number of electoral votes necessary to secure the presidency, a ballot will be cast by the House to decide the victor. If the GOP runs Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan against their own candidate as a third party choice, chances are that outcome could come to pass. The morons lining up to vote for Trump aren t the typical party base. While he has the fringe vote locked up, as well as the independent low-information voter, he ll never take the Koch-loving regulars away. Those people would rather vote for Hillary Clinton and take their chances on 2020 than watch Trump destroy their party and our country.So then, in an all-out battle between Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton and Mitt Romney, all the Republicans have to do is squeeze out enough votes from two candidates to keep Clinton under the 270 electoral votes needed to be elected. While that scenario seems crazy and unlikely, it has happened before. With enough voter obstruction and cleverly played lawsuits, we could witness a travesty that would give the Republicans control of all three branches of government, effectively destroying our country as we know it.Republicans are no good at winning elections fair and square. If they had to rely on the people to elect them, they would have died 20 years ago. People think they are refusing to consider a Supreme Court justice just because Obama is the nominating president. While that may be partially true, it also plays into the strategy of giving the vote to the House. If the Republicans contest enough results in blue states where conservative judges sit on federal benches, appeals to SCOTUS would end in 4-4 ties, leaving the lower court rulings in effect.The whole thing is an archaic constitutional mess that should have been addressed and done away with decades ago, but alas, it s here for this election cycle and it could jump up and bite our country where the sun refuses to shine.Featured image by Gage Skidmore",News,"March 17, 2016"
2311, Internet Heroes Make Trump-Putin Facebook Friendship Anniversary Video; It’s BRILLIANT (VIDEO),"The internet is full of hidden gems, and this hostile political environment and corrupt Trump administration has given us some of the most hilarious, powerful memes and videos we ve seen in a while. The latest masterpiece to grace the internet was inspired by the friendship anniversary videos we ve been seeing on everyone s Facebook feed   the ones that celebrates close friendships with a highlight reel of all the time you ve spent connecting on Facebook.Well, two geniuses   filmmakers Evan and Adam Nix   have given us something truly amazing with a new friendship anniversary video   of Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin. Poking fun at their disturbingly close and suspicious relationship, the Nix brothers got super creative and took a lighthearted approach to a concerning issue that most of America is extremely worried about. This video was released right as Trump is facing new criticism for his praise and defense of Russia, and his relationship with Putin and Russia has been called the biggest scandal in recent months.The Nix Bros. hilariously start the friendship anniversary out by stating  A few months ago today you rigged the election together The video goes through several pinnacle points of Trump and Putin s weird connection, even once striking a sentimental tone in their friendship: And while there are several dictatorships, there s only one like yours ;) That s terrifying! At the very end, the video closes with a statement almost every American   even conservatives   know to be true: We are all totally fucked. You can watch the film below: The short film is absolutely genius, and worth every second. The Nix Bros. are known for their funny political videos, and we re so happy they weighed in on Trump and Putin with their satirical brand of comedy.

Not because Trump has something to hide, but to  protect the public. Conway appeared on Fox and Friends Sunday morning and when she was asked about FBI Director James Comey, she spun the conversation around to whine that  classified  information should not be handed out to the public. In other words, she s upset the world found out about Trump s Russian pee pee party. I m always disappointed how public and sometimes political some of these figures can seem to be,  Conway said.  I m very concerned, very concerned. You realize it is the Trump team, only us at this time, that is not divulging what occurred in a classified briefing. Ladies and gentlemen,  she continued.  It s called a classified briefing for a reason. You had the vice president of the United States making a comment about it the other day. You have intelligence officials confirming or denying. This classified information, it s top secret. Why is it top secret? It s not top secret to keep it from the public, but to protect the public. That s right folks, you shouldn t know anything about Trump s Russian escapades. The American people should be kept totally in the dark about the foreign government meddling in the highest levels of our democracy. And it s for your own good, dammit!Conway then added that Trump is  going to do all the things he promised to do,  including building his stupid wall and snatching health care away from millions of Americans.Watch Conway insist we should keep Trump s pee party top secret to  protect the public,  here: Featured image via video screen capture",News,"January 15, 2017"

126," Fox News Just Completed Transformation Into Safe Space For Fragile, Snowflakey Donald Trump","Fox News has decided to cancel certain ads on their network, completing their transition from a conservative network into a safe space for their fragile Trump fans, and after Trump himself threw a livid fit. A series of ads by political activist Tom Steyer, which call for Trump s impeachment, has been pulled because of the reaction to it from their viewers. Seriously: Due to the strong negative reaction to their ad by our viewers, we could not in good conscience take their money. Why, because their viewers will abandon the network if they show any signs of trying to be balanced? Of course, Fox News is a private entity and is allowed to do this, but the question remains: Is it censorship if they did so because of pressure from Trump? The unhinged presidential impostor did go on Twitter to call Steyer  wacky & totally unhinged  when the  Impeach Trump  campaign was first launched in late October. That may well have put pressure on Fox to pull it.Wacky & totally unhinged Tom Steyer, who has been fighting me and my Make America Great Again agenda from beginning, never wins elections!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 27, 2017Fake President Trump is known for his attacks on the  fake news  media, and it s entirely possible that Fox News is terrified of him. Or, at the very least, terrified that he ll stop coming for ridiculously easy and softball interviews from friendly neighborhood conspiracy theorists like Sean Hannity.Steyer, for his part, is claiming that Fox is in breach of contract over this. His lawyer, Brad Deutsch, said that, on Oct. 27, Fox had agreed unconditionally to air the ads for one more week. Canceling the ads when they did  signaled a profound failure of journalistic integrity, a suppression of constitutionally protected speech, and likely a consequence of inexcusable political pressure.

4998, WATCH: Fox Hosts Claim Hillary Has Brain Damage Because She Wears Eyeglasses,"Fox News is desperate to sabotage Hillary Clinton s campaign so they are continuing to launch outrageous lies about her health.Last week, Sean Hannity pushed an absurd claim that Hillary suffered a seizure on camera because she playfully acted like a bobble head doll while being pulled in different directions by different speakers. When the joke was over she then spoke and smiled, two things that people definitely do not do while having a seizure.As Newsweek s Kurt Eichenwald explained to Hannity earlier this week, People do not smile during a seizure while standing upright and then immediately launch into a coherent sentence. There s no smiling because, if for some reason the person experiencing the seizure has not collapsed to the ground in unconsciousness, the moment the body begins to move uncontrollably is terrifying. After a seizure, someone does not instantly jump back into a conversation, making jokes. Eichenwald should know. He has epilepsy.But Fox & Friends has picked up where Hannity left off and made a brand new claim on Thursday in an effort to cast doubt on the health of Hillary s mind.Steve Doocy, who was named in Gretchen Carlson s sexual harassment lawsuit against Roger Ailes, suggested that Hillary Clinton has brain damage because she wears prism eyeglasses. Is that the fact that when we saw Hillary Clinton wearing those prism glasses, a sign of brain damage and other things, and he s worried about the care she s getting so far,  Doocy said in reference to Dr. Drew Pinsky allegedly expressing concern for Hillary s health.Kilmeade then suggested that Clinton s glasses are connected to Benghazi, because conservatives will never stop talking about that. And if you want to   or remember, when she was wearing those glasses, remember when she made those famous line to Senator Ron Johnson,  What difference at this point does it make,  that s when she had those glasses on. Here s the video via Media Matters.This kind of speculation is why Fox should drop the  News  part of their name.Just because Hillary Clinton is wearing prism glasses it does not mean that she has brain damage. It means she has eye problems like 75 percent of Americans do.Hillary wears Fresnel prism glasses to correct double vision resulting from a concussion she sustained in 2012 after she fainted and fell due to dehydration.This in no way disqualifies her from being president. She merely has a vision issue that needs correcting.And if wearing glasses is a sign of brain damage perhaps Fox should have performed a quick search on Google for Donald Trump. Because they would have found this.So does that mean Trump has brain damage? I mean, that would definitely explain Trump s crazy behavior over the last year.Featured image via Twitter",News,"August 18, 2016"

5200," GOP Billionaire Meg Whitman Endorses Hillary Clinton, Trashes Trump","Another day, another billionaire and/or Republican refuses to endorse the train wreck that is Donald J. Trump. While a slew of influential Republicans   elected or not   have rescinded or flat out refused to endorse the GOP presidential nominee, others have stubbornly remained by his side even after being stabbed in the back.But as Trump continues to say any outrageous, offensive and grotesque thing that comes to mind, one influential mega donor in the party is saying  enough  and is endorsing Trump s rival, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton instead. And her endorsement of Clinton isn t a  I guess I m with her  mentality, either   it s a full blown  Ready for Hillary  sentiment.Meg Whitman, a self made billionaire who didn t have any help from her daddy, posted a stinging denouncement of Trump on her Facebook. Earlier this year, during the primary, Whitman expressed concern that Trump s rhetoric would hurt the party and turn off the electorate.  It turns out she was right, as Hillary Clinton has taken the lead (for now) by margins of 7 points to 15 points nationally.Whitman referred to Trump as  uninformed,   unsteady,   authoritarian,  and a  demogauge.  She also praised Clinton for being an experienced, level-headed leader:As a proud Republican, casting my vote for President has usually been a simple matter. This year is different. To vote Republican out of party loyalty alone would be to endorse a candidacy that I believe has exploited anger, grievance, xenophobia and racial division. Donald Trump s demagoguery has undermined the fabric of our national character.Trump s reckless and uninformed positions on critical issues   from immigration to our economy to foreign policy   have made it abun dantly clear that he lacks both the policy depth and sound judgment required as President. Trump s unsteady hand would endanger our prosperity and national security. His authoritarian character could threaten much more.Therefore, I have decided to support Hillary Rodham Clinton. It is clear to me that Secretary Clinton s temperament, global experience and commitment to America s bedrock national values make her the far better choice in 2016 for President of the United States. In a tumultuous world, America needs the kind of stable and aspirational leadership Secretary Clinton can provide. I urge all Republicans to reject Donald Trump this November.Whitman, who is seen as a more moderate Republican given her positions of abortion, gay marriage and immigration, did the unthinkable: she put country over party. And for that Republicans are already denouncing her like they did Romney, Kasich, Christie Todd Whitman, and so forth.This also shouldn t come as a huge surprise. Whitman has donated to and aligned herself with California senator Barbara Boxer, considered one of the most liberal members of the Senate.Good for Meg Whitman in denouncing Trump and doing what is right.

15497,BREAKING: GUN USED BY 5 TIME DEPORTED ILLEGAL ALIEN BELONGED TO FEDERAL AGENT,"Just another interesting discovery in a story that has already exposed a very corrupt government that favors illegal aliens over American citizens The gun used in the seemingly random slaying of a woman on a San Francisco pier belonged to a federal agent, a law enforcement official briefed on the matter said Tuesday.The official, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the case and spoke on condition of anonymity, said a police check of the weapon s serial number shows it belonged to a federal agent. The official declined to elaborate further.The San Francisco Police Department, which is investigating the case, declined to comment.The revelation was the latest dramatic twist in a tragic case that has become a new flashpoint in the country s debate over immigration policies.The suspected gunman, Juan Francisco Lopez Sanchez, has been deported to his native Mexico five times and is suspected of living in the United States illegally when Kathryn Steinle, 32, was gunned down last week while on an evening stroll with her father along San Francisco s popular waterfront area.Federal officials transferred Sanchez to San Francisco s jail in March to face a 20-year-old marijuana charge after Sanchez completed his latest prison term for illegally entering the country.The San Francisco sheriff, citing the city s  sanctuary city  policy, released Sanchez in April after prosecutors dropped the drug charge, despite an Immigration and Customs Enforcement request to hold him for federal authorities so deportation proceedings could begin.Sanchez pleaded not guilty Tuesday to first-degree murder.He told two television stations who interviewed him in jail that he found the gun used in Steinle s killing wrapped in a shirt on the pedestrian pier she was walking on. Sanchez said the gun went off in his hands, and his public defender, Matt Gonzalez, said Tuesday that the San Francisco woman s death appeared accidental. San Francisco Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi has defended Sanchez s release and the city law requiring it to ignore ICE detainer requests. The sheriff said ICE could have obtained a warrant or court order to keep Sanchez in custody. ICE knew where he was,  Mirkarimi said Monday. He said he will continue to ignore ICE detainer requests.State and federal Republicans, meanwhile, said they would look into the matter.Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, who chairs the Senate s homeland security committee, criticized federal officials and demanded to know why Sanchez was not deported. Does that make any sense to you?  Johnson demanded to know at a hearing Tuesday.  Because I ll tell you it doesn t make any sense to the American public. Republican state Sen. Jeff Stone said he would introduce legislation in Sacramento to require cities to comply with ICE detainer requests.At Sanchez s arraignment Tuesday, prosecutor Dianna Garcia argued against releasing Sanchez on bail, saying,  This was an act of random violence, shooting an innocent victim in the back. The judge set bail at $5 million, which Gonzalez said will keep Sanchez jailed pending trial.A downcast Sanchez spent most of the hearing with his head bowed, appearing to fight back tears while the judge explained the charged to him. Sanchez was aided by a Spanish-language interpreter and entered his plea in Spanish.Outside court, his attorney said Sanchez has a second-grade education and a non-violent criminal record.He could face life in prison if convicted.Via: FOX Carolina",politics,"Jul 8, 2015"
4588, WATCH: This Democrat Just Released The Most Badass Campaign Ad So Far,"Jason Kander is a Democrat running for a United States Senate seat in Missouri. The seat is currently held by Roy Blunt, a Republican. Kander, who is 35-years-old and is also Missouri s current attorney general, recently released probably the best political advertisement we will see in the 2016 election.Kander s opponent has been attacking him for supporting more effective background checks on gun sales.That was a major mistake for Blunt. That s because Kander is an Afghanistan war veteran. Which means that he knows his way around firearms, which Kander demonstrates perfectly in his campaign video. The thirty-second advertisement busts a myth that the right-wing has made about gun-law-reformers for decades   that enacting smart safety regulations is tantamount to unilateral gun confiscation.In reality, despite what the NRA would have people think, gun law reformers want to create laws that should be considered common sense. Such as say, not letting people on terrorist watch lists purchase firearms.In the ad, Kander stands in front of a table with a dissembled rifle on the table. Kander proceeds to assemble the weapon while blindfolded. While Kander assembles the rifle he says: I m Jason Kander and Senator Blunt has been attacking me on guns. Well, in the army I learned how to use and respect my rifle. In Afghanistan, I volunteered to be a gun in an unarmored convoy of SUV s. In the state legislature, I supported 2nd amendment rights. I also believe in background checks so that terrorists can t get their hands on one of these. When Kander finishes assembling the rifle, he removes his blindfold and says,  I approve this message because I d like to see Senator Blunt do this. A majority of Americans are in favor of expanding background checks. Yet, Congress has not taken action to support legislation that would create such a system. That s because the NRA is holding our Congress hostage. They donate huge amounts of moneyto political candidates. In 2016, so far the NRA has spent $825,000 dollars in campaign contributions. A paltry sum compared to the total amounts of money they have spent influencing politics. Overall, they have spent more than a quarter million dollars supporting Blunt.They also work endlessly to brainwash their supporters into thinking that all gun-reformers want to get rid of the second amendment. Which is absolutely not true.

13228,MASS MIGRATION OR INFRASTRUCTURE…CHOOSE ONE: ONE MILLION Imported Every Year While Our Nation Crumbles!,"The truth in the information below is so dead on! We re putting foreigners before Americans by brining in over 1 million every year! Did you know that we have a diversity lottery every year where we allow 50 thousand people to come to the US for no other reason than diversity. We CANNOT keep doing this! Something has to give in our government s effort to flood us with third worlders Here s the story of just one city in America that s the result of mass migration:Anticipating strong population growth, Seattle s urban planners long ago built an impressive 5-lane highway through the city, a 2-lane by-way for the east side and a 3-lane freeway on the west side. Seattle s infrastructure was built to host a growing economic hub and it was built to last. So how is it Seattle today has the worst traffic in America?Infrastructure spending has doubled since the 1990s, yet every election focuses on an infrastructure crisis.In Seattle, many point to new employees of Microsoft and Amazon. Sure, those have an effect. But the real problem is immigration. 14% of Washington is foreign born. How can we ever expect to build sustainable and safe infrastructure when we allow a million people each year to move here?Liberals love infrastructure spending. They believe it stimulates the economy through spending and expands overall economic output, like a well-greased machine. In 2009, President Obama was given $900 billion to rebuild America s infrastructure for the 21st century. Yet, 7 years later, here we are again with Democrats calling for trillion dollar infrastructure packages as if it will once and for all fix our crumbling, overcrowded infrastructure.Liberals long for a distant past of mass immigration leading to economic greatness. They treat America as if it is still a vast, unpopulated frontier where the only infrastructure needed by horse-driven wagon trains is a decent map.A key pillar in Hillary Clinton s infrastructure plan is  Lower transportation costs and unlock economic opportunity by expanding public transit option. Hillary will encourage local governments to work with low-income communities to ensure unemployed and underemployed Americans are connected to good job.  A fine objective. We should provide mass transit options to low income areas, but how can we ever have a satisfactory metro system when low income areas are multiplying in population and area because we invite millions of unemployed, uneducated immigrants? This is yet another example of taking care of foreigners before Americans.Fearing accusations of racism, nobody wants to admit that foreigners are not good drivers. They come from places where traffic laws are ignored, and they bring that culture with them. Native Seattleites are good, safe drivers who don t break 5 miles over the speed limit and are far too passive aggressive to honk. This isn t a genetic or race issue, it s a cultural issue and the culture almost everywhere outside America is indifferent to extremely aggressive, stupid driving. Just watch the daily Russia s Funniest Dashcam Videos capturing vodka-fueled Fast & Furious driving stunts in heavy traffic.Infrastructure is more than just roads. Think of all the waterways, electrical grids, and internet fibers laid just to keep pace with immigration. That s billions of dollars that could have been spent upgrading existing systems and preventing tragedies like the Flint, Michigan leaded water.Unchecked immigration has skyrocketed water prices, utilities companies can barely maintain consistent service, and there is a housing shortage crisis. And Seattle liberals are completely dumbfounded by these problems. The mayor regularly holds press conferences and the city council organizes investigative committees, but never do they admit the problem is out of control immigration and Seattle s sanctuary city policy.Seattle suburbs once had a great style to them. Houses were unique and in harmony with the very green Seattle geography. Now, all of Seattle is being overrun by soulless, cubist condominium buildings to maximize the use of our extremely limited real estate. Building your own house with a fence and a lawn is no longer part of the American dream in Seattle.Schools also suffer. Seattle has a less than 2 child per couple birthrate, yet our schools are stuffed to the gills with children. Decades ago, Seattle built an excellent system of schools. Tax payers built a system for their children, and now they re being ordered to build a bigger system for the children of Indonesia and Cambodia. Rather than evolving teaching systems, our education energy is spent figuring out how to teach in a school where students speak 18 languages and are offended by the American flag. Teachers are no longer employed for their deep knowledge of pedagogy, but by whether she speaks Spanish or Swahili.Our parks have been completely taken over by immigrants. The ballfield where I learned to field grounders is controlled every day by soccer-playing Somalis. People afraid to schedule their games or practices there because there is always confrontation with people from the country that dragged through the streets of Mogadishu the dead naked bodies of our special forces soldiers trying to give them food.Liberals claim how great immigrants are because they pay taxes. Great, thanks for helping to pay for new infrastructure we need because you came here in waves demanding we upgrade so your daily commute to the Home Depot parking lot isn t slowed down.Sure, some immigrants do pay taxes to help partially cover the cost of new schools need to educate their illiterate children, the roads and buses to shuttle them to and fro, and the anti-gang police task forces needed to monitor their older brothers in ethnic gangs. To liberals, the population of America exists to serve the government rather than our society existing on its own with government to help out here and there, so immigration is inherently good.The choice for America is either mass immigration or a sustainable, healthy infrastructure, not both.Via: Regated",politics,"Aug 17, 2016"
22580,False Flag Florida: FBI Agents ‘Posing As Terrorists’ in Miami Sting Operation,"21st Century Wire says The FBI is walking a very fine line that crosses into the unacceptable.Watch a video of this report here:The FBI has apparently arrested a man planning an attack on a Miami-area synagogue with an explosive device.The suspect had allegedly planned to attack the Aventura Turnberry Jewish Center on Friday evening.The plot, which is about as simple as they come, involved throwing an explosive device over a wall and into the synagogue grounds during Friday night services, as congregants would have been marking the start of Shabbat and the final day of Passover.Most importantly, the synagogue was never actually in any real danger.This is because, the man  was stopped by FBI agents posing as fellow terrorists who set up a sting operation. The bomb, apparently a dummy, was  sold to him in Hallandale Beach by an FBI undercover operative just before the planned terror attack .What this means, is that the suspect James Medina, may have never had the material means to carry out any attack with an explosive device unless it had been provided by the FBI.So why is anybody praising the FBI for stopping a terror attack when they are the very group that facilitated its implementation in the first place?The synagogue s Facebook page issued a statement saying the FBI had even told them that,  there are no credible threats directed against us at the present time. No credible threats  means that the only threat was a fictitious false flag created by the FBI.Democratic Party National Committee head and Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, apparently unaware of the finer details, said she was,  deeply grateful that the FBI arrested this individual before he was allegedly able to do harm to the Aventura Turnberry Jewish Center .Where do we draw the line between  posing as a terrorist , and actually being a terrorist?How can the FBI be allowed to facilitate such incidents and then claim credit, both financially and politically, for stopping them?ALL THE FALSE FLAG INFO YOU NEED: 21st Century Wire False Flag Files",US_News,"May 3, 2016"
7602," Trump’s Using This Shady, Sneaky Tactic To Throw Protesters Out Of His Rallies (VIDEO)","Donald Trump s campaign has hit a new low   as if it could get any worse. According to a Politico report released on Tuesday, the current Republican front-runner has found a new way to ensure that protesters are mistreated during his rallies   by using security officers in street clothes so they never see it coming.This new rally tactic was put into action during a Friday rally in New Orleans, where several plainclothes security officers were seen working. Eddie Deck, one of these officers, said that he was told to do intelligence work researching possible protesters as well as assist any security officers in uniform. According to the report, Black Lives Matter protesters were escorted out of the same rally by these security officers disguised in civilian s clothing.Hope Hicks, Trump s campaign spokeswoman, has not responded to Politico s request for comment.This new initiative by the campaign makes Trump s already violent rallies even more dangerous   especially for minority groups, which have been routinely targeted. Black Lives Matter and pro-immigrant groups show up at Trump s events often to oppose his offensive anti-minority stances, and are usually forcibly removed even in instances when they re being completely peaceful. In many instances, an attack on a protester has been racially motivated. There have also been times that Trump has actually encouraged violence or egged on his protesters, telling them that he will pay any legal fees or consequences that come of their attacks.// < ![CDATA[ <span class=""mceItemHidden"" data-mce-bogus=""1""><span></span>(function(d, s, id) {  var js, <span class=""mceItemHidden"" data-mce-bogus=""1""><span class=""hiddenSpellError"" pre="""" data-mce-bogus=""1"">fjs</span></span> = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&amp;version=v2.3"";  <span class=""hiddenSpellError"" pre="""" data-mce-bogus=""1"">fjs</span>.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', '<span class=""hiddenSpellError"" pre="""" data-mce-bogus=""1"">facebook-jssdk</span>')); // ]]&gt;I m watching this shit right now on the news 2016 in Louisville KY and I m furious !!!!look at the way they treated this beautiful African American female these racist ### ######## turned the tables and you know what would happen this is what these people think about usPosted by Paul Bibbs on Tuesday, March 1, 2016But it s not just minorities that are in danger   it s basically anyone that Trump feels threatened by, and you don t have to be a protester to make Trump feel insecure. It turns out, the press makes the front runner really nervous, too. Just last week, TIME magazine photojournalist Christopher Morris was brutally choke-slammed to the ground by one of Trump s secret service agents at a Virginia rally.New video shows Secret Service agent brutally choke slamming a photographer at Trump rally https://t.co/OkvQdWfH8r pic.twitter.com/G6dArHxoKE  Mashable (@mashable) February 29, 2016And last night, Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields was grabbed by the arm and thrown to the ground by Trump s own campaign manager during a press event.In most cases of horrific violence, the protesters and the press are either simply doing their jobs or being completely peaceful   but they are still attacked, manhandled and thrown out. Everyone that works with or around Trump is extremely dangerous and cannot be trusted   and he keeps proving that again and again. No one is safe at one of Trump s events, and now his concealed security officers will only make sure that people aren t able to see the danger before it s too late.Featured image via Gage Skidmore",News,"March 9, 2016"
15515,"GAY VOTERS AND #BlackLivesMatter TO OBAMA, But Kids With Cancer…Not So Much","There s no need for Barack Obama and Valerie Jarrett to make a statement about finding a cure for pediatric cancer, which receives 4 percent of The National Cancer Institute s $4.6 billion budget. There s no need because working together to help fund a cure for cancer doesn t divide a nation, and we all know kids can t vote Picture is from Rockstar Ronan, a website dedicated to lighting the White House gold!Quite some time ago, a petition was circulated to  Light the White House Gold.  The ask was simple: Come September 1, or the beginning of Childhood Cancer Awareness Month, put some gold lightbulbs in the spotlights out front of the White House and tell the childhood cancer community and all the kids fighting and dying of cancer that they matter.The president, through Paulette Aniskoff, Deputy Assistant to the President and Director of the Office of Public Engagement, dropped the news that there would be no gold lights. There was a recycled proclamation, though, so maybe we should be happy for this small token. Of course, most of you will recall that last year on October 1, a giant pink ribbon and pink lightbulbs were festooned quickly on the White House. Should the White House go  pink  again in a month, it will be a significant slap in the face to the childhood cancer community. Yet another gesture of inequality for our kids.Cancer remains the number one disease killer of children. Cancer kills more kids in this country than AIDS, cystic fibrosis and muscular dystrophy combined. So, when the long awaited response came from the president, you can understand why it was quite disappointing.Cancer kills more than 2,500 children in our country every year. Over 13,500 kids will be diagnosed with cancer in the next 365 days. Though these numbers are significant, the potential market is too small to attract the attention of private industry. This makes the role of the taxpayer-funded National Cancer Institute (NCI) especially critical yet approximately 4% percent of its annual budget is dedicated to childhood cancer. The result is that children are dying every day waiting for promising new treatments that lack funding. This puts an extra burden on families with a child battling cancer.Of course, lighting the White House gold would not cure any children or provide additional research funding. But that is not the point. I would gladly choose additional funding in the federal budget over a handful of gold lightbulbs. Again, that is not the point. Childhood cancer advocates fight so hard for every ounce of awareness in an effort to translate it into additional funding. What better symbol to raise the ultimate amount of awareness than the most powerful residence on the face of the earth? At the present time, a paltry 4 percent of the total National Cancer Institute Budget (NCI) is dedicated to all forms of childhood cancer. Thank you, Harold Varmus, M.D. That brings me back to the small little ask that apparently is only reserved for the ubiquitous pink ribbon.What is the message here to the childhood cancer community? Kids with cancer do not matter as much as breast cancer? If kids with cancer do not merit more than 4 percent of the federal research budget, and childhood cancer is not important enough to garner the simple gesture of a handful of gold lightbulbs, then what is our position? I wish I had the answer to that question. I hope that it does not mean that children with cancer do not merit the same simple gestures and considerations as breast cancer. It certainly appears that way though.According to the news of Take Part, White House led the celebration by lighting up rainbow-colored lights. President Obama cited a statement which was quoted by takepart.com. He said,  When all Americans are treated as equal, we were all more free, this ruling is a victory for America.  President Obama had long been supporting marriage equality since 2012.Niagara Falls was one of the several US landmarks that lip up rainbow-colored lights for supporting same-sex marriage.Cinderella Castle in Disney World also took part of the celebration. According to Take Part, in Florida, same-sex marriage was illegal but on Friday, people and the Disney World partied as they have heard the decision, the Cinderella Castle became more enchanting with its rainbow-colored lights as they celebrated marriage equality.The St. Louis Civil Courts Building also lit up with flying rainbow colors. Alderman Shane Cohn spent $15,000 in capital for the improvement funds of the rainbow lights in the Civil Courts Building in St. Louis. Several downtown buildings as well lit up rainbow-colored lights as a sign of support for the gay rights and St. Louis  PrideFest. accrding to the report of stltoday.com, St. Louis recently was called the  gayest cities in America. Other famous landmarks which supported the same-sex marriage and brighten up with rainbow colors were Terminal Tower in Cleveland, The Empire State Building (In September 2014, the Empire State Building received national backlash for their decision not to go gold for Childhood Cancer Awareness Month.)Penn Station in New York City, The Seattle Great Wheel, The Alamo in San Antonio, in San Francisco, three of their monuments have participated, including: San Francisco City Hall, San Francisco International Airport and Grace Cathedral, the Playhouse Square in Cleveland, The Davis Building in Dallas, The U.S. Grant Hotel in San Diego also participated in the celebration.Ultimately, a handful of lightbulbs and a giant gold ribbon will not find better treatments or cures for the difficult cancers that kill so many children. It will not force Harold Varmus, M.D., to change his funding allocations. And, it may not cause more people to donate money toward childhood cancer research. All may be true. What that handful of lightbulbs and fabric may do is provide an additional measure of hope. And never should we forget that hope is a dangerous commodity, especially to a community that sometimes finds itself without any. Thanks for nothing, Mr. President.

13484,"LOL! ACTRESS CHARLIE THERON Tells South Africans AIDS Is “Not transmitted by SEX…“It’s transmitted by sexism, racism, poverty and homophobia” [VIDEO]","Is there really anything more irresponsible than standing before a large group of people on a stage in South Africa and telling them that SEX doesn t transmit AIDS? As long as Theron s a card carrying Hollywood liberal, she gets a pass and anything she says. After all, her reckless remarks were only for the good of the poor blacks in Africa right?The HIV virus can be spread in plenty more ways than just sex, actress Charlize Theron asserted while delivering the opening remarks at the 21st International AIDS Conference in Durban, South Africa on Monday. It  is not just AIDS,  she said.  It is the culture that condones rape and shames victims into silence.  It  is the cycle of poverty and violence that traps girls into teen marriages and forces them to sell their bodies to provide for their families.  It  is the racism that allows the white and the wealthy to exploit the black and the poor and then blame them for their own suffering.  It  is the homophobia that shames and isolates LGBT youth and keeps them from life-saving healthcare and education. HIV is not just transmitted by sex,  Theron added.  It s transmitted by sexism, racism, poverty and homophobia. And if we re going to end AIDS, we have to cure the disease within our own hearts and within our own minds first.  -BreitbartThis certainly isn t the first time the rabid anti-gun actress has made the news (well almost) for making a completely unfounded  and idiotic comment. In May, 2014, Theron compared the media s coverage of her to  rape . When asked by Sky News whether she ever Googled herself, Theron replied,  I don t do that, so that s my saving grace. When you start living in that world, and doing that, you start, I guess, feeling raped. Critics went wild over her twisted analogy. But in the end, she s a Hollywood liberal and much like their good friend in the White House, they re untouchable. The sky is the limit when it comes to the ignorant and irresponsible statements they are able to make without ever being held accountable. ",politics,"Jul 19, 2016"
5964, GOP’s Attempt At Voter Suppression In Ohio Is Struck Down In Court,"Fearing that the 2016 presidential election will be a disaster   with Hillary Clinton and Senate Democrats looking pretty favorable   Republicans have, of course, have been working overtime to suppress the vote in a key battleground state: Ohio.As everyone knows, no person elected president has ever won without winning Ohio. Even though Clinton wouldn t need Ohio (as long as she nabs Virginia, North Carolina and Florida) to win, that hasn t stopped Republicans from already attempting to rig the election.However, their hopes of doing just that were destroyed in court, when a federal judge issued a ruling that the state s new laws restricting the collection and counting of absentee ballots and poll workers aiding voters were unconstitutional on racial grounds. Judge Algenon Marble wrote in his decision:Voter suppression tactics have not disappeared but are now merely cloaked in ostensibly race-neutral language.Judge Marble also noted that the state s decision to bar poll workers from helping minorities fill out ballots unless the voter affirmed that he or she was disabled or illiterate was in violation of the Constitution, for it established a  literacy test  on those seeking to vote:The Court agrees with Dr. Timberlake that these inequalities, rooted in historical discrimination against African-Americans, have  significant and far-reaching  effects with specific and direct consequences for voting. Because low literacy levels are also correlated with substandard education and the Court has credited Dr. Timberlake s findings that African-Americans suffer from lower educational attainment than whites in Ohio, the Court concludes that African-Americans would also suffer from higher costs associated with the five-field requirement and the prohibition on poll-worker assistance because they would face disproportionately more challenges filling out the forms.  Because African-Americans move more frequently than whites, they may be more likely to be forced to vote provisionally. They are also more likely to be homeless.  And because they are more likely to have inflexible schedules or lack access.In other words: the state of Ohio, which is run by Republicans, attempted to circumvent black voters by instilling on them an option: know how to spell or your vote doesn t matter.Republicans literally just tried to turn black people away from voting   in 2016.This is what Republicans do: they disenfranchise black voters because they know their days of white rule are coming to and end.Featured image via Andrew Burton/Getty Images",News,"June 8, 2016"
14461,WHY WOULD OBAMA ALLOW GREEN BERET To Be Discharged For Saving Life Of Young Boy Kept As Sex Slave By Muslim Afghan Police Chief?,"It s hard to read stories like this without wondering how a Commander in Chief can so easily desert those who sacrifice all for our nation, in favor of looking the other way when it comes to twisted Islamic traditions . De Oppresso Liber  (To Liberate the Oppressed) ~~Motto of the U.S. Army Special ForcesA poignant Afghan proverb declares,  Cowards cause harm to brave men. This ancient Pashtun adage reflects the shocking story of U.S. Special Forces Sgt. Charles Martland; Martland is the brave man, a soldier who saved the life of an Afghan boy who was abducted, held, and abused as a sex slave by an Afghan police chief, Abdul Rahman, the vicious, powerful, and arrogant coward. The incomprehensible harm to Martland resides in the inexplicable action taken by the U.S. Army. The Army disciplined Martland, relieved him from his duty post in Afghanistan, and is now seeking to involuntarily discharge him from military service.What was the dreadful and dischargeable infraction by the highly decorated Green Beret Charles Martland? Quinn was relieved of his Special Forces command after a fight with a U.S.-backed militia leader who had a boy as a sex slave chained to his bed. Credit Kirsten Luce For NYTIn 2011, Martland and his Special Forces Captain Dan Quinn (who has since resigned from the military) physically assaulted Abdul Rahman, after learning that Rahman had abducted a boy, chained him to a bed, repeatedly abused him as a sex slave and beat up the boy s mother when she sought to find and rescue her son. The Green Berets intervened when they discovered that the boy was being raped and held as a sex slave. According to the Martland and Quinn, the Afghan villagers were pleading with them to do something about repeated sexual assaults against children by the Afghan police.Here is the dirty, not so little secret of Afghanistan: The sexual abuse of children is widespread and embedded into the Afghan Pashtun culture. There is scant prosecution of child sex exploitation in Afghanistan. American military have long been saddled with the knowledge of the Afghan practice of  bacha bazi,  translated as dancing boys. Bacha Bazi is the ancient and widespread practice of Afghan men who abduct and lure poor boys into the grisly world of child sex slavery where they are raped and exploited by Afghan men. Frontline exposed this lurid child sex trafficking trade.U.S. Military stationed in Afghanistan experience the hideous reality that children are expendable in the feckless Afghan criminal justice system. Cultural mores trump human rights among the tribesman of Afghanistan.This wasn t the first time that Martland and Quinn experienced inaction from the Afghan government for serious child sexual exploitation crimes committed by the Afghan police force. Martland and Quinn knew that two Afghan commanders were not prosecuted nor punished for the rape of a 15 year old girl and the honor killing of an Afghan commander s 12 year old daughter who kissed a boy. Martland who was fed up with the ongoing sexual exploitation of children by Afghan officials said,  I felt that morally we could no longer stand by and allow our Afghan Commanders to commit these atrocities. Since when is a highly decorated Green Beret who confronts a violent child sex predator and trafficker and woman beater, punished and involuntarily discharge from the military?What happened to the greatest military and force for moral good on the face of the planet? Isn t Martland carrying out the very anti human trafficking policies promulgated by the Obama Administration?Obama s administration, including his Pentagon, endlessly promotes and spends millions on sexual assault and human trafficking programs, policies and media messaging. The very human rights violations perpetrated upon innocent Afghan children are the ones which this Administration is demanding action to enforce zero tolerance:1.U.S. Department of Defense Policy Against Human Trafficking. In the press release praising the ongoing military awareness training of human trafficking, the Army media alert highlights the annual training and progress for DoD s military as  driving home the department s  zero tolerance  for slavery and human trafficking. Apparently, that DoD zero tolerance policy doesn t apply to Captain Quinn and Sgt. Martland. Is it simply awareness, but no action to stop human trafficking and sex slavery? Zero tolerance means stopping the cultural and systemic abduction and sex slavery of young Afghan boys. Is the DoD training report mere lip service and media hype to convince Americans that the U.S. military fights human trafficking and sex slavery?The DoD press release ends with the ironic caveat that  military leadership also plays a critical awareness role in preventing such crimes.  Sgt. Martland and Captain Dan Quinn are military leaders who  prevented  further human trafficking crimes and are now paying for it with their military careers.

15395,SHOCKING POLL: TRUMP PASSES BUSH AND RUBIO IN HOME STATE OF FLORIDA,"Maybe Florida isn t as pro-amnesty as Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio had hoped. That s gonna leave a mark For the first time this year, Donald Trump tops a state poll of GOP presidential candidates in Florida.A St. Pete Polls survey released on Wednesday shows the New York businessman with 26 percent support, with Jeb Bush in second place with 20 percent.Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker is in third place with 12 percent, and Marco Rubio is in fourth place with 10 percent. He s followed by Dr. Ben Carson at 5 percent, Ted Cruz and John Kasich at 4 percent, and Rand Paul at 3 percent. 16 percent are unsure or are supporting another candidate not named in the survey.When it comes to the GOP Senate race, however, there is no clear front-runner at all, some 13 months before the primary election.Among those who actually have an opinion, Pinellas County congressman David Jolly gets 10 percent support, with Lieutenant Governor Carlos Lopez-Cantera and Jacksonville area Congressman Ron DeSantis right behind him, essentially tied at 9 percent. Lopez-Cantera gets 9.2 percent support, DeSantis 8.9 percent.Former combat veteran and businessman Todd Wilcox gets 5 percent support (5.2%), tying him with North Florida congressman Jeff Miller (4.9%), who is not officially in the race.But an overwhelming 61 percent say they are undecided.That s a change from a similar poll taken two weeks ago, where Jolly garnered 22 percent support, 10 percent more than Miller.In terms of the reliability of this survey, Matt Florell of St. Pete Polls said his firm has had an impressive run the past three years, with several of its polls coming with the margin of error with final election results. The polling  almost always predicted the eventual winner of the election,  Florell said, citing the recent Jacksonville mayoral election and many of the general election races in 2014. But related to this specific poll,  he added,  I would refer back to our 2014 Democratic Primary poll and how close we were to the final results for both governor and attorney general. The poll of 1,902 Florida likely Republican primary voters was conducted from Saturday, July 18, 2015 to Tuesday, July 28, 2015. It was made up of a sampling of registered Republican party voters from the state of Florida, and has a 2.2% margin of error at a 95% confidence level.Via: St. Peters Blog",politics,"Jul 29, 2015"
6124, Check Out This Racist ‘What Do You Hate Most About Obama’ Poll Conservatives Are Sharing (IMAGES),"Conservatives just love to be stupid. They can t help it; it s a byproduct of believing the rhetoric, propaganda and lies spread by their corporate masters to keep them in line. We all know it; we see it every day. Now, for your viewing pleasure, a conservative page of almost 100K fans has given us some true insight into what matters most to them with a  what do you hate most about Obama  poll that shows the true colors and (lack of) intellect of a collective of like-minded imbeciles.First, let s start with the page itself. In the tradition of idiotic page names conservatives seem to love, this one is called  The Resistance: The Last Line of Defense.  Resistance against what? One could only imagine that it s resistance against the cruel Obama dictatorship that has guided our country through a recovery from the second worst financial crisis in its history. The  line of defense?  That would appear to be a series of dumbass memes that show intolerance and hate that is way over the top, even for these a**holes.Now that we re familiar with the cretins we re dealing with, let s have a look at the poll:If you were going to give five reasons to hate any other President, would the last two entries be necessary? Something tells me this may be a sign of some mild racism. Being a curiously adventurous soul, I fired up one of my alt accounts and messaged the page with a couple of questions about their choices. They were surprisingly cooperative:It was almost too good to be true for the purpose of this article. On the other hand, it s extraordinarily sad that people like this actually exist in the 21st century. Now for the moment you ve been waiting for. The results.Of the 332 respondents, only 6 chose  the color of his skin.  That would have been an indication that the racism we see directed at the president may be somewhat exaggerated had 98 (30 percent) of respondents chosen  He s a Muslim terrorist.  Here is the full list of results:So while 30 percent of respondents are racist piles of doody, more than 50 percent chose the most ambiguous answer possible, proving they have no idea why they hate President Obama. It would have been so much more convenient had they chosen skin color like they wanted to.And there you have it: a look inside the collective mindset of a bunch of Trump-loving racists.

They were so proud of their vandalism that they gave details to the Post of how long it took to vandalize the property.When I went to the article to read it, there was a disclaimer at the top. Well, if you go to the comments section at the end of the article, the comments are mostly ripping on the environmentalists AND the articles reference to the vandalism as a  DARING ACT OF DEFIANCE . So the editor replaced the phrase with a more accurate term of VANDALISM WHAT THESE PEOPLE DID IS DISGUSTING AND SO WRONG   GLORIFYING DESTRUCTION OF PRIVATE PROPERTY IS NEVER OK SHAME ON YOU WAPO!Editor s note: The beginning of this story was changed to more accurately reflect the nature of the actions taken by a protest group against the Trump golf course in Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif.The group   which labels itself an  anonymous environmental activist collective    snuck into Trump National Golf Club in Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif., and carved a message into the green with six-foot-tall letters that said:  NO MORE TIGERS.

Last year, Golf Digest ranked it the 43rd best course in California.In a statement sent to The Washington Post, the group said the vandalism was carried out in response to the Trump administration s  blatant disregard  for the environment: Tearing up the golf course felt justified in many ways,  the member said.  Repurposing what was once a beautiful stretch of land into a playground for the privileged is an environmental crime in its own right.

6720, Trump Just Accidentally Gave America The Greatest Reason Not To Vote For Him,"Donald Trump wanted to give his supporters a strong reason to support him, and instead he just handed the rest of America a great reason to fight like hell to ensure he never gets elected.At a campaign rally just days before a crucial primary day that could decide whether Trump gets the nomination before the convention or not, he told his followers that if he loses, he ll go into hiding, never to be seen again.Signalling yet again that he would not be willing to support another Republican should he lose the nomination, Trump said there was nothing sadder than watching a losing candidate grovel at the feet of the victor. Which, to be fair, is true if the victor is Donald Trump.Clearly not a fan of Ted Cruz, Trump suggested he would never go on to endorse him: They fight like hell for six months, and they re saying horrible things, the worst things you can imagine. And then one of them loses, one of them wins. And the one who loses says,  I just want to congratulate my opponent. He is a brilliant man, he ll be a great governor or president or whatever. So Trump made his supporters a promise: I m not sure you re ever going to see me there. I don t think I m going to lose, but if I do, I don t think you re ever going to see me again, folks. I think I ll go to Turnberry and play golf or something. It s bad enough that Trump is already playing the sore loser, but his gambit is almost sure to backfire. It s been well documented that Trump is despised at almost surreal levels. His unpopularity among nearly every demographic is so staggering that it s amazing he s made it this far. The sheer level of loathing people have for Donald Trump may be the one thing that can truly unite the country. He s hated by Hispanics. He s hated by women. He s hated by African Americans. He s hated by young people. He s hated by the one group the GOP could always count on, white men (yes, really).He s the most hated politician in three decades. The last person who came close? Richard Nixon post-Watergate. Even Dick Cheney   at the lowest moments of the Bush years   was hated by (slightly) fewer people.That s a massive number of people who would all but run to the polls if it meant Donald Trump never shows his face in front of a camera again. It s hard to imagine a better way Donald Trump could Make America Great Again than that.

12279,Trump’s Senior Advisor Slams Unpopular Mitt: Number Of Anti-Romney Messages From Trump Supporters Is Breathtaking [VIDEO],"I just want to start with what you just heard from Newt Gingrich and Mike Huckabee, both going public against Mitt Romney for secretary of state. You seemed to join in as well. You tweeted:  Receiving deluge of social media and private coms re: Romney. Some Trump loyalists warn against Romney as secretary of state. Do you think Mitt Romney could be a loyal secretary of state for Donald Trump?KELLYANNE CONWAY, TRUMP SENIOR ADVISER: I would hope so, because that s the first job of any secretary of state, Dana, is to support and work directly for and advise the president for whom you work.I felt compelled to mention it because I   it s just breathtaking in scope and intensity the type of messages I have received from all over the country. And I m just me. I m not Donald Trump.And so, just as his former campaign manager, the number of people who feel betrayed to think that a Governor Romney would get the most prominent Cabinet post, after he went so far out of his way to hurt Donald Trump   there was the never-Trump movement and then there was Mitt Romney.He gave speeches against Donald Trump. He attacked his character. I never heard Governor Romney come out and say, hey, you know, I have a problem with X, Y and Z, but that 25 million job creation plan over the next 10 years is really something to look at. The fact that you will reduce the capital gains tax and the tax on employers and businesses, or you will unleash energy investment, or you have 10-point plan to reform the Veterans Administration, none of that was ever said.And his   the Romney consultants transparent were the worst to all of us, including Mr. Trump. Their Twitter feeds were complete 100 percent anti-Trump screed.And, look, if president-elect Trump chooses Mitt Romney as his secretary of state, or whomever he chooses, that will have the full support and backing of all of us. I respect the brilliance and judgment and sheer instincts of president-elect Trump to form his Cabinet as he wishes.But I felt compelled to come forward on behalf of the people who were weighing in.Watch:https://youtu.be/CiokZm91hCA",politics,"Nov 27, 2016"
16654,WHY DID GOP LEADERS Silence Opposition On Puerto Rico Bankruptcy Bill? This Is What Americans Are 100% FED Up! With!,"Here s yet another example of the leadership in the Republican Party putting themselves and their political careers before the American people. Rep. John fleming of Louisiana is a good man and did the right thing in releasing the truth about the effort to to have a recorded vote. THIS is why the American people are 100% FED Up! with Washington!In yet another display of misplaced priorities, House leadership plans to fast-track the new debt restructuring bill for Puerto Rico in light of their $70 billion debt crisis. But what happened last night at a meeting held in the Natural Resources Committee, demonstrates a new degree of desperation.Earlier this afternoon, Rep. John Fleming (R-LA) released a statement divulging the details of that meeting. He said that members of the committee were asked by House leaders, which presumably includes the committee chairman, Rob Bishop (R-UT), to not ask for a recorded vote on the bill when it comes before the committee this evening. According to Fleming, they were told not to show up to the markup if they plan to request a recorded vote.The benefit of a voice vote is to push the quasi-bailout package to the floor by acclamation and protect vulnerable members from a divisive committee vote. Rob Bishop, for example, faces a primary challenge in his northern Utah district later in the spring.Here is the full statement from Rep. Fleming: In all my time in Congress, no one has ever asked me to do something quite like this, until last night. I was angry. To be asked to walk away to be told to miss a vote   is a request that flies in the face of every member s conscience. Leadership had no business making such a request.  I thought perhaps I was mistaken about what was really being asked of me. But when it was clear they were seriously asking members of the Committee to stand aside so the bill could pass without amendment or vote, I strongly objected along with some other members. This is the kind of  go along  politics Americans and I are tired of. Anytime we don t have full transparency we have a bad outcome.  If the bill comes before the Committee as planned, I will insist on a recorded vote and I will do my best to defeat any bailout this Committee puts before us.  Members weren t even given the discussion draft of the bill (H.R. 4900) until last night. Now they are voting on it less than 24 hours later and were told not to voice concerns about the legislation.Read more: CR ",Government News,"Apr 14, 2016"

5323, Nate Silver Has A Frightening Prediction For The 2016 Election,"If sane Americans have done one stupid thing over the last year, it s not take Donald Trump seriously. Unfortunately, there s a lot of discontent among the right toward the changing face of the United States and on the left, there s discontent over the fact that the United States isn t changing fast enough, and that discontentment could easily land Donald Trump in the White House, according to FiveThirtyEight s statistical guru, Nate Silver.While the polls are in a virtual tie, a breakdown of electoral college votes paints a much bleaker picture. According to Silver, Trump is ahead of Clinton by a whopping 15 points.Silver s  now-cast,  updated with fresh surveys on Monday, shows Trump s current likelihood of winning at 57.5 percent, compared with Clinton s 42.5 percent. In the 11 battleground states, Colorado, Virginia and Michigan would go to Clinton, while Florida, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Iowa would go to Trump.The breakdown shifts a bit between the Electoral College and the popular vote. Silver s model currently predicts the popular vote going 45.4 percent to Trump vs. 45.1 percent to Clinton, but the Electoral College giving Trump a wider margin of victory, 285 votes and Clinton 252.6.Source: PoliticoThis warning alone should be enough to wake up some who are on the fence and some Bernie Sanders supporters, but not all is lost. Silver notes that polling during conventions is notoriously inaccurate.On the one hand, the conventions are not a particularly good time to sweat every tick in the polls. Instead, they tend to be one of the less accurate times for polling. Historically, it s unusual for candidates not to at least pull into a rough tie after their party convention   John McCain and Sarah Palin did so in 2008, for example, and even Walter Mondale led a couple of polls in 1984. But those bounces do not always turn out to be predictive.Silver has another hand, though, and he s saying that Clinton has had a very bad July. She could get a convention bump this week, but with Wikileaks  email dump and Sanders supporters protesting every single speaker, it s doubtful. In other words, be afraid, but vote and drive people to the polls if necessary.Featured image via Slaven Vlasic at Getty Images. ",News,"July 25, 2016"
12902,LESTER HOLT PULLS A “Candy Crowley” 5 Times…Joins Team Hillary To Help Debate Trump,"Who won the debate tonight? Donald J. Trump or the Lester Holt-Clinton team?NBC News  Lester Holt had his  Candy Crowley  moment at the first debate of the 2016 presidential election on Monday night, bowing to pressure from the Hillary Clinton campaign and the liberal media by  fact-checking  Republican nominee Donald Trump on the question of his support for the Iraq War.Holt lived up to the expectations of his peers. But he lived down to the worst expectations of conservatives, who routinely see Republican candidates treated unfairly by debate moderators.Hillary also went over the 2 minute mark several times, while there were several times when Lester Holt would cut Donald Trump off after only having a little over a minute to answer a question. Again and again, Holt asked Trump tough questions that were straight from the Clinton campaign s talking points, and which were obvious set-ups for Clinton to attack (and for fact-checkers to pounce on whatever Trump asserted in his own defense).Here are the five worst examples.Tax returns. Holt never asked Clinton about her e-mail scandal, about Benghazi, or about the Clinton Foundation and its dubious dealings. But he did ask Trump about his tax returns, arguing   not asking   that there might be questionable information in them that the American public deserved to hear.Birther conspiracy theory. Holt never asked Clinton about her past record of racist statements, including her  super-predator  remarks as First Lady, or her explicit appeal to  white Americans  in her 2008 primary campaign against Obama. Yet he asked Trump about the Birther conspiracy theory and cast it as racist.Stop-and-frisk. After an exchange between the candidates over the policy of  stop-and-frisk,  Holt interjected to bolster Clinton s point by stating, erroneously, that stop-and-frisk had ended in New York because it had been declared unconstitutional by a court. Trump countered, correctly, that the new mayor had canceled the policy before the litigation was over. A presidential look.  Towards the end of the debate, Holt asked Trump about what he meant by saying Hillary Clinton did not have  a presidential look.  He did so after noting that Clinton had become  the first woman  to be nominated for president by a major political party, thus setting Trump up as a sexist. As Trump answered, Holt interrupted him, then gave Clinton a chance to respond with her talking points about Trump s past comments on women.Iraq War. The question of whether Trump supported the Iraq War or not has been widely debated. What is beyond doubt is that Hillary Clinton voted for it. Holt only represented one side of the debate about Trump, and never asked Clinton about her own vote. Via: Breitbart",politics,"Sep 26, 2016"
18156,#CHARLOTTESVILLE While Media and Politicians Stir the Pot…Are We Missing the Elephant in the Room?,"A tweet caught my eye after exploring all of the hate and violence posted from Charlottesville. Did you dig deeper and do you know: Who Paid For Helmets, Bus Rentals, Body Armor on both sides in Charlottesville? Are we missing the elephant in the room? Is this event being used for political purposes (see VA Gov. McAuliffe video below) to shut down free speech and to denounce President Trump who has NO CONNECTION to any of these radical groups? George Soros must be so proud right now What s missing in all of the news reports is that the group that got permission to rally (we don t agree with them but they got permission to rally) was infiltrated by bussed in Black Lives Matter and Antifa thugs who are very violent. Remember Berkeley? The rally then became a violent mob Was this the plan by the left when they bussed in hundreds in opposition?

2361," Trump TRASHES Sean Spicer’s Cell Phone Checks, Signals Trump Team Implosion (VIDEO)","The Trump team is caving in on itself, and Donald Trump s latest comments certainly won t help.Earlier today, Trump appeared on Fox & Friends where he blatantly criticized White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer. Addressing the mysterious and numerous leaks that have been coming out of the White House, Spicer was reported to be checking the professional and personal cell phones of White House staffers in the West Wing to make sure they weren t involved in leaking any information. It was a drastic move, and we ve never seen such distrust within an administration, and yet Trump still claims everything in the White House is running like a  well-oiled machine.  But something tells us that after Spicer hears what Trump just said, things are going to change.In his exclusive White House interview, Trump admitted that he wouldn t have handled the leaks the way Spicer did. Steve Doocey asked Trump: Sean Spicer asked his communication team,  Alright come on in everybody. Put your phone right over there. We have a leaker here. We re gonna have the White House lawyer look at your phones.  How intent are you on finding who the leaker or leakers are in your administration? Not just your communications team, but over at the State Department, maybe the intel community, everywhere? Trump first bragged about how great his press secretary was (even though there have been several reports that state Trump is unhappy with Spicer s performance and would rather replace him with a woman). He said, Well first of all, Sean Spicer is a fine human being. He s a fine person. Then Trump criticized Spicer: I would have done it differently. I would have gone one-on-one with different people. I would have handled it different than Sean, but Sean handles it his way, and I m OK with it. Hinting that he felt Spicer was going far too easy on staffers, Trump joked that if it were up to him,  there are things you can do that are a hell of a lot worse.

4775, Longtime GOP Consultant Throws His Party Under The Bus By Explaining Voter ID Laws,"A longtime Republican consultant, Carter Wrenn, has finally said what the rest of the GOP won t about voter ID laws. In-person voter fraud is an excuse, and the laws that force people to obtain certain identification, along with limiting or eliminating early voting and other provisions, wouldn t happen if the black community would just vote Republican.You can t make this up. Wrenn told the Washington Post: Look, if African Americans voted overwhelmingly Republican, they would have kept early voting right where it was. It wasn t about discriminating against African Americans. They just ended up in the middle of it because they vote Democrat. So it was about discriminating against African-Americans. How on Earth does Wrenn get from  If African Americans voted overwhelmingly Republican  to,  This wasn t about discrimination?  There s no way to make that leap of logic without an awful lot of crazy gymnastics.Basically, Wrenn just admitted that Republicans wouldn t push down the black community if the black community would just do what Republicans want. Republicans would probably be all for fixing inner cities, passing jobs bills, passing crime bills, ensuring the social safety net isn t gutted, and more, if the black community voted Republican. But, since they don t, fuck  em. The GOP has to protect its majorities, after all.Wake County, in North Carolina, the state whose voter ID law Wrenn was discussing, says that more early voting would just waste tax dollars and cause additional chaos. Excuses, excuses, and flimsy ones at that. All the county boards in North Carolina are Republican under state law because the governor is a Republican. They re apparently all on his side with rationalizing away their blatant discrimination any way they can.The Supreme Court refused to grant a stay on a lower court s decision that North Carolina s law was crafted with the specific intent of suppressing the black vote. Governor Pat McCrory threw a livid fit, saying that the Court had denied basic voting rights to North Carolina that other states are allowed to enjoy.It s really the state that s trying to deny basic voting rights to their black community, all in the name of  preventing voter fraud,  and protecting  one person, one vote.  McCrory has his lies all lined up in a neat little row, though, and will use them, one after the other, for as long as he has to.The GOP needs to clean its own house before they cry about voter fraud. Their standard-bearer s own campaign CEO is guilty of attempting voter fraud, which just makes them utter hypocrites for tolerating that and whining up a storm about the need to prevent voter fraud.But don t call them racist, and don t call these laws racist! The GOP has this strange need to convince itself that this isn t about racism. Consider this, though: even if it truly wasn t about racism, they re still working to actively deny people their constitutional right to vote. Wrenn just damned his party with that interview.Featured image by Mario Tama/Getty Images",News,"September 4, 2016"

Pitha s boyfriend, 36-year-old Christopher Hustrulid, signed for the package when it was delivered Tuesday afternoon, right before a search warrant was served.Detective Doug Matteson said that the two children, ages 5 and 10,  had easy access to all of (the) drugs and materials, even the bomb-making materials that were located in the back with the meth lab.

14509,NEW EMAILS SHOW HILLARY Asking How Meeting On Libyan War Would Impact Hamptons Vacation…And MORE,"These grifters have no shame. How much more evidence do Americans need to see before they understand Hillary has no interest in our nation s security? How much more evidence do we need before the Everyday American Queen of the Clinton Crime Syndicate is sent to prison? Judicial Watch today released nearly 70 pages of State Department records that show that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her top aides, Deputy Chiefs of Staff Huma Abedin and Jake Sullivan, received and sent classified information on their non-state.gov email accounts. The documents, also available on the State Department website, were obtained in response to a court order from a May 5, 2015, lawsuit filed against the State Department (Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Department of State (No. 1:15-cv-00684)) after it failed to respond to a March 18 Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request seeking:All emails of official State Department business received or sent by former Deputy Chief of Staff Huma Abedin from January 1, 2009 through February 1, 2013 using a non- state.gov  email address.The new documents show that Hillary Clinton used the clintonemail.com system to ask Huma Abedin (also on a non-state.gov email account) to print two March 2011 emails, which were sent from former British Prime Minister Tony Blair (using the moniker  aclb ) to Jake Sullivan on Sullivan s non-state.gov email account. The Obama State Department redacted the Blair emails under Exemption (b)(1) which allows the withholding of classified material. The material is marked as being classified as  Foreign government information  and  foreign relations or foreign activities of the US, including confidential sources. Another email shows that Clinton wanted to know how meetings in Washington, including a four-hour meeting concerning America s war on Libya, would impact her Hampton vacation. Responding to an email that details the sensitive meetings in DC, Clinton emails Abedin on August 26, 2011,  Ok. What time would I get back to Hamptons?  Again, this email discussion takes place on non-state.gov email accounts.The documents also include advice to Clinton on Libya from Sidney Blumenthal, a Clinton Foundation employee who, according to a Judicial Watch investigative report, also had business interests in Libya. Clinton wanted Blumenthal s March 9, 2011, Libya memo to be printed  without any identifiers. The newly released Abedin emails include a lengthy exchange giving precise details of Clinton s schedule using unsecured government emails. The email from Lona J. Valmoro, former Special Assistant to Secretary of State Clinton, to Abedin and Clinton reveals exact times (including driving times) and locations of all appointments throughout the day. Another itinerary email provides details about a meeting at the United Nations in New York at 3:00 on Tuesday, January 31, 2012, with the precise disclosure,  that would mean wheels up from Andrews at approximately 12:00pm/12:15pm. These emails show that Hillary Clinton isn t the only Obama official who should be worried about being prosecuted for mishandling classified information. Her former top State aides (and current campaign advisers) Huma Abedin and Jake Sullivan should be in the dock, as well,  said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton.  The Obama State Department has now confirmed that Clinton, Abedin, and Sullivan used unsecured, non-government email accounts to communicate information that should now be withheld from the American people  in the interest of national defense or foreign policy, and properly classified.

20164,WOW! ANOTHER YOUNG MAN Found DEAD After Serving DNC With Papers In Fraud Suit On Behalf Of Bernie Sanders [VIDEO],"That s the third suspicious death of a man tied in some way to Hillary. Does anyone in law enforcement have an accurate body count of suspicious deaths tied to Hillary? We recently questioned the suspicious murder of 27 year old Democrat Data Director Seth Rich, as he was walking home through his affluent Washington DC neighborhood. He was beaten and shot in the back, but apparently nothing of any value was taken from his body, which would likely mean robbery was not a motive. If robbery wasn t a motive and the police still have no clues what exactly was the motive for his brutal murder? In our previous article, we explored the possibility that he may have been about to blow the whistle on voter fraud. Does anyone have an actual tally of the number of people who had ties to the Clintons that ended up dead? Now Bernie Sanders supporter and activist Shawn Lucas is found dead.On July 3, 2016, Shawn Lucas and filmmaker Ricardo Villaba served the DNC Services Corp. and Chairperson Debbie Wasserman Schultz at DNC s headquarters in Washington, D.C., in the fraud class action suit against the Democrat Party on behalf of Bernie Sanders supporters.Shawn Lucas was thrilled about serving the papers to the DNC before Independence Day.According to Snopes Lucas was found dead on his bathroom floor.We contacted Lucas  employer on 4 August 2016 to ask whether there was any truth to the rumor. According to an individual with whom we spoke at that company, Shawn Lucas died on 2 August 2016. The audibly and understandably shaken employee stated that interest in the circumstances of Lucas  death had prompted a number of phone calls and other queries, but the company had not yet ascertained any details about Lucas  cause of death and were unable to confirm anything more than the fact he had passed away.An unconfirmed report holds that Lucas was found lying on the bathroom floor by his girlfriend when she returned home on the evening of 2 August 2016. Paramedics responding to her 911 call found no signs of life.** This was before Wikileaks released documents proving the DNC was working against the Sanders campaign during the 2016 primary.Shawn Lucas was found dead this week.This follows the death of 27 year-old Democratic staffer Seth Conrad Rich who was murdered in Washington DC on July 8. The killer or killers appear to have taken nothing from their victim, leaving behind his wallet, watch and phone. Shortly after the killing, Redditors and social media users were pursuing a  lead  saying that Rich was en route to the FBI the morning of his murder, apparently intending to speak to special agents about an  ongoing court case  possibly involving the Clinton family.Watch here:And on June 22, 2016, former UN official John Ashe  accidentally  crushed his own throat and died a week before he was scheduled to testify against the Clintons and Democrat Party.Via: Gateway Pundit",left-news,"Aug 5, 2016"
9250,PHILADELPHIA Committee Passes Bill Forcing Store Owners to Remove Bullet-Proof Glass…Because it’s Offensive,"What s more important, protecting the dignity of customers who shop in local liquor stores, or the innocent employees and store owners who come in every day, knowing that the only thing that ensures they will go home alive, is the bullet-proof glass between them and the criminal element who enters their store? Well, according to one Philadelphia councilwoman, it s the dignity of the customers. Philadelphia s Public Health and Human Services Committee passed a bill Monday to ban shop owners from protecting themselves with bulletproof plexiglass.Philadelphia 8th District Councilwoman Cindy Bass, who is behind the bill, said previously that having to see plexiglass represents an  indignity  to her constituents and should, therefore, be banned.  Information LiberationFOX News   Philadelphia is one step closer to getting rid of bulletproof glass in many of its small businesses as part of a larger effort to crack down on loitering, public urination, and potential drug sales   but the potential ban has triggered a backlash from shopkeepers.The city s Public Health and Human Services Committee passed a bill Monday enabling Philadelphia s Department of Licenses and Inspections to regulate the bullet-resistant barricades that stand between customers and cash registers in many neighborhood corner stores, according to FOX29. No establishment required to obtain a Large Establishment license   shall erect or maintain a physical barrier that requires the persons serving the food either to open a window or other aperture or to pass the food through a window or other aperture, in order to hand the food to a customer inside the establishment,  the bill states. It also calls for larger establishments to have bathrooms for customers.Here s a great example of the crime Philadelphia officers deal with every day in a city where the elected officials are more worried about passing laws to protect the dignity of liquor store customers, and not the people who bravely come to work every day to sell goods in dangerous, crime-ridden neighborhoods.

His mouth has no filter, and he says whatever is on his mind at any time without thinking about the consequences of his speech. And then when people call him on his obnoxious rhetoric, instead of backing down or clarifying, he owns the rhetoric and doubles down on it.Now, it yet another moment of being incapable of using critical thinking skills, Donald Trump compares the Rolling Thunder rally, which is pretty much all motorcycles, to Martin Luther King Jr. s march on Washington, and then he also wants the motorcycles to be able to drive all over the National Mall. He doesn t like that they re only able to drive on the streets. However, anyone with a thinking brain could tell you that we shouldn t destroy the National Mall and have it torn up with hundreds, if not thousands, of motorcycles.If Trump sincerely means all the things that he says then we ve got a pretty big problem on our hands if he actually becomes president.

10494,NUMEROUS PUBLIC Rapes Of Teenage Girls Reported At Swedish Music Festivals: “Rapes at Swedish festivals are not really news anymore”,"Last year, we reported about women who attended an  anti-racism  music festival in Sweden that were raped and molested by migrant men. This report is yet another shocking example of how the west is actually importing a real rape culture.According to police spokesman Stefan Dangardt, numerous  foreign men  sexually assaulted the women during Borl nge s  Peace and Love  festival, although three suspects who were arrested were later released because they claimed they were minors.It appears that nothing has changed since last year. Yesterday, Swedish police received several reports of rape after   music festivals at various locations on Friday evening.A 15-year-old girl was raped during a concert at the Br valla Festival in Norrk ping on Friday night.According to the police, the girl was held and raped by a man in the midst of the crowd in front of the concert goers, without anyone intervening.  It s terrible that one has to experience such a thing with a lot of people around, says police spokesman, Thomas Agnevik, to Aftonbladet.We have little information about the perpetrator and about what has happened, he said, while encouraging those present during the concert to contact the police if they saw anything suspicious.The girl was taken care of and underwent a medical examination.During the City Festival in V ster s, two rapes were reported, one of a 16 year old girl.  We have talked to her and obtained information, but we currently have no suspects, said spokesperson for the police in V stmanland, Thomas Gustafsson.A 26-year-old woman has also reported rape after the festival.  She has been sent to hospital and we have been unable to talk to her. Therefore, I do not have any more details, says Gustafsson.Rapes at Swedish festivals are not really news anymore. It is merely about announcements. We are actually there now.  Speisa",politics,"Jul 1, 2017"
5207, Crying Girl Is Convinced Trump Will Deport Her Family After She Gets Wisdom Teeth Pulled (VIDEO),"A father decided to record his daughter after she got her wisdom teeth removed and probably got a more interesting response than he bargained for. In a video that is making the rounds on social media, he asks the teen girl if she would vote for Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton. At the mention of Trump s name, she instantly began crying. Oh my God, Donald Trump is the redneck leader,  she says quite accurately.  He s going to take you away from me. Why would he take me away?  dad asks. Because it s the redneck people that take us away from here,  she replies   once again, accurately. She then begins rambling incoherently in what sounds like Arabic. I need to go. Oh my god, Allah needs to come protect me from this.  Then she begins praying. Oh my god, he is a redneck,  the girl says, adding that  he looks like an orange  and  his parents were so ugly. He s going to kick me out, he s going to kick all of us out,  the hysterical girl cries as her father reminds her she was born in the United States, in Utah.Technically, that just means that he would force her to register in a national database, wear a special little badge informing everyone she is a Muslim, and be rounded up into a concentration camp  you know, as a  temporary measure. The teen then notices her mouth is bleeding and asks,  Is this blood from the rednecks? While this is hilarious, the question of what Donald Trump will do to her family and every other Muslim in the United States must be weighing on the girl s mind in some form. Unfortunately, Muslims will not like the answer to that.Watch the video below:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMxrjfoMmi4Featured image via screengrab/Getty Images (John Moore)",News,"August 2, 2016"

Then he opened his mouth.In a surreal reminder of just how oblivious Trump is, the president who had spent months pushing for Congress to strip access to medical care away from Americans turned to the Australian PM and remarked that Australia has a much better health care system than the United States. We have a failing health care. I shouldn t say this to the great gentleman and my friend from Australia because you have better health care than we do. Like many developed nations, Australia has universal health care for all citizens. They have  better health care than we do  in large part because Republicans spend so much time and energy ensuring many Americans can t get access to insurance. Trump just admitted   in front of rolling cameras   that his latest health care efforts, the reason he s taking a victory lap, actually make Americans worse off than citizens of other countries.The exchanged prompted MSNBC s Chris Hayes and guest Sen.

Like the majority of people in her field, her work has been praised by some and not liked by others. Yet, ever since her spat with Donald Trump, she has been catapulted to a level of unprecedented notoriety. In some ways, her new found fame has had positive ramifications, but in other ways it has been frightening, especially when you factor in Donald Trump. He seems to have inspired many people, some of them with racist and violent tendencies.Kelly knows first hand what it is  like to get on the bad side of Trump supporters because she has been receiving death threats. Kelly said,  It s not so much what he writes or says, it s how he gins up anger among so many, so it manifests in my life in several ways.  Kelly has cause to worry that  someone s gonna hurt me in the presence of my children. As disturbing as this revelation is, one has to keep in mind that there has been a consistent thread of violence or calls to violence when it comes to Donald Trump and his campaign: People have been attacked and/or kicked out of his rallies for opposing his views and Trump has repeatedly called for violence against those who oppose him at his cult-like rallies.The hope is that the simmering nightmare that is Trump will go away and he will not  have an opportunity to have actual tangible power in the form of the presidency.Watch video here: [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjWEoD9aj0I]Featured image via video screenshot",News,"April 3, 2016"

Although the golden shower accusation was the least important detail of the report, it certainly caught the attention of the public and was enough to make just about anyone say no way this can be legit. But according to CNN, U.S. intelligence agencies have been investigating the dossier and the document is gaining credibility because some of the details it contains are actually checking out.CNN reports:Law enforcement and U.S. intelligence agencies are continuing their investigation, but they say the corroboration of intercepted communications gives them a  greater confidence  in the dossier s validity.Naturally, Trump s team is already screaming  fake news    again. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer told CNN,  We continue to be disgusted by CNN s fake news reporting.  He then called back to add this:This is more fake news. It is about time CNN focused on the success the President has had bringing back jobs, protecting the nation, and strengthening relationships with Japan and other nations. The President won the election because of his vision and message for the nation.Intelligence officials emphasized that the conversations they intercepted were between foreign nationals and came from routine information gathering. They also noted that some of the communications were from people who were known to be  heavily involved  in digging up dirt on Hillary Clinton to help Trump.U.S. intelligence agencies have still not come to any final conclusions regarding whether or not Russia really has any compromising information on Trump that they can use to blackmail him. They have also not confirmed any of the more  salacious  claims made in the dossier. In other words, they still don t know if Trump paid Russian prostitutes to  drain the swamp  for him.You see more on this here, via The Young Turks:.@CNN is reporting that an investigation into the  Pee-gate  dossier is gaining credibility. pic.twitter.com/j6CEHZJktN  The Young Turks (@TheYoungTurks) February 11, 2017Featured image via Andrew Harrer   Pool/Getty Images",News,"February 11, 2017"
491, Disgusting Trump Is Using Hurricane As An Opportunity To Deport People,"A Category Four hurricane has hit Texas. It s set to be the most disastrous hurricane since Katrina hit Louisiana in 2005, yet Donald Trump is using it as an opportunity to deport people.Thousands of people are evacuating the affected areas, trying to beat the storm. Instead of helping ensure that evacuations go smoothly, the Trump administration is doing the exact opposite. They are creating checkpoints and forcing people to show their  papers  proving they are documented residents of the United States.The federal government is closing border patrol checkpoints in the path of the hurricane, but they re leaving checkpoints open outside the path. The Texas Tribune reports: Border Patrol checkpoints will not be closed unless there is a danger to the safety of the traveling public and our agents. Border Patrol resources, including personnel and transportation, will be deployed on an as needed basis to augment the efforts and capabilities of local-response authorities,  the agency said in a statement.The Border Patrol is a law enforcement agency and we will not abandon our law enforcement duties. I m sure you can imagine the consequences. Sure, checkpoints will only be open outside the path of the hurricane, but they can still cause traffic to back up for miles. It will also all but ensure that undocumented immigrants and their families will stay behind, only to be potentially killed by the hurricane or the resulting floods.Civil rights agencies like the ACLU are furious. This is a disgusting move from the Border Patrol that breaks with past practices,  American Civil Liberties Union director of immigration policy and campaigns Lorella Praeli said.  The Border Patrol should never keep checkpoints open during any natural disasters in the United States. Everyone, no matter the color of their skin or background, is worth saving. Everyone, no matter the color of their skin or background, is worth saving.  Except to Donald Trump, they really aren t.

1812," FBI Releases DAMNING Information About Russian Collusion, Trump TERRIFIED","The Washington Post reported Tuesday that former Trump advisor Carter Page was one of the members of the Trump campaign who were monitored by the FBI because of their communications with Russia. As part of an investigation into the campaign that long predates Director James Comey s infamous  Clinton email  letter that helped swing the election in Donald Trump s favor, a judge granted the Bureau s request   a decision that is not made lightly:The FBI and the Justice Department obtained the warrant targeting Carter Page s communications after convincing a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court judge that there was probable cause to believe Page was acting as an agent of a foreign power, in this case Russia, according to the officials.This is the clearest evidence so far that the FBI had reason to believe during the 2016 presidential campaign that a Trump campaign adviser was in touch with Russian agents. Such contacts are now at the center of an investigation into whether the campaign coordinated with the Russian government to swing the election in Trump s favor.Page says that the real story isn t the fire   it s that people reported the fire. This confirms all of my suspicions about unjustified, politically motivated government surveillance,  Page told the Post, failing to mention that a judge would not have granted the warrant if there was not already convincing evidence it was necessary.  I have nothing to hide. Ever since his administration began leaking like a colander, Trump and his crew have been working overtime to convince the American people that the information itself is unimportant (no matter how important it is), that the real problem is that someone is telling us about it.

While most people would turn to cutting unnecessary government programs, compassionate Californians instead, turn to finding ways to eliminate humans who are a drain on the system.The Democrats appear to have found a solution to the massive costs of caring for humans. If you re living outside of the womb (we already know you have no rights if you re living inside the womb in CA) and are a burden on society, you might want to consider packing your bags and making a quick exit out of Communist California   Democrats in California might have found a solution for the burgeoning costs of Medi-Cal which still doesn t provide any palliative care and offers only one in every three a chance of getting cancer treatments. The solution they ve come up with is doctor-assisted suicide also known as euthanasia. That s right, they re going to end the lives of some people on the program.They are willing to put their money where their mouths are and Governor Moonbeam Brown, in addition to putting it in the budget, will allow this expansion to take place before the new proposed law even takes effect.It s hard to remember a case where they were this enthusiastic and worked this fast.The lethal drugs will cost $5400 per patient but it s a lot cheaper than keeping them alive and providing care.The proponents claim it has nothing to do with saving costs but they said it during the session called to address the ever-growing deficit in Medi-Cal.Enthusiastically, Governor Moonbeam put $2.3 million into the budget to off 443 Medi-Cal patients. The doctor of death only has to visit twice and only nine of the planned 443 targeted patients will be sent for mental health evaluations.The proponents want another quarter million to hire staff to help with the Euthanasia regulations and DHCS wants another $323,000 to set up a database.One of the original authors of the bill, Senator Bill Monning (D-Carmel), has proposed a toll-free number for the public to find out how to arrange suicide with the help of a doctor.No effort will be too small to get this sure-fire deficit buster going. Liberals  love this sort of thing.Leftist Robert Reich on assisted suicide:Dr. Kevorkian once went to jail for this.California just extended Medi-Cal to 170,000 illegal immigrant children and they want to extend it to all illegal immigrants.

14353,“They Will Kill Him Before They Let Him Become President”,"This letter was originally attributed to well-known conservative commentator and radio talk show host, Bill Bennett. Bennett has since denied ever writing this letter. Some are saying this letter was written by Wayne Allen Root, however we can find no evidence to verify that Root wrote this letter either. We believe the letter has some outstanding points and should be read by every voter as they consider the candidate they will support for President in 2016.Here is the letter that was sent to 100% FED Up:What I see happening in a Trump Presidency:They will kill him before they let him be president. It could be a Republican or a Democrat that instigates the shutting up of Trump.Don t be surprised if Trump has an accident. Some people are getting very nervous: Barack Obama, Valerie Jarrett, Eric Holder, Hillary Clinton and Jon Corzine, to name just a few.It s about the unholy dynamics between big government, big business, and big media. They all benefit by the billions of dollars from this partnership, and it s in all of their interests to protect one another. It s one for all and all for one. It s a heck of a filthy relationship that makes everyone filthy rich, everyone except the American people. We get ripped off. We re the patsies. But for once, the powerful socialist cabal and the corrupt crony capitalists are scared. The over-the-top reaction to Trump by politicians of both parties, the media, and the biggest corporations of America has been so swift and insanely angry that it suggests they are all threatened and frightened.Donald Trump can self-fund. No matter how much they say to the contrary, the media, business, and political elite understand that Trump is no joke. He could actually win and upset their nice cozy apple cart.It s no coincidence that everyone has gotten together to destroy The Donald. It s because most of the other politicians are part of the a good old boys club. They talk big, but they won t change a thing. They are all beholden to big-money donors. They are all owned by lobbyists, unions, lawyers, gigantic environmental organizations, and multinational corporations   like Big Pharmacy or Big Oil. Or they are owned lock, stock, and barrel by foreigners like George Soros owns Obama or foreign governments own Hillary and their Clinton Foundation donations.These run-of-the-mill establishment politicians are all puppets owned by big money. But there s one man who isn t beholden to anyone. There s one man who doesn t need foreigners, or foreign governments, or George Soros, or the United Auto Workers, or the teacher s union, or the Service Employees International Union, or the Bar Association to fund his campaign.Billionaire tycoon and maverick Donald Trump doesn t need anyone s help. That means he doesn t care what the media says. He doesn t care what the corporate elites think. That makes him very dangerous to the entrenched interests. That makes Trump a huge threat to those people. Trump can ruin everything for the bribed politicians and their spoiled slave masters.Don t you ever wonder why the GOP has never tried to impeach Obama? Don t you wonder why John Boehner and Mitch McConnell talk a big game, but never actually try to stop Obama? Don t you wonder why Congress holds the purse strings, yet has never tried to de-fund Obamacare or Obama s clearly illegal executive action on amnesty for illegal aliens? Bizarre, right? It defies logic, right?First, I d guess many key Republicans are being bribed. Secondly, I believe many key Republicans are being blackmailed. Whether they are having affairs, or secretly gay, or stealing taxpayer money, the National Security Agency knows everything.Ask former House Speaker Dennis Hastert about that. The government even knew he was withdrawing large sums of his own money from his own bank account. The NSA, the SEC, the IRS, and all the other three-letter government agencies are watching every Republican political leader. They surveil everything. Thirdly, many Republicans are petrified of being called racists, so they are scared to ever criticize Obama or call out his crimes, let alone demand his impeachment. Fourth , why rock the boat? After defeat or retirement, if you re a good old boy, you ve got a $5 million-per-year lobbying job waiting. The big-money interests have the system gamed. Win or lose, they win.But Trump doesn t play by any of these rules. Trump breaks up this nice, cozy relationship between big government, big media, and big business. All the rules are out the window if Trump wins the Presidency. The other politicians will protect Obama and his aides but not Trump. Remember: Trump is the guy who publicly questioned Obama s birth certificate. He questioned Obama s college records and how a mediocre student got into an Ivy League university. Now, he s doing something no Republican has the chutzpah to do. He s questioning our relationship with Mexico; he s questioning why the border is wide open; he s questioning why no wall has been built across the border; he s questioning if allowing millions of illegal aliens into America is in our best interests; he s questioning why so many illegal aliens commit violent crimes, yet are not deported; and he s questioning why our trade deals with Mexico, Russia and China are so bad.Trump has the audacity to ask out loud why American workers always get the short end of the stick. Good question! I m certain Trump will question what happened to the almost billion dollars given in a rigged no-bid contract to college friends of Michelle Obama at foreign companies to build the defective Obamacare website. By the way, that tab is now up to $5 billion. Trump will ask if Obamacare s architects can be charged with fraud for selling it by lying. Trump will investigate Obama s widespread IRS conspiracy, not to mention Obama s college records. Trump will prosecute Clinton and Obama for fraud committed to cover up Benghazi before the election. How about the fraud committed by employees of the Labor Department when they made up dramatic job numbers in the last jobs report before the 2012 election?Obama, the multinational corporations and the media need to stop Trump. They recognize this could get out of control. If left unchecked, telling the raw truth and asking questions everyone else is afraid to ask, Trump could wake a sleeping giant. Trump s election would be a nightmare. Obama has committed many crimes. No one else but Trump would dare to prosecute. He will not hesitate. Once Trump gets in and gets a look at the cooked books and Obama s records, the game is over. The goose is cooked. Holder could wind up in prison. Jarrett could wind up in prison. Obama bundler Corzine could wind up in prison for losing $1.5 billion of customer money. Clinton could wind up in jail for deleting 32,000 emails or for accepting bribes from foreign governments while Secretary of State, or for misplacing $6 billion as the head of the State Department, or for lying about Benghazi. The entire upper level management of the IRS could wind up in prison.Obamacare will be de-funded and dismantled. Obama himself could wind up ruined, his legacy in tatters. Trump will investigate. Trump will prosecute. Trump will go after everyone involved. That s why the dogs of hell have been unleashed on Donald Trump.Yes, it s become open season on Donald Trump. The left and the right are determined to attack his policies, harm his businesses, and, if possible, even keep him out of the coming debates. But they can t silence him. And they sure can t intimidate him. The more they try, the more the public will realize that he s the one telling the truth .",politics,"Mar 7, 2016"
9469,WATCH: ARROGANT Sexual Predator and Sometimes “Comedian” Louis C.K. Tells Stephen Colbert “Donald Trump Is An Insane Bigot and Hitler”,"The not so funny comedian Louis C.K. appeared on the Stephen Colbert show mostly to talk about his decision to send an email to his fans, where he told them that  Donald Trump is an insane bigot and Hitler . After the self-righteous  comedian  got some laughs from Colbert s liberal audience, Colbert asked them to settle down, that Louis C.K. admitted that after he sent the email, he  regretted it.   C.K. went on to say that he didn t really regret it, he just regretted  saying it , or in other words, he regrets that he was outed as a whiny, liberal, crybaby who can t control his emotions (our translation). One of the most interesting lines in the interview came after the Trump bashing where the outed sexual predator tells Colbert,  I wouldn t take it back. If you went back and fixed all the mistakes you made, you erase yourself. You know, there s just no point to that.  Good luck trying to  erase yourself  after you ve been outed creep Here s part of Louis C.K. s email to his fans: Please stop it with voting for Trump. It was funny for a little while. But the guy is Hitler. And by that I mean that we are being Germany in the 30s. Do you think they saw the shit coming? Hitler was just some hilarious and refreshing dude with a weird comb over who would say anything at all.And I m not advocating for Hillary or Bernie. I like them both but frankly I wish the next president was a conservative only because we had Obama for eight years and we need balance. And not because I particularly enjoy the conservative agenda. I just think the government should reflect the people. And we are about 40 percent conservative and 40 percent liberal. When I was growing up and when I was a younger man, liberals and conservatives were friends with differences. They weren t enemies. And it always made sense that everyone gets a president they like for a while and then hates the president for a while. But it only works if the conservatives put up a good candidate. A good smart conservative to face the liberal candidate so they can have a good argument and the country can decide which way to go this time.Trump is not that. He s an insane bigot. He is dangerous.Watch Louis C.K. joke around with Stephen Colbert about his disdain for President Trump, calling him a  Gross crook, dirty, rotten, lying sack of sh*t. The not so funny  comedian  was outed today as a serial sexual predator.NPR reported that Louis C.K. masturbated in front of multiple female colleagues, to their shock and dismay, according to women who spoke on the record to The New York Times about their experiences.The famous comic has been surrounded by rumors of sexual misconduct for years   specifically, allegations that he would masturbate in front of female colleagues.Last year, the comedian Roseanne Barr told The Daily Beast that C.K. was  about to get busted  for his conduct.  It s Louis C.K., locking the door and masturbating in front of women comics and writers. I can t tell you I ve heard so many stories,  she said. Comedian Tig Notaro acknowledged the allegations this summer and said C.K. needed to  handle  them.But previously, those stories were shared secondhand. Now, five women have spoken to the Times directly, with only one requesting anonymity. You can read the full story   which goes into much more detail   over at the New York Times.This Twitter user nailed it when it comes to just how disgusting Louis C.K. really is:Guys like Louis CK could just pay a sex worker. Could even request the sex worker play like she's uncomfortable if they likes. But they don't want that. The pleasure is in the actual discomfort of their victims, the power to overwhelm or make them just take it. It's horrendous.

1470, Did Trump Go Full Nixon? Former Employees Reportedly Saw Him Taping Conversations,"Amateur president Donald Trump sent out a threatening tweet targeting former FBI Director James Comey and it s backfiring. Trump tweeted,  James Comey better hope that there are no  tapes  of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!  Members of Congress have demanded that the former reality show star hand over the alleged tapes for the review. At this moment, team Trump has declined in interviews to address whether tapes exist or not and Comey, for his part, doesn t seem concerned about it. The question over if they exist can be answered by three of Trump s former employees.The former employees and a former associate said it wasn t a surprise to them that Trump would mention taped conversations.The Wall Street Journal reports that Trump sometimes taped phone conversations with associates and others from his Trump Tower office in New York when he was a businessman, according to three people who say they have direct knowledge of the recordings.The former employees said that they were fearful of using their names and another employee said that he had signed a nondisclosure agreement. We do know that the former high-level employees worked for Trump over a span of three decades, so it appears they knew of the goings on at his office and they added that they saw devices in use recording phone calls.It wasn t just three employees.A fourth person said he knew that Mr. Trump had recorded a phone conversation with him because it was later entered into evidence in a lawsuit.During a Fox News interview Friday, Trump was asked whether there might be tape recordings of Comey as he suggested. Trump said,  That I can t talk about. I won t talk about that. Former President Richard Nixon fired Archibald Cox, the special prosecutor assigned to the investigation into his scandal. Sound familiar? The night Cox was fired was called the  Saturday Night Massacre.  Nixon refused Cox s request to release the tapes. Instead, Nixon fired him.Ultimately, Nixon resigned before he could be impeached. The Supreme Court, in a unanimous decision, mandated that the White House release the subpoenaed tapes.The firing of Cox shocked America because it was the first time a president had ever brazenly and abruptly fired an official charged with investigating a president s conduct before. And now it s 2017, and Trump just shocked America by firing the man leading the investigation into his administration s alleged ties to Russia. Before Comey, it was Preet Bharara, then Sally Yates. History repeats itself.It s only a matter of time before we hear Trump say,  I am not a crook! Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images.",News,"May 14, 2017"
17551,JUST IN: ROY MOORE Accuser ADMITS to FORGING Yearbook,"The credibility of Beverly Young Nelson, the woman who accused Roy Moore of making sexual advances toward her when she was a teen, has been shattered.  Shortly after Nelson appeared on television with leftist attorney Gloria Allred,  her stepson made the difficult decision of coming out and saying that his stepmother was lying in a Facebook video he made to set the record straight about his father s wife.Watch video:(function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = 'https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.11';  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));My official statementPosted by Darrel Nelson on Tuesday, November 14, 2017Meanwhile, Twitter user Thomas Wictor made his case through a series of tweets that the alleged Roy Moore signature in a high school yearbook Nelson used as  evidence  of her story was forged. Conservative media outlets began to demand that the yearbook was examined by a neutral party. Nelson and her attorney, Gloria Allred refused. Nelson remained silent for weeks while the controversy about the allegedly forged high school yearbook continued to catch fire in the media.Breitbart News reports that Beverly Young Nelson has finally admitted that she forged a portion of the infamous high school yearbook that she and attorney Gloria Allred used as proof of her accusations against U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore.And in yet another blow to the credibility of ABC News, the disgraced, left-wing network downplayed the bombshell by presenting this admission of forgery as adding  notes  to the inscription. Worse still, the reporter actually coaches Nelson, puts words in her mouth, downplay the enormous significance of her deceit.Beverly Young Nelson, one of the women accusing GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore of sexual misconduct, tells @GMA it  sickens  her to think what might happen if Moore is elected. https://t.co/wuEGWr0kng pic.twitter.com/lcp5OY4x3A  ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) December 8, 2017 Nelson admits she did make notes to the inscription,  ABC News tells us.  But the message was all Roy Moore. ABC News reporter Tom Llamas just couldn t help himself, as he coaches Nelson to make sure she is still able to cling to a portion of her story:Llamas:  Beverly, he signed your yearbook. Nelson:  He did sign it. Llamas, for his part encouraged her to get her story straight:  And you made some notes underneath. Nelson replied:  Yes. And then, after a woman admits to forging a document used in a campaign to destroy the Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate in Alabama, ABC News quickly moves on as though it is not news of extraordinary consequence.Llamas also fails to ask any follow-ups, such as  If the explanation is this simple, why wait all these weeks to offer it?  Or,  Why did you lie? Nelson is accusing Moore of attempting to assault her when she was just 16-years-old. With the election just four days away, this admission of forgery could not come at a better time for Moore. Nelson and Allred are planning a news conference Friday, but nothing will overcome the forgery admission.How can anyone believe anything she says after admitting to such a thing? Early reports are that Nelson and Allred will produce an expert to prove the rest of the yearbook is not a forgery. So a proven forger is bringing in her own expert. What an insult to the people of Alabama.Another problem with Nelson is that she has a motive to lie and forge: as a circuit judge, Moore ruled against her in a 1999 divorce case.The Moore campaign has been pressuring Nelson and Allred for weeks to submit the yearbook for independent handwriting analysis. Now everyone knows why that request was rejected and ignored.With Nelson now thoroughly discredited, this leaves two accusers against Moore.One is Leigh Corfman, who claims Moore molested her as a 14-year-old child. She is the most credible of the three, but the narrative behind her story, that Moore s abuse resulted in Corfman s living a troubled life of  drinking, drugs, boyfriends, and a suicide attempt,  is directly contradicted by contemporaneous court records.Moore s final accuser is Tina Johnson, a woman who claims Moore groped her butt in his office in 1991. But, again, as was the case with Corfman and Nelson, the left-wing media outlets reporting these allegations (the Washington Post, AL.com) either failed to fully vet the accusers or withheld crucial context.Thanks to New Media s going behind these discredited outlets to fact check the reporting, we now know that Johnson did not tell the entire truth. She was not in Moore s office  on business.  If she was in Moore s office at all, it was due to a bitter custody battle where Moore represented Johnson s mother, who was trying to gain custody of Johnson s 12-year-old son based on the claim that Johnson was an  unfit, absent, and unstable mother. If the media and the accusers and Gloria Allred told the full truth to begin with, they would all be more credible.Here are close up versions of the signatures. Note, that when viewed close up, the signature is signed in both black and blue ink.Here is a closer version of the yearbook signature:Here is Wictor s explanation for the different colors of ink:(4) The LIGHT is reflecting off of the ink.The ink that LOOKS blue is actually black. It's DIFFERENT ink than the ORIGINAL ink.Therefore it reflects light differently.  Thomas Wictor (@ThomasWictor) November 16, 2017(11) So, to recap:The signature is a forgery, and everything after the name ""Roy-Ray"" was added later with different ink. pic.twitter.com/1sPv6aABge  Thomas Wictor (@ThomasWictor) November 15, 2017Just like the ""TH"" doomed Dan Rather, ""DA"" will doom the anti Roy Moore forces. They copied his signature on Nelsons divorce order not realizing ""DA"" was his assistants initials, not his title. The sheer stupidity! pic.twitter.com/oWJ5fzM6fr  TruthHurts (@tru768) November 15, 2017After the yearbook signature came into question, Moore s attorney came out  with a statement regarding the signature in the high school yearbook. Here s what he had to say:Roy Moore's Attorney: ""[Nelson & Gloria Allred] said that Ms. Nelson after the allegations had never seen or had any contact with Judge Moore  In 1999, Ms. Nelson filed a divorce action  The judge assigned was Roy S. Moore."" pic.twitter.com/Bv5ZV0CMvc  Fox News (@FoxNews) November 15, 2017",left-news,"Dec 8, 2017"
6204, Conservative Heads EXPLODE After Obama Appoints Transgender Woman To Faith-Based Council (SCREENSHOTS),"President Barack Obama made history when he appointed a Christian Air Force veteran to the President s Advisory Council on Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships. Since conservatives love our troops, this is a move that they widely celebrat oh, wait   they have a problem with it.Satin is quite successful; she served as a member of the United Church of Christ s executive council with great success. In fact, she is the first openly transgender member of the UCC executive council, and was involved in the church s decision to include transgender individuals in the ministry of the church. Of course, her successes are the reason conservatives hate her. The White House notes that:Barbara Satin is the Assistant Faith Work Director for the National LGBTQ Task Force.  She is an active member of the United Church of Christ and served on the denomination s Executive Council as its first openly transgender member.  Ms. Satin recently worked on the development of Spirit on Lake, a LGBTQ senior housing project in Minneapolis.  She served on the Board of Directors for OutFront Minnesota from 2001 to 2008 and has served as Chair of GLBT Generations since 1999.  She has also served on the Board of Directors of PFund Foundation, a regional LGBTQ community foundation advancing social justice in Iowa, Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wisconsin, since 2013. Given the current political climate, I believe it s important that a voice of faith representing the transgender and gender non-conforming community   as well as a person of my years, nearly 82   be present and heard in these vital conversations,  Satin said in a statement after the President selected her for her new position.The mission of the President s Advisory Council on Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships, which  brings together leaders and experts in fields related to the work of faith-based and neighborhood organizations in order to make recommendations to the Administration on how to improve the partnerships it forms to serve people in need,  is quite admirable.But conservatives just can t get past that whole  transgender  thing. In the comment section of The Blaze, our frenemies on the Right really let their hatred flow. Some complained that Obama appointed a  dude  (the only time in their lives in which they were angry about a white man being appointed to an important position),                Satin is a good woman who served her country honorably in the military and continues to do so.

17084,POPE MAKES VISIT TO NUNS OBAMA REGIME IS SUING For Not Conforming To Obamacare Contraception Mandate,"Leave it to our Community Organizer In Chief to bully nuns who ve committed their lives to helping the poor in our country over a contraception mandateIf Obama s rules apply to these nuns why don t they apply to the tens of millions who are living in the United States illegally?  Pope Francis paid a short visit to the Little Sisters of the Poor community in Washington, D.C. on Wednesday to support them in their court case over the contraception mandate, the Vatican s spokesman revealed.It was a  short visit that was not in the program,  Father Federico Lombardi, director of the Holy See Press Office, said at an evening press conference during the papal visit to the nation s capital. This is a sign, obviously, of support for them  in their court case, he affirmed.The sisters have filed a lawsuit against the Obama administration for its 2012 mandate that employers provide insurance coverage for birth control, sterilizations, and drugs that can cause abortions in employee health plans. The sisters have maintained that to provide this coverage would violate their religious beliefs.Even after the Obama administration modified the rules as an  accommodation  for objecting organizations, the sisters held that the revised rules would force them to violate their consciences.The majority of a three-judge panel for the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in July that the Little Sisters of the Poor did not establish that the mandate was a  substantial burden  on their free exercise of religion, and thus ruled they still had to abide by the mandate.The papal visit was not on the official schedule for Pope Francis  Washington, D.C. visit, which included Wednesday visits to the White House, a midday prayer service with the U.S. bishops at St. Matthew s Cathedral, and the canonization mass for St. Junipero Serra at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception.It was a  little addition to the program, but I think it has an important meaning,  Fr. Lombardi said.He added that the visit  is connected  to  the words that the Pope has said in support of the position of the bishops of the United States in the speech to President Obama and also in the speech to the bishops. Pope Francis, with President Obama at the White House, called religious freedom  one of America s most precious possessions  and had hearkened to the U.S. bishops  defense of religious freedom.  All are called to be vigilant, precisely as good citizens, to preserve and defend that freedom from everything that would threaten or compromise it,  he had said.In response to the news of the visit with the sisters, Archbishop Joseph Kurtz of Louisville, president of the U.S. Bishops Conference, said that he was  so pleased  to hear of the visit. As you know the last thing the Little Sisters of the Poor want to do is sue somebody. They don t want to sue in court,  he insisted.  They simply want to serve people who are poor and elderly, and they want to do it in a way that doesn t conflict with their beliefs.Via: Catholic News Agency",Government News,"Sep 24, 2015"
1180, WATCH: Elizabeth Warren Sets The Internet On FIRE By Dancing Through The Streets At Boston Pride,"Donald Trump has chosen to ignore Pride month, but the same can not be said of all politicians. Sen. Elizabeth Warren set the internet on fire this weekend when she was caught on video literally dancing through the streets at the Boston Pride parade.The Massachusetts Democrat celebrated LGBT Pride along with tens of thousands of others at the 47th annual Boston Pride parade and the scene could not have been any more perfect. And this is a prime example of exactly why she has become a liberal icon. I love pride,  Warren says in the short video she posted.  It may be my single most favorite day of the year   because it s the day that we all come together and celebrate. Go pride. It is worth noting that not only has Trump chosen to ignore Pride month, but he has decided it isn t even worth a passing mention after the Supreme Court ruled in favor of marriage equality and after the deadly massacre at Pulse. That pretty much says it all right there, doesn t it?He claims to be an inclusive leader and has said that he stands by the LGBT community, but clearly, that is not the case. Actions speak louder than words, and so far, he has offered neither this month.Warren, on the other hand, is the polar opposite of Trump and that couldn t make us any happier. Her joy at this weekend s event was absolutely infectious and the internet just can t get enough of her. (Or her rainbow feather boa!) This is exactly why we liberals love her so much!You can see the video of Sen. Warren dancing along the route of the parade, here:I LOVE the Boston Pride Parade.

Mayor Weaver is currently embroiled in a lawsuit after former City Administrator Natasha Henderson blew the whistle on her for allegedly trying to steer money from a charity for local families into a campaign fund. Henderson claims she was wrongfully fired for blowing the whistle on Hillary s loyal minion, the mayor of the city of Flint. Donald Trump will be visiting the broken, violent city of Flint today, where he plans to visit a church and the Flint Water Treatment Plant.  But one of Hillary s biggest cheerleaders won t be throwing out the welcome mat Flint Mayor Karen Weaver says she s baffled by the visit, and didn t receive a call from Trump s campaign ahead of time.Does Trump need to get clearance from Hillary s  de facto  Flint campaign manager before he can visit a violent and broken city that s been destroyed for decades by Democrats?  I would think, if you are very concerned about Flint and the people, you would contact the mayor and want to have a conversation about what s going on   so that puts a question mark in my mind that I wasn t even contacted or notified about something today about something tomorrow,  says Weaver.Weaver is in Washington D.C. and will not be in Flint during Trump s visit. I had not been notified by Donald Trump or his people   finally, this afternoon, a call to my press person, but I did not know. These plans were made without contacting me. Her reaction when she was contacted by Trump s campaign? That s kind of not the way it s supposed to go   I wish that he had come when things were in more dire straits   maybe before we had even received help   when the debates were going on. We were crying out for a long time. The fact that Trump didn t rush to Flint, MI for a photo-op when Hillary and Bernie were making regular visits as part of their pandering for the Black vote effort in a city ignored for decades by Democrats, speaks volumes about Trump s serious nature. Americans are getting to see firsthand how a successful businessman approaches serious issues vs. how a career politician promises to fix issues with no real plan to ever come back once the press packs it up and leaves these broken neighborhoods. Trump s desire to create jobs for people who have been unemployed for decades is real and the Democrats biggest fear is that his message is resonating in these forgotten neighborhoods.

4711," In Brilliant Op-Ed, Hillary Clinton Opens Up About Her Flaws","Hillary Clinton is far from the perfect politician. She sometimes comes across as cold, as unemotional. She, unlike her opponent, though, is perfectly aware of her flaws and in a deeply moving op-ed in the Humans of New York blog, Clinton opens up about her flaws and about being a woman in what s still a man s world.If anyone is demonstrating the double standard between women and men, it s Clinton s opponent, Donald Trump, who just this week said that Clinton doesn t have  a presidential look.  Yeah, we know what that means. Or how about the people who are criticizing Clinton for not smiling enough? Could you imagine that happening with a man?By this time, Clinton is used to the double standard, but it does make it tougher for the most qualified presidential candidate in decades to compete. In the article in Humans of New York, Clinton talked about her history and about how hard she works at not appearing too feminine.She relayed a story about law school, and how hard she worked to learn to control her emotions. She also recognizes that she comes across as cold and unemotional because of that. I had to learn as a young woman to control my emotions. And that s a hard path to walk. Because you need to protect yourself, you need to keep steady, but at the same time you don t want to seem  walled off.  And sometimes I think I come across more in the  walled off  arena. And if I create that perception, then I take responsibility. I don t view myself as cold or unemotional. And neither do my friends. And neither does my family. But if that sometimes is the perception I create, then I can t blame people for thinking that. As for the inevitable comparisons with Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, well, she knows she doesn t have their charisma. She also sees how hard they work on it. I m not Barack Obama. I m not Bill Clinton. Both of them carry themselves with a naturalness that is very appealing to audiences. But I m married to one and I ve worked for the other, so I know how hard they work at being natural. It s not something they just dial in. They work and they practice what they re going to say. It s not that they re trying to be somebody else. But it s hard work to present yourself in the best possible way. She also notes that there are very few role models for women in politics and that Obama s and her husband s type of charisma doesn t work for women.It s a double-edged sword. Clinton is accused of being stiff, but if she s animated, things get even worse. But I ve learned that I can t be quite so passionate in my presentation. I love to wave my arms, but apparently that s a little bit scary to people. And I can t yell too much. It comes across as  too loud  or  too shrill  or  too this  or  too that.  Which is funny, because I m always convinced that the people in the front row are loving it. If Clinton wins, some of these double standards might start drifting away, but it s still a misogynistic world. A woman president won t solve misogyny any more than an African-American president solved racism. It s a societal problem, but for those who don t consider themselves sexist, perhaps it s time to take a good hard look at your criticisms of Clinton.

This may be the shocker of all shockers, but it s completely made up.Before right-wing pundits popped the corks on their champagne bottles, this lie was uttered by Fox News  Bret Baier, who claimed that  two separate sources with intimate knowledge of the FBI investigations  ha confirmed not only that the  Clinton Foundation investigation is far more expansive than anybody has reported so far  but that  there is a lot of evidence  and that the sources say it will end in  likely an indictment. This would be a bombshell revelation   if it were true. On Thursday, however, Baier explained that his claims were  inartful :MARTHA MACCALLUM (CO-HOST): The FBI sources that you spoke with suggest that an indictment is likely. That would prove   go ahead.BRET BAIER: I want to be clear   I want to be clear about this, and this was   came from a Q and A that I did with Brit Hume after my show and after we went through everything. He asked me if, after the election, if Hillary Clinton wins, will this investigation continue, and I said,  yes absolutely.  I pressed the sources again and again what would happen. I got to the end of that and said,  they have a lot of evidence that would, likely lead to an indictment.  But that s not, that s inartfully answered. That s not the process. That s not how you do it. You have to have a prosecutor. If they don t move forward with a prosecutor with the DOJ, there would be, I m told, a very public call for an independent prosecutor to move forward. There is confidence in the evidence, but for me to phrase it like I did, of course that got picked up everywhere, but the process is different than that.That s his way of saying he was lying.

A University of Michigan survey in May found that leaders of environmental groups are overwhelmingly white males, with ethnic minorities occupying fewer than 12% of leadership positions.The environmental groups that are calling for sweeping changes to the economy   moving away from oil and coal to carbon-free sources of energy   seem incapable of making a transition themselves. These almost exclusively white groups are helping to fund Hillary s campaign while stealing the livelihood of hard-working black American coal miners and Blacks in the communities who s livelihood depends on the coal industry.Take a look at the top executives at eight of the top 10 groups devoted to fighting that fight:Sierra Club?

But their wages were still high by national standards: $118.30 per month, according to one 1929 survey. By contrast, a national study in 1939 later found that black men earned an average income of $460 per year.By the 1950s, African Americans made up 24 percent of McDowell s population, compared with 6 percent statewide. Locals came to refer to the area as  the Free State of McDowell.  Black doctors, lawyers and entrepreneurs also flocked to the county, drawn to the promise of a better life. Even in the Jim Crow era, unions in the area were integrated, blacks in West Virginia enjoyed voting rights, and local political leadership included many people of color. Everybody had money,  says Clif Moore, a current state delegate for McDowell who was born in the county in 1949.  It was sort of like little New York. Like a little Manhattan. Everything was popping. But at mid-century, as machines began to take over the tasks of drilling and blasting coal and hauling it above ground, black miners were the first to lose their jobs. What had once been an all but certain gateway to the middle class began to close. African Americans fled the industry at even higher rates than whites; by 1960, the share of black workers in coal shrank to 6.6 from 12 percent a decade earlier. In 2014, the most recent year for which Bureau of Labor Statistics data are available, only about 2,500 blacks worked as coal miners, less than 3 percent of the total.Coal has seen booms and busts before, but for locals, this time feels different. Production in Appalachia fell last year by 13 percent (and 10 percent nationwide) as tougher environmental regulations and cheaper natural gas choked off demand for the highly polluting fossil fuel. Last month, the Obama administration announced a moratorium on new coal leases on public lands. Many of the area s mines have closed. Shops are often empty; drug use is rampant. McDowell is now West Virginia s poorest county.Still, families who ve lived here for generations say they re reluctant to leave. They praise the region s physical beauty, close-knit family life and friendly Southern manners.  It s a different kind of black folk here.   They dress differently, they talk differently, they carry themselves differently. They have a little arrogance about them,  says Moore with a grin.Wade, like others here, harbors particular resentment for the Obama administration.  He hasn t done anything for us,  says the 88-year-old, leaning back on a couch in his living room overlooking the mountains.  If he were running again, I just couldn t vote for him. And I ve been a Democrat my whole life. When Wade first started in the mines, Franklin D. Roosevelt was president. It was a dangerous gig, but Wade didn t worry much about safety, even after his brother nearly died in a motor accident underground and his father lost an eye in a roof collapse. Wade says he didn t witness much discrimination, either.  I had some of the nicest white friends that you would ever want to meet. He got involved in the mine s union, serving as president, and later took a job with the United Mine Workers of America. From 2005 to 2011, after his retirement, he also served as mayor of Keystone. But while he cared about local politics, his heart was in the mines. Even today, Wade drives the 30 minutes to the union offices once a week just to say hello.For Jeremy McMillian, 25, working in the mines was difficult at first. He was one of just 13 black employees among roughly 400 at the Pinnacle Mine in Pineville, West Virginia, he says. Occasionally, people directed racial slurs his way, but more often, they simply ignored him.  People not talking to you, just walking by you like you re invisible,  says McMillian.  It s been days I wanted to snap, go crazy. They ll push your buttons. But over five years of running a coal buggy in and out of the mine, he gradually grew close to some colleagues.  I can t blame them. Their parents taught them that. McMillian never thought he d be a coal miner. His father was a cop, and his stepdad, who raised him, owned a roofing business. No one in high school had ambitions to work in the mines unless their fathers did, so McMillian never expected to end up there. In fact, he was afraid of the mines. He d heard of coal workers  pneumoconiosis, more commonly known as black lung. (A recent report found that after near eradication 15 years ago, black lung has resurged as coal miners work longer hours, often in dirtier conditions.) And he didn t think it was a profession welcome to black people. So after high school, he found a job as a mechanic.But when a father of a friend, a white man who d worked in the mines for 32 years, told him he could earn six figures as a coal miner, McMillian signed on. His health concerns haven t evaporated, though. You can make $100,00 a year,  he says.  They pay you that much because it s a dangerous job.  Each time a shift of workers prepares to go underground, he says, they pray together.  All I can do and pray [is that] it ain t my last day in the mines. His wife, a cheerleading coach at the local high school, is ready for him to quit. But there aren t many other jobs available. He has two children to provide for   a 7-year-old daughter and 7-month-old girl. He s studying for his roofing license so he can take over his stepfather s business one day. But he plans to keep working in coal as long as it s viable.That may not be long. In October, his employer, Cliffs Natural Resources, announced it was laying off more than 200 people   roughly half its staff   at the Pinnacle Mine. McMillian kept his job, but his overtime hours were capped, costing him about $2,300 a month, he says. He was relieved, though, to still have a job.McMillian says he s frustrated that so many national politicians seem to be turning against coal.  We don t like Obama  cause he don t like us,  he says. Instead, he may vote for Donald Trump:  He talk a good game,  McMillian says.  We ll see if he stick to it. I mean, who wouldn t want to pay less taxes?  He says he pays up to $2,400 a month in state and federal taxes on his monthly salary, which ranges from $4,000 to $4,500, depending on his hours.Two days before New Year s, McMillian was laid off. But as he was making plans to start a job as a truck driver hauling cars and heavy equipment cross-country, he was called back to the mines. He s happy to be back at work, for now. But he imagines he ll soon have to give up coal for trucking.With her long, black dreadlocks; warm smile; and Trinidadian accent, Janice Martin, 62, doesn t look or sound like a typical coal miner. She arrived in McDowell County in the late 1970s when her then-husband returned to his home state to find work in the lucrative coal industry.Following her mother s counsel, Martin searched for a job too. The mines seemed an obvious place to look. But she was shut out.  They said women were not allowed in the coal mines because they thought it was bad luck,  says Martin. But a few years later, after equal opportunity laws forced the mines to hire women, she tried again. This time she was successful and soon was one of the first five women hired at U.S. Steel Co. Mine Number 9 in Gary, West Virginia.At Mine 9, Martin was a mason. She laid blocks and built stoppings to aid air ventilation for $10 an hour, a good salary for a man or woman. She didn t mind the work, but the male-dominated culture could be demoralizing.  They cuss, and they make dirty jokes, and they make women jokes, and they make black jokes, and they make Polish jokes. I mean, that s how life is, and you have to get used to it.  But none of the jokes were personal, Martin says, and she never felt disrespected.Nearly 40 years later, she s still employed in the coal industry, as the only female (or African-American) mine inspector for the state of West Virginia, covering McDowell and a few other counties. She loves her work but believes even bigger job losses are about to hit.  These communities are dying   slowly,  she says.  People are moving out of these areas, and they aren t coming back. As she drives through McDowell in her beige GMC truck, the Trinidadian flag flying from the mirror, she points with sadness and frustration to the retail stores and government buildings that have shut down in recent years   cleaners, banks, grocery stories, a school. The industry s decline is also hitting her at home. Martin once hoped her 19-year-old daughter, Jazzlee, would work in the mines, but instead she s studying to be a welder.  I raised her that she was going to be in the mines, but the mines dropped drastically; there is no future in mining now. Via: Al Jazeera America",politics,"Oct 11, 2016"

17198,EXPLODING AFRICAN REFUGEE POPULATION STRESSING WELFARE SYSTEM IN MINNESOTA Are Sending Millions Of Dollars Back To Africa,"It s not just the our open southern borders we need to be concerned about. It s our State Department who seems to be hell-bent on populating our states with refugees from mostly muslim nations in Africa and the Middle East.This is one of those feel-good stories about how Minnesota is such a wonderful state with its ever-expanding African migrant population. If you are a Minnesotan it s probably a good thing to read.However, I caution readers on the numbers. The TwinCities Pioneer Press reports that there are about 85,000 Somalis in the whole US and that just isn t so the number is much larger. We painstakingly researched the numbers for just those entering the US through the refugee program and came up with over 100,000 in the last 25 years and that doesn t include a couple generations now of producing children. See this early post.You will see mention in the story that when census takers come around, the Africans are less than truthful about how many are living at the location.From TwinCities Pioneer Press:Of the 50 states, Minnesota has the ninth-largest population of African immigrants. About 60 percent come from East African nations such as Somalia and Ethiopia, and 25 percent from West African nations such as Nigeria and Liberia. The rest come from elsewhere in Africa.Of more than 85,700 Somalis officially known to reside in the U.S., nearly a third are thought to reside in Minnesota.Corrie, a professor at Concordia University in St. Paul, believes the state s African population produces $14 million in philanthropy within Minnesota each year, on top of $150 million in annual remittances to countries in Africa.I don t know why this is considered a good thing sending money out of America that will never benefit our economy!Some of the  smart  people on our side should get to work doing studies that will show the real picture including how much welfare is consumed by the immigrants, how costly is their medical care and education, the cost to the criminal justice system, and include an analysis of where the money goes!I m starting to think that glowing reports about how immigrants benefit the local economy include the money flowing into a state like Minnesota from the federal tax payer via welfare programs. Someone needs to find out!By the way, I don t see any mention in the Pioneer Press story about the fact that half of the state s Somalis live in poverty, here. Via: Refugee Resettlement WatchThe State Department has helped to relocate tens of thousands of refugees from the war-torn African nation of Somalia to Minnesota, where they can take advantage of some of America s most generous welfare and charity programs.But the effort is having the unintended consequence of creating an enclave of immigrants with high unemployment that is both stressing the state s safety net and creating a rich pool of potential recruiting targets for Islamist terror groups.

11093,THE VIEW Brings On Bill O’Reilly’s Sexual Harassment Accuser…Is This REALLY Sexual Harassment? [Video],"The last accuser who could have been the nail in the coffin for Bill O Reilly spoke on The View about her sexual harassment lawsuit. Perquita Burgess and her lawyer were on The View for their 15 minutes of fame. Attorney Lisa Bloom should know better than to send her client on to speak out about her allegations. Lisa Bloom has a track record as a high profile lawyer for cases like this She should know better but it could be that she s trying to gain sympathy for her client.Please listen to the video and let us know what you think about what she said and about sexual harassment in the workplace:O Reilly settled with other women over sexual harassment but how do we know if any of them has any credibility? How does a man protect himself from such charges?If this could be brought up on charges, then every high profile man out there needs a witness when he walks around anywhere.Are the comments (if true) that this woman said Bill O Reilly made considered sexual harassment to you? What exactly is sexual harassment? If it s how you feel then men are in big trouble because of all of the  offended  women out there. Should the definition be broader or should it be more narrowly defined. We feel with our litigious society, the cases for sexual harassment should be very closely scrutinized.

4624, ‘Christian’ Pastor Gets BUSTED In Arizona For Molesting Children For Decades,"An Arizona pastor used his position to get close to children for decades so he could rape them   and now he has finally been arrested by law enforcement.Jose Vicente Morales of the Iglesia Impacto De Fe church in Phoenix was arrested at his home on September 9th and charged with sexual abuse, child molestation and sexual conduct with a minor, one of whom he  married  when the girl was 10 years old and impregnated when she was 13 years old.According to ABC 15:Court records show that 49-year-old Jose Vicente Morales had been molesting children for years; he impregnated one of the victims when she was 13 years of age.In the ongoing investigation, police report Morales may have molested or sexually assaulted at least five victims who were either church members or known to Morales outside of the church setting.Multiple victims have come forward, including a teen who says the pastor lured her into a home and and sexually assaulted her and another who says he molested her from the time she was seven until she turned 12.Thus far, Morales  church has not responded to the arrest and charges.But when they finally get around to doing so, hopefully they will not blame the victims like the Columbia Road Baptist Church in North Olmsted, Ohio did earlier this month when they demanded that a teenage girl apologize to the wife of the youth pastor who raped her repeatedly.Churches are an easy target for rapists and pedophiles because working in that setting, especially as a pastor, provides them instant access to potential victims who are more likely to trust them.That s why it is so important for churches to perform background checks and for parishioners to be cautious. Not all pastors are predators, but these incidents have happened far too often to trust someone entirely.Featured image via Wikimedia",News,"September 15, 2016"
5782, Pastor Who Prayed For Deaths Of Orlando Survivors Just Got Kicked Out Of His Building,"Pastor Roger Jimenez made national news after the most recent mass shooting at a gay night club in Orlando when he decided to share what God thinks on the matter   specifically that more  sodomites  should be dead. Unfortunately for him, his god is a spiteful one who doesn t like people putting words in his mouth   or Jiminez is simply an intolerant person whom a civilized society will not tolerate. In any case, the good pastor just got some very, very bad news.After the shooting, Jimenez made some remarks that were horrifying even by right-wing  Christian  standards, explaining that the country shouldn t be mourning the death of 50 sodomites. People say, like:  Well, aren t you sad that 50 sodomites died?    Jimenez continued in his ravings.  Here s the problem with that. It s like the equivalent of asking me  what if you asked me:  Hey, are you sad that 50 pedophiles were killed today? Um, no, I think that s great. I think that helps society. You know, I think Orlando, Fla., is a little safer tonight,  he concluded, adding that he s upset more didn t die: The tragedy is that more of them didn t die. The tragedy is   I m kind of upset that he didn t finish the job! The remarks were universally condemned, even by some of the more extreme elements on the right who have not completely lost their sense of humanity. And now, Jimenez is looking for a new place to hold his hate group meetings church services. WMAZ reports that the property management company and owner of the building which Verity Baptist Church calls home will not be renewing Jimenez s lease:The property management company and owner of the building in which Verity Baptist Church and its Pastor Roger Jimenez preside have decided not to renew the church s lease, and have asked church officials to consider moving.Under the terms of the lease, Jimenez cannot simply be evicted, but the company says it can not tolerate tenants who advocate hatred and the taking of innocent lives. We have many places of worship and other religious organizations in the properties we manage,  company officials said in a press release.  Like all our tenants, their occupancy rights are protected in their leases. But, of course, that won t be an issue once the lease is up in March of 2017, and Jimenez and his hateful friends are told to put their boots to the pavement. If Jimenez leaves early, his lease will be canceled without any penalty. Just as we respect the right of individuals to speak their views, as distasteful as they may be, we also respect the right of others to protest as a reflection of their values,  the company says. For decades, the owners and staff at Harsch Investment Properties have supported the LGBT community and many other organizations whose missions are to further respect, dignity and the ability for all individuals to live their lives as they wish. Jimenez is an ideological clone of Tempe Arizona s Pastor Stephen Anderson, who also made some rather horrific remarks about the massacre. Anderson didn t even wait for the bodies to grow cold before he posted a gleeful and celebratory message on YouTube in which he said it was  good news  that 50  f*ggots    a group he, too, calls pedophiles without any evidence   died. At least these dangerous predators, these dangerous filthy pedophiles at this gay bar, at least they re off the streets,  Anderson, who leads Faithful Word Baptist Church, said. Jimenez has guest preached at Faithful Word on multiple occasions.Watch the pastor s hateful rant below:Featured image via screengrab",News,"June 21, 2016"
21579,15 YR OLDS IN THIS STATE CAN NOW GET STATE FUNDED SEX-CHANGE OPERATION WITHOUT PARENTAL CONSENT…But Need Consent To Use Tanning Bed,"The left has officially taken parenting out of our hands via legislation and handed it over to our government The list of things 15-year-olds are not legally allowed to do in Oregon is long: Drive, smoke, donate blood, get a tattoo   even go to a tanning bed.But, under a first-in-the-nation policy quietly enacted in January that many parents are only now finding out about, 15-year-olds are now allowed to get a sex-change operation. Many residents are stunned to learn they can do it without parental notification   and the state will even pay for it through its Medicaid program, the Oregon Health Plan. It is trespassing on the hearts, the minds, the bodies of our children,  said Lori Porter of Parents  Rights in Education.  They re our children. And for a decision, a life-altering decision like that to be done unbeknownst to a parent or guardian, it s mindboggling. In a statement, Oregon Health Authority spokeswoman Susan Wickstrom explained it this way:  Age of medical consent varies by state. Oregon law   which applies to both Medicaid and non-Medicaid Oregonians   states that the age of medical consent is 15. While 15 is the medical age of consent in the state, the decision to cover sex-change operations specifically was made by the Health Evidence Review Commission (HERC).Members are appointed by the governor and paid by the state of Oregon. With no public debate, HERC changed its policy to include cross-sex hormone therapy, puberty-suppressing drugs and gender-reassignment surgery as covered treatments for people with gender dysphoria, formally known as gender identity disorder.HERC officials refused repeated requests by Fox News for an interview and even gave Fox News inaccurate information about the medical director s work schedule.Oregon Health Authority officials directed Fox News to their website. It shows transgender policy was discussed at four meetings in 2014. It was passed without any opposition or even discussion about teenagers  new access to undergoing a sex change.Gender dysphoria is classified by the American Psychiatric Association as a mental disorder in which a person identifies as the sex opposite of his or her birth. It is rare, affecting one out of every 20,000 males and one out of every 50,000 females.According to a 2008 study published in the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry,  most children with gender dysphoria will not remain gender dysphoric after puberty. Dr. Paul McHugh, who led the Johns Hopkins Psychiatry Department and still practices, said Oregon s policy amounts to child abuse.  We have a very radical and even mutilating treatment being offered to children without any evidence that the long-term outcome of this would be good,  McHugh said.Dr. Jack Drescher, a member of the APA who worked on the Sexual and Gender Identity Disorders Work Group, says treatment for gender dysphoria has received a lot more attention in recent years. He said this year New York changed its policy to cover cross-sex hormone drugs and sex-reassignment surgery for Medicaid recipients who are at least 18 years old. He thinks Oregon is offering the treatment too early. Children age 15 may not fully understand all the consequences of the procedures they are undergoing,  he said.Jenn Burleton disagrees. She underwent a sex-reassignment surgery and started the Portland non-profit group TransActive. She said requiring parental consent would lead to more suffering and teen suicide attempts. Parents may not be supportive,  Burleton said.  They may not be in an environment where they feel the parent will affirm their identity, this may have been going on for years. The science is unsettled. A 2010 Murad study concluded  very low quality evidence suggests sex reassignment   improves gender dysphoria and overall quality of life.  The authors admitted the evidence was  sparse and inconclusive. Lisa Maloney, a parent and Scappoose, Ore., School Board member, is outraged. To know that taxpayers are now on the hook for that, that a child can do that without their parent s knowledge or information or consent, parents have absolutely no say, that s appalling,  Maloney said.The Oregon Health Authority could not say how many Medicaid recipients have been treated for gender dysphoria since the new policy took effect in January. Oregon has 935,000 people enrolled in the Oregon Health Plan. HERC assumes between 14 and 112 of them may be gender dysphoric. It estimates the total cost of adding cross-sex hormone therapy, puberty-suppressing drugs and sex reassignment surgeries to the coverage will be no more than $150,000 per year.But HERC also believes the state will save money due to fewer suicide attempts. It estimates there will be one less suicide attempt per year. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates the average cost per suicide attempt in the U.S. is $7,234.But Dr. McHugh says a sex-change operation, especially for young people with gender dysphoria, is never appropriate. We can help them if we begin to explore with them and their families what they re fearing about development, what they re fearing about being a young boy, a young adolescent appropriate to themselves.

22859,4th of July: Why the Shadow Government Hates Independence Day,"SARTRE 21st Century WireThe only conclusion any honest American citizen can come to is that the Republic is dead. Once again the flags wave and the songs play as the parades march to celebrate another 4th of July.Picnic meals are eaten while children frolic in the warn sunshine of summer. Few people reflect on the true meaning that established the solemn commemoration of the nation s birth. The reality of this post federation of independent state sovereignty is that a centralized federal behemoth has superseded the original intent of Thomas Jefferson s vision: That government is best which governs least .Today the society that exists demands compliance or compels obedience by way of punishment.The empire that emerged after World War II has established an Amerika Imperium. With the consistent dumbing down of the youth, indoctrinated in government schools and the mind control impact from the mass media, the culture has abandoned the timeless principles that our country was founded upon.In the essay, Independence Day for Whom?, the struggle for freedom and liberty was fought against the British empire. Most citizens acclaim this revolution as the greatest achievement of a besieged population. Ponder just how far the promises from a rebellion of Englishmen has deteriorated into a dumping ground for foreigners, who do not believe in the values and responsibilities upon which this struggle was fought.For a more precise view of The Meaning of Independence Day, the true reasons for waging a war to create a beacon of hope in the New World has a history that fewer people understand, much less devote their allegiance to its preservation.Just how has a country of freedom loving patriots allowed the systematic destruction of their once beloved nation? A primer on some of the reasons for this betrayal can be reviewed in the End of Independence Day essay. With the internationalism of foreign policy, the traditional America First viewpoint of the Founding Fathers was abandoned.The end result is that The Death of Independence, is now upon us. Over the decades, a replacement aristocracy emerged that transplanted the elected representation of the public will. The real control behind the legislative office holders and certainly the executive branch under any president, demonstrate that ignoring the canons within the Declaration of Independence is a prime requirement to wield power in Washington DC.Frustrated and disenfranchised citizens voted for Donald Trump based upon his articulation on the issues that genuine patriots would support. No matter what anyone thinks of the man or believes about the inordinate attacks directed at him and his administration, the indisputable fact is that the establishment wants to see him fail.Simply put, the actual rulers of the global supremacy wants the financial dominance of the central banking system to continue and perfect their governance. Amerika is pivotal in maintaining their forced submission. The basis of the Shadow Government surreptitiously functions in the darkness of public exposure.Routing out any effort or initiative for independent representation is the standard modus operandi. The populace is generally ignorant of the existence of this empowerment cabal. People are led to believe that the Deep State is simply the technocrats that never leave their positions of administrating agencies. Regretfully, it is not realistic to facilitate a clean sweep of the careerists who routinely sabotage any directive that compromises the interests of the permanent bureaucracies and their masters.Trump may prove to be a dragon slayer, but the hatching of genetically rotten eggs continues. The column,  Can the Swamp Really be Drained? addresses this issue. The single most persistent element that drives authorities away from the maxims of the American Revolution, centers within the attitude that government acts in the interests of the people.Such deficiencies in understanding of the vile nature and the actual record of coercive regimes, stands as a major obstacle to the liberation of the mind. Rejecting the legitimacy of the criminal syndicate that purports to be the lawful authority is essential.Examine the book review,  American Amnesia the Liberal Case for Government, which debunks the lunacy that rationalizes the worship of government control over society. Such a demented academic viewpoint logically concludes that the celebration of Independence Day must be based upon the triumph of the all powerful  leviathan government over a decentralized autonomous and local accountable authority.Authentic nationalism must rest upon the pillars of individual liberty. When the 4th of July becomes a cartoon carnival of the Deep State, the only beneficiary is the Shadow Government.President Trump is not the cause nor is he the solution to reinstitute an American Renaissance Revolution. However, to the degree that he can raise the consciousness within the country, his presence in the oval office becomes a peril to the comrades, who want to destroy our national independence.When the hypocrites from the political class and the treachery from the fake news purveyors is confronted, then and only then, will a real independence celebration become a true national commemoration.The enemy is not just at the gate, they have become the jailers for the deplorable resistance. The intent is to isolate and eliminate the heartland dissenters because they are the only threat that has the ability to win the infowar of ideas. Since the establishment is hell-bent on waging a civil war against the faithful, the remnant and torch guardians must commit to the purging of the fifth column subversives that occupy the government.As the establishment and mainstream media sharks continue to encircle the Trump agenda, their blood thirsty appetite quickens. Their Dracula heritage has drained the inherent vital courage from the masses that subsist in a pseudo reality imposed by a hostile New World Order.This perceptibility is categorically opposite to the fundamental precepts that were universally accepted when the country was founded. Independence Day deserves a proper reverence. Before the nation can earn that privilege, it must mature and own up and admit that the de facto foe of the populist is the very government that so many celebrate.[Let us not forget, it s meant to be a government by the people, and for the people]See more of SARTRE s original work at BATR.netDiscuss or comment about this essay on the BATR ForumREAD MORE TRUMP NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire TRUMP FilesSUPPORT OUR WORK BY SUBSCRIBING & BECOMING A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",Middle-east,"July 4, 2017"
10180,OKLAHOMA Supreme Court Rules Punishing Smokers With Cigarette Tax “Unconstitutional”…Lawmakers Forced To Fill SHOCKING Hole In State Budget,"OKLAHOMA CITY   The Oklahoma Supreme Court ruled the cigarette tax passed late in the legislative session unconstitutional Thursday morning.The tax was expected to bring in more than $200 million of revenue for the state budget by tacking on an extra $1.50 per pack of cigarettes. The budget was planned and passed assuming the tax would hold.The tax was originally passed after the deadline for revenue raising bills, but Republican lawmakers tried to eke it through as a fee. A tax would have required a three-fourths majority to pass. Justices on Thursday ruled that, because the funds raised could be used for non-smoking related programs, the bill could not go through as a regulatory fee.The State now has a week to seek a rehearing. If it does not, the ruling is final.Gov. Mary Fallin issued a response to the Supreme Court s ruling:I am disappointed to hear the Supreme Court struck down the smoking cessation fee, but I certainly respect the justices  authority. I will be discussing with legislative leaders from both parties the need to address the $215 million shortfall this will create for the Department of Human Services, the Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services and the Oklahoma Health Care Authority, the three agencies that received the bulk of the money that was to be generated by the cessation fee.These agencies and the people they serve cannot sustain the kind of cuts that will occur if we do not find a solution. My belief is we will have to come into special session to address this issue.House Minority Leader Scott Inman released the following statement on the ruling:Once again, Governor Fallin and Republican legislators have failed Oklahoma. My caucus and I sounded every alarm bell we could to stop this from happening, yet here we are, just as we warned.Today, I m urging Governor Fallin to call for a special session and for Republican leaders to come together with myself and Sen. Sparks and draft a truly bipartisan and constitutional budget plan that will help to restore, reinvest in, and rebuild Oklahoma.With our state agencies facing more budget cuts and with even more rulings waiting, the time is now to work out a budget agreement before a special session of the legislature. By coming together now and putting a plan in place, we can save precious time and taxpayer dollars to fix the mess that their failed leadership has put us in because of their failed policies to cut taxes for the wealthy and well-connected.This cigarette tax was just a Band-Aid put on their gaping wound of a budget hole. Schools are down to 4-day weeks, hospitals are closing down, and public safety is in a crisis, not because cigarettes are too cheap, but because Republican policies benefitting their donors have failed us.For entire story: News 9",politics,"Aug 10, 2017"

The Daily Caller just exclusively reported that Awan attempted to destroy hard drives then desperately tried to retrieve them when they were discovered.GETTING THOSE DESTROYED HARD RIVES BACK:Pakistani-born Imran Awan, long-time right-hand IT aide to the former Democratic National Committee (DNC) Chairwoman, has since desperately tried to get the hard drives back, the individual told The Daily Caller News Foundation s Investigative Group.A high-level congressional source, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the probe, confirmed that the FBI has joined what Politico previously described as a Capitol Police criminal probe into  serious, potentially illegal, violations on the House IT network  by Imran and three of his relatives, who had access to the emails and files of the more than two dozen House Democrats who employed them on a part-time basis.Capitol Police have also seized computer equipment tied to the Florida lawmaker.Awan s younger brothers, Abid and Jamal, his wife, Hina Alvi, and Rao Abbas, Imran s best friend, are also under investigation. There have been no arrests in the case.THIS CASE IS HUGE! MARIA BARTIROMO IS LIVID ABOUT IT:A Pakistani family under criminal investigation by the U.S. Capitol Police (see our previous report below) for abusing their access to the House of Representatives information technology (IT) system may have engaged in myriad other questionable schemes besides allegedly placing  ghost employees  on the congressional payroll.Imran Awan, his wife Hina, and brothers Abid and Jamal collectively netted more than $4 million in salary as IT administrators for House Democrats between 2009 and 2017. Yet the absence of signs of wealth displayed among them raise questions such as was the money sent overseas or did something other than paychecks motivate their actions?Capitol Police revoked the Awans  access to the congressional IT system in February 2017 after a major data breach was detected. Their access had allowed them to read emails and files of dozens of members, including many serving on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and the House Committee on Foreign Affairs.OUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON THIS   THE MAIN STREAM MEDIA IS IGNORING THE CRIMINALITY OF THESE BROTHERS:3 MUSLIM BROTHERS Working For Dems In Congress CAUGHT Accessing Unauthorized Top-Secret Government Intel One Has Criminal Background May Have Ties To Muslim Brotherhood [VIDEO]3 Congressional IT employees have been fired for accessing members computer networks without permission. Maria s on the show, knows more about this. Can you fill me in a bit.Here are their names Stuart. let me tell you what the 3 people that were fired on Thursday: Abid, Imran and Jamal Awan. They were barred from computer networks at the House of Representatives on Thursday because they accessed Congressmen and Congress people s computer networks unauthorized. At a minimum they were fired. At a minimum we know that they accessed computers unauthorized and they did so in foreign intelligence, foreign affairs and intelligence committees.  Okay? So they were getting very important information, government information. They accessed these computers. That is the least of it. There s also some talk that people are looking into what ties they have into terrorism. Are they impacted by the Muslim Brotherhood? Are they a part of the Muslim Brotherhood? One of them has a criminal background!How is it possible that 3 brothers are hired, Muslim brothers just saying, to work in Congress and deal with our most intelligent and sensitive information, number one? They were all making $160,000! Why were they paid so much? 22 years old one of the guys, the other was 25. They re making $160,000, $161,000 and $165,000. And one of them has a criminal background! I hear what you re saying, I mean, these intelligence committees handle our terror strategies right? They got in on Benghazi by the way.Yes, and they also worked for many Democrats in the House. They are thinking that they may be also one of the reasons Debbie Wasserman Schultz got hacked. There s so much more to come on this Stuart, it s an incredible story. I think it s amazing!Chiefs of staff for dozens of Democratic lawmakers who employed the four were informed last week that a criminal probe was underway into their use of congressional information technology systems, including the existence of an external server to which House data was being funneled, and into the theft of and overbilling for computer equipment.Their salaries and time were shared among dozens of Democratic members, including former Democratic National Committee Chairman Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida.Chiefs of staff for dozens of Democratic lawmakers who employed the four were informed last week that a criminal probe was underway into their use of congressional information technology systems, including the existence of an external server to which House data was being funneled, and into the theft of and overbilling for computer equipment.Despite the generous salaries, the four were involved in multiple suspicious mortgage transfers and a debt-evading bankruptcy. Abid had more than $1 million in debts following a failed business called Cars International that he ran in Falls Church, Va., from November 2009 to September 2010. Business associates said in court documents that Abid had stolen money and vehicles from them.It s unclear how Abid found time to run an automotive business while working full-time for Congress. He had been on the congressional payroll since 2005. A congressional credit union repossessed two of his personal cars before the business folded.Abid filed for bankruptcy in 2012, but somehow managed to keep ownership of two houses while telling the bankruptcy court and creditors that he had no assets with which to pay them. He signed a sworn statement that he and his wife, Natalia Soba, were living apart and needed separate residences. My spouse and I are legally separated under applicable non-bankruptcy law or my spouse and I are living apart other than for the purpose of evading the requirements of   707(b)(2)(A) of the Bankruptcy Code,  Abid claimed in bankruptcy documents. But both houses had been in the family for years.Abid s record includes numerous driving- and alcohol-related legal problems, including driving with a suspended or revoked license, court records show. He was found guilty of drunk driving a month before he started at the House, and was arrested for public intoxication a month after his first day.A spokesman for Rep. Joaquin Castro of Texas told TheDCNF Friday that Jamal s  employment with our office has been terminated. Hilarie Chambers, a spokeswoman for Rep. Sandy Levin   who employed Abid   told TheDCNF that  after being notified by the House Administration Committee, this individual was removed from our payroll. We are confident that everything in our office is secure. Not every Democrat is willing to terminate their connection with these four:Some Democrats have not terminated their connection with the four, including Wasserman Schultz, who employs Imran and who resigned from her DNC post last year after a computer hack revealed embarassing emails. Derrick Robinson, spokesman for California Rep. Karen Bass, refused to comment on Alvi s employment status.For entire story: Daily Caller",Government News,"Jul 28, 2017"
17052,SLICK SCAM: John Kerry Warns Global Warming Will Produce Millions Of “Climate Refugees”,"Sure, we need to save people from something that s naturally occurring pretty soon everyone with a hangnail will be considered a refugee. This is simply a scam to broaden further the definition of a refugee so that pretty much anyone can come to the West. I detest the global warming kook-aid drinkers like Kerry. He s already shoving 200,000 Muslim refugees down our throats as it is.Secretary of State John Kerry warns the world that more and more people will be fleeing the devastation caused by global warming.  It s something new. We have climate refugees today,  he said during a town hall event about the oceans.Kerry described climate refugees as people who had to leave their homes because of drought, rising sea levels, and thawing permafrost. The day could come, if we don t respond rapidly, you could have millions of climate refugees. You could have people moving from whole areas where today you can grow things and tomorrow you can t,  he said.He remarked that more world leaders had begun to talk about this rising threat in many of his international meetings, although he admitted that the issue was not yet a  crescendo. International organizations, like the United Nations, he admitted, would have to codify the term  climate refugee  and put it into law. That would grant special immigration privileges to immigrants claiming refugee status, allowing them to move to other countries. I think it s just a matter of time before it fits in under a category and countries have   and the refugee process has legitimately incorporated it into our policy,  Kerry said.Via: Breitbart",Government News,"Oct 9, 2015"

Maybe it s an old Howard Stern recording in which someone reminds him that he says he likes to go to Russia to have sex with women because they  have no morals. That s pretty interesting considering the current situation, but it s probably the recent bombshell report by a BBC correspondent that there are at least four sources for what Trump is calling fake news. According to Paul Wood in a recent op-ed:Claims about a Russian blackmail tape were made in one of a series of reports written by a former British intelligence agent. As a member of MI6, he had been posted to the UK s embassy in Moscow and now runs a consultancy giving advice on doing business in Russia. He spoke to a number of his old contacts in the FSB, the successor to the KGB, paying some of them for information. .The former MI6 agent is not the only source for the claim about Russian kompromat on the president-elect. Back in August, a retired spy told me he had been informed of its existence by  the head of an East European intelligence agency .Later, I used an intermediary to pass some questions to active duty CIA officers dealing with the case file  they would not speak to me directly. I got a message back that there was  more than one tape ,  audio and video , on  more than one date , in  more than one place  in the Ritz-Carlton in Moscow and also in St Petersburg  and that the material was  of a sexual nature . The claims of Russian kompromat on Mr Trump were  credible , the CIA believed. .Last April, the CIA director was shown intelligence that worried him. It was  allegedly  a tape recording of a conversation about money from the Kremlin going into the US presidential campaign.It was passed to the US by an intelligence agency of one of the Baltic States.The CIA cannot act domestically against American citizens so a joint counter-intelligence taskforce was created .A lawyer  outside the Department of Justice but familiar with the case  told me that three of Mr Trump s associates were the subject of the inquiry.  But it s clear this is about Trump,  he said.Audio. And. Video.Trump spent well over a half hour attacking Hillary Clinton and screaming about how the Kremlin is right. He did this a week before he officially becomes President. Is this what it s going to be like for the next four years?Featured image via Getty Images (Scott Olson)/screengrab",News,"January 13, 2017"
12780,DID HILLARY REALLY THINK She’d Get Away With Telling Big Fat Lie About Obama’s “Red Line” Comment?,"It s not a big surprise given her propensity for lying, but when Hillary knew she was getting destroyed by Trump on her ineffective, embarrassing record as Secretary of State, she lied about not being Obama s Secretary of State during his ridiculous  red line  comment During Sunday night s presidential debate, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton denied that she was in office as Secretary of State when President Barack Obama refused to punish Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad for using chemical weapons against civilians after calling chemical weapons use a  red line  which could not be crossed. They had a chance to do something with Syria, and that was the line,  Republican nominee Donald Trump said of his Democratic rival and the administration in which she worked.  You were there as Secretary of State with the so-called  line in the sand. No, I wasn t, I was gone,  Clinton replied.President Obama delivered his famous  red line  speech   in which he described the use of chemical weapons against civilians by Assad as a  red line  that Assad could not cross without suffering serious international consequences   in August 2012. We have been very clear to the Assad regime, but also to other players on the ground, that a red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized. That would change my calculus,  President Obama said at the time.Hillary Clinton served President Obama as Secretary of State from January 21, 2009 to February 1, 2013, according to the State Department. She was not in office when Assad used chemical weapons yet again in 2015, violating international law. The White House did not respond to Assad with any direct military retaliation.

1317, Comey Plans To Tell The World About Trump’s Illegal Requests In BOMBSHELL Testimony,"Former FBI Director James Comey is now one of the most dangerous men in Washington to Donald Trump. There is nothing that could harm Trump like Comey testifying under oath in an open session of Congress   yet that is exactly what Comey plans to do. Special Counsel Robert Mueller has reportedly cleared Comey to testify, and boy will that testimony be a doozy.Of course, we all remember the reports that Comey kept meticulous notes on his conversations with Trump, because the orange wannabe  president  unsettled him with his inappropriate requests. We also remember how one of those memos was leaked, and it alleged that Trump tried to obstruct justice. Now, new reports suggest that Comey plans to tell the world about every contentious conversation he ever had with Trump   including the parts where what Trump requested of Comey could indeed amount to obstruction of justice regarding the Russia probe   which is, of course, a felony.Because of the addition of Special Counsel Mueller to the investigation, there will likely be no testimony regarding what is going on inside the investigation himself. However, that matters not in this instance, as it appears that when Comey sits down before the Senate Intelligence Committee, he plans to sing like a canary; in fact, reports say he can t wait to do it. From CNN:But he appears eager to discuss his tense interactions with Trump before his firing, which have now spurred allegations that the president may have tried to obstruct the investigation. If it happens, Comey s public testimony promises to be a dramatic chapter in the months-long controversy, and it will likely bring even more intense scrutiny to an investigation that Trump has repeatedly denounced as a  witch hunt. Indeed, this should be very interesting. We won t have long to wait, either. While there is no date set in stone just yet, Comey s remarks may be up to be scheduled within the next week or two. All he has to do is to make sure that he knows the bounds he must stay within before moving forward.Pop the popcorn for this one, folks. It will definitely be interesting.Featured image via Andrew Harrer-Pool/Getty Images",News,"May 31, 2017"
156, Russians Fooled Dumbass Conservatives With Meme Of Hillary Fistfighting Jesus,"If Hillary Clinton got into a fistfight with Jesus, who would you want to win? Before you laugh, consider that some among us are actually stupid enough to respond positively to this sort of question   assuming  positively  means  like a bunch of douchebags. When you saw the popular meme floating around prior to the election, you probably assumed it was an over-the-top joke post. But this is the type of this that Russian bots and trolls were actually marketing to our beloved dolts on the Right.Since conservatives respond to anything with  Jesus  in the name the meme, which was part of a paid advertising campaign from the Russia-created Christian group  Army of Jesus,  was pretty successful with the Stupid Part of America.I don't know why I am so fascinated by this fake ad that @MarkWarner shared showing Hillary boxing Jesus. pic.twitter.com/BkR8XRUOYj  Marcus Gilmer (@marcusgilmer) November 1, 2017The paid Russian ad, revealed by Democratic Senator Mark Warner, was among several that were showcased during Wednesday s congressional hearing with social media leaders regarding Russian interference in the 2016 election.Russian operatives also pushed the idea that Texas should secede from the United States, a fake movement that became popular with very real conservatives as the election season rolled on, organized both pro- and anti-Muslim events at the same time and place, and convinced conservatives that control of the Army should be taken away from the President if that President happens to have a vagina:NEW: These are the first two Russian-bought Facebook ads to be released by Congress. pic.twitter.com/1ThgzYNdTf  Donie O'Sullivan (@donie) October 31, 2017Russia ran more than 3,000 political ads on Facebook and Twitter, spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to trick the American people.Much of the advertising was concentrated in key swing states, and at one point Twitter users were bombarded with more fake news than real news.This is just one of the many attacks on our election from Donald Trump s friends in Russia.

582, Trump Is Now Talking About Going To War With Three Countries,"Before dawn on Wednesday, the feds raided the home of former Donald Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort. Trump, as intelligence expert Malcolm Nance says, is getting buggy. The investigation is getting closer and closer to him, and his poll numbers are in a free-fall, so from the safety of 17 day golf vacation in New Jersey, Trump is threatening war against not one, not two, but three countries.Most of the media has been covering his exchange of provocative nuclear threats with North Korean Dictator Kim Jong Un. If that s not terrifying enough, Trump also hinted that he s planning to attack Iran because, well, they may or may not be abiding by the nuclear deal. All indications are that they are, but that doesn t stop a commander-in-chief who desperately, so desperately, needs a way to wag the dog.On Friday, Trump announced that there might be a third war on the table. This one against Venezuela. We have many options for Venezuela, including a possible military option, if necessary,  Trump told reporters at his New Jersey golf club on Friday.The president did not answer a question about whether American troops would lead a potential operation. We don t talk about it. But a military operation, a military option, is certainly something we could pursue,  he responded.Source: CNBCTo be fair, Venezuela isn t exactly our friend. Two years ago, President Obama issued sanctions against the oil-rich country, in part over its human rights abuses.The White House said the order targeted people whose actions undermined democratic processes or institutions, had committed acts of violence or abuse of human rights, were involved in prohibiting or penalizing freedom of expression, or were government officials involved in public corruption. Venezuelan officials past and present who violate the human rights of Venezuelan citizens and engage in acts of public corruption will not be welcome here, and we now have the tools to block their assets and their use of U.S. financial systems,  White House spokesman Josh Earnest said in a statement. We are deeply concerned by the Venezuelan government s efforts to escalate intimidation of its political opponents,  he added.Source: ReutersTrump, whose only political tactic is to try to intimidate his political opponents, also complained about the human rights abuses, despite having no problems with the human rights abuses of Saudi Arabia, Russia and the Philippines.One fact, and only one fact, might indicate that Trump is just bluster. Trump s cozy relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin might actually be keeping us safer, at least as far as the idea of Trump waging war against Venezuela or North Korea. Venezuela is a strong trading partner of Russia. Putin also backs North Korea, as does our largest trading partner, China.This whole show could be just Trump trying to boost his poll numbers, or it could be his way of pretending to create distance between him and Putin, but regardless, the talk is reckless and potentially deadly. The people he s threatening don t see his talk as political posturing. They are taking it very seriously and even if Trump doesn t pull the trigger first, they certainly could.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"August 11, 2017"

5768, Hillary Clinton CRUSHES Donald Trump In This ‘Solid’ Red State,"As polls show Clinton beating Donald Trump in Kansas and catching up in Georgia, another  solid red state  is showing the presumptive Democratic nominee beating the Republican nominee.A recent poll conducted by OH Predictive Insight shows Hillary Clinton beating Donald Trump in Arizona by 5 points, 47-42 (with approximately 6 percent backing a third party candidate and less than approximately 6 percent unsure).The poll surveyed a whopping 1,060 likely Democratic, Republican, Independent and Non-Declared voters across the Grand Canyon state, and found that Trump s trailing comes from his serious deficit with women and urban voters. The last time a Democrat carried Arizona was in 1996, when Bill Clinton was elected to his second term.The pollsters responded with shock at Arizona s competitiveness. Mike Noble, managing partner of the polling company, said of the findings: It s very surprising to think that Hillary Clinton may carry Arizona, a state that holds the narratives of SB1070, two nationally known anti-illegal immigration sheriffs, liberal gun laws and consistently conservative constituents. Wes Gullet, another partner in the company and a former Phoenix mayoral candidate, echoed Noble s shock at the results: It s shocking to think that a Democratic presidential candidate would carry Arizona if the election were held today, considering that every statewide office in Arizona is held by a Republican as well as significant majorities in the Arizona House and Senate.  Arizona should be a reliable red state. The poll also showed 10 percent of Democrats backing Trump while 13 percent of Republicans are backing Clinton. Clinton also led Trump among Independents 45-38, a seven point advantage.In 2012, Mitt Romney won Arizona by 9 percent. The fact that Clinton nabs Independent voters and more Republicans than Trump does with Democrats could turn Arizona blue.The state that has given us SB 1070, Jan Brewer, Sheriff Joe Arpaio and a cranky John McCain may be turning blue after all. Maybe putting a racist, sexist xenophobe as the Republican Party s nominee wasn t such a good idea.Featured image via Sara D. Davis/Getty Images",News,"June 22, 2016"
10391,OOPS! MIT Researchers Debunk Global Warming Data…Report Confirms President Trump Was Right To Pull Out Of Paris Climate Agreement,"B b..but Al Gore and Barack Obama say Scientists  were exposed for manipulating climate data during the 2011 Climategate  scandal when 5,000 emails were released from scientists proving that the science behind their studies is inconclusive and mostly a result of manipulating climate data to fit the political message they were trying to convey.Three themes emerged from the emails that were released in the Climategate scandal: (1) prominent scientists central to the global warming debate are taking measures to conceal rather than disseminate underlying data and discussions; (2) these scientists view global warming as a political  cause  rather than a balanced scientific inquiry and (3) many of these scientists frankly admit to each other that much of the science is weak and dependent on deliberate manipulation of facts and data.  ForbesA new report on global warming data has now proven President Donald Trump to be right to pull out of the Paris Agreement. The report analyzed climate data such as Global Average Surface Temperature (GAST), the NOAA, and HADLEY.SHFTPLan reports: According to the report, which has been peer reviewed by administrators, scientists and researchers from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (M.I.T.), and several of America s leading universities, the data is completely bunk: In this research report, the most important surface data adjustment issues are identified and past changes in the previously reported historical data are quantified. It was found that each new version of GAST has nearly always exhibited a steeper warming linear trend over its entire history. And, it was nearly always accomplished by systematically removing the previously existing cyclical temperature pattern. This was true for all three entities providing GAST data measurement, NOAA, NASA and Hadley CRU.As a result, this research sought to validate the current estimates of GAST using the best available relevant data. This included the best documented and understood data sets from the U.S. and elsewhere as well as global data from satellites that provide far more extensive global coverage and are not contaminated by bad siting and urbanization impacts. Satellite data integrity also benefits from having cross checks with Balloon data.The conclusive findings of this research are that the three GAST data sets are not a valid representation of reality. In fact, the magnitude of their historical data adjustments, that removed their cyclical temperature patterns, are totally inconsistent with published and credible U.S. and other temperature data. Thus, it is impossible to conclude from the three published GAST data sets that recent years have been the warmest ever  despite current claims of record setting warming.Finally, since GAST data set validity is a necessary condition for EPA s GHG/CO2 Endangerment Finding, it too is invalidated by these research findings. (Full Abstract Report) Fox News reported on President Trump pulling out of the Paris Agreement per his campaign promise: he is leading. President Trump is withdrawing the United States from the Paris Climate Accord.It is the right decision for a number of reasons.First, the Paris Accord is being treated by many as a treaty with treaty obligations, but President Obama never submitted it to Congress for passage.Second, though President Trump could have left it in place and done nothing, his successor could have easily revived it if left in place.Third, the structure and implementation of the Paris Accord set a terrible precedent. President Obama worked for what amounts to a global agreement with voluntary measures, but those measures would impact the American economy. But, despite that impact, President Obama did not present the Paris Accord to Congress for ratification or debate. Members of the liberal establishment were outraged.Obama criticized President Trump s decision to pull out of the Paris Climate agreement with the following statement : A year and a half ago, the world came together in Paris around the first-ever global agreement to set the world on a low-carbon course and protect the world we leave to our children.It was steady, principled American leadership on the world stage that made that achievement possible.  It was bold American ambition that encouraged dozens of other nations to set their sights higher as well. And what made that leadership and ambition possible was America s private innovation and public investment in growing industries like wind and solar   industries that created some of the fastest new streams of good-paying jobs in recent years, and contributed to the longest streak of job creation in our history.Simply put, the private sector already chose a low-carbon future.  And for the nations that committed themselves to that future, the Paris Agreement opened the floodgates for businesses, scientists, and engineers to unleash high-tech, low-carbon investment and innovation on an unprecedented scale.The nations that remain in the Paris Agreement will be the nations that reap the benefits in jobs and industries created.  I believe the United States of America should be at the front of the pack.  But even in the absence of American leadership; even as this Administration joins a small handful of nations that reject the future; I m confident that our states, cities, and businesses will step up and do even more to lead the way, and help protect for future generations the one planet we ve got. But of course, like all Champagne Socialists, their credo is  do as I say, not as I do,  with Obama jacking up his carbon footprint when abroad. Who could forget Obama s massive convoy during a recent speaking gig in Milan?The Independent Journal Review reported: Former President Barack Obama traveled to Italy this week to make a speech on climate change at the  Seed & Chips: The Global Food Innovation Summit  in the city of Milan.It seems like Obama has taken a page out of Leonardo DiCaprio s book of  do as I say, not as I do  and took a private jet to Milan. Not only that, he had a 14 car convoy to get into the city, which also included protection from above with a helicopter.It doesn t end there. According to The Daily Mail, 300 police officers were used to protect the former president.The fleet of 14 included multiple SUVs, police cars, and sedans   not to mention a few motorcycles. Here s another look at the convoy:While in Milan, Obama also met with former Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, who was a close partner during their respective times in office.

7321," ‘Go F*ck Yourselves’: Larry Wilmore SLAMS Ted Cruz, Fox News Over Anti-Muslim Rhetoric (VIDEO)","The terror attacks in Brussels, Belgium have brought out the Muslim-haters on the right in full force   particularly GOP presidential hopeful Ted Cruz. The creepiest candidate on the right has openly called for the police to increase patrols in  Muslim neighborhoods,  and has gotten backing for his disgusting statements from the network that is a longtime mouthpiece of the bigoted right   Fox News.Well, there s one person who isn t taking their bullshit lying down: Comedy Central host Larry Wilmore. On Wednesday night s edition of his show, Wilmore blasted Cruz and Fox over their bigotry, and especially their insistence that anyone questioning their hateful words is just being  politically correct. Gooooooooo f*ck yourselves.   I mean, a major news network, so-called major news network, and a major presidential candidate slamming a major religion has nothing to do with political correctness. It s just wrong. To round out the hilarious   but truthful   segment, Wilmore interviewed Masir Ali, an expert on the Middle East. He weighed in from a snowy vacation, complete with snowboard, to show everyone just how dumb Ted Cruz and Fox News really are.The Nightly Show host is right. They are wrong. Bigotry and discrimination are a huge and major selling point with right-wingers, and here in the year 2016 that is just shameful. We seriously have one of the two major political parties in America that gets most of their votes for hating on anyone who isn t straight, white, male, and Christian.

5910, The Gay Men Killed In Fl. Shooting Would Not Have Been Able To Donate Blood Today,"Blood donations are urgently needed in the Orlando, Florida area following Saturday night s massacre. So far, 50 people have died in the massacre and at least 53 are hospitalized due to injuries. The shooting took place at Pulse, an LGBT nightclub.The current crisis reveals the incredibly homophobic rules put in place by the FDA regarding blood donations. The FDA s current rules stipulate that any man who has had sex with another man cannot donate blood until they have been celibate for one year. This bars nearly all gay and bisexual men from being able to donate blood.According to reports, One Blood, a blood donation center in Orlando, has temporarily lifted the ban on blood for their organization, allowing men who have had homosexual intercourse donate to their organization. One Blood reports that their blood donation center is currently at capacity. However, they will still need high numbers of donations over the next few days in order to keep replenishing their stock. A tremendous response by blood donors in light of the tragic mass shooting in Orlando. We are asking donors to donate over the next several days to help replenish the blood supply. We are asking people please make an appointment online or call 1.888.9.DONATE (1.888.936.6283). Thank you! As our nation collectively mourns the massive loss of life in Florida, it is a good time for us to look at the institutionalized homophobia that helps to create a culture that determines that LGBT lives and bodies are lesser than that of heteronormative individuals. Right now, the blood of gay and bisexual men, as well as so many others, stains the interior of the Pulse nightclub. Orlando s Mayor Buddy Dyer, described the scene by saying: There s blood everywhere. As far as the FDA is concerned, the blood of those who died on Saturday had no value to living.Blood is thoroughly screened by blood donation organizations no matter who donates to them. There is no need for this discriminatory policy. Nothing should prevent a healthy person from being able to give the gift of saving a life. The horror that occurred on Saturday night proved that gay, bisexual, straight, man, women, black, or white we all bleed and that all life is precious.Featured image from Photo by Tim Matsui/Getty Images",News,"June 12, 2016"

3324, Fox News Host Bill O’Reilly Literally Just Endorsed White Supremacy (VIDEO),"On Tuesday night, Fox News blowhard and right-wing messiah Bill O Reilly made it very clear that Republicans  primary focus comes down to one thing: the white-dominated power structure, and those dastardly liberals, he says, are out to destroy it.O Reilly says that liberals want to get rid of the Electoral College   which has twice in recent memory allowed someone completely unqualified to assume office despite losing the popular vote   because they want power taken away from the white establishment. The left in America is demanding that the Electoral College system put into place in 1787 be scrapped. But there is a hidden reason for this,  O Reilly said, adding that voting patterns reveal that most minority votes go to the Democratic Party. This is unsurprising to anyone who pays attention to the way Republicans talk about Muslims, Hispanics, women, African-Americans, and pretty much anyone whose skin tone is darker than a piece of classroom chalk. But to O Reilly, it s a conspiracy against white people   a conspiracy to silence white rural voters by counting each and every person s vote equally, no matter where they live: Very few commentators will tell you that the heart of liberalism in America today is based on race. It permeates almost every issue. That white men have set up a system of oppression. That system must be destroyed. O Reilly may scorn the idea, but white men really have set up a system of oppression. Time magazine notes that the Electoral College largely exists to benefit white slave owners in the south:At the Philadelphia convention, the visionary Pennsylvanian James Wilson proposed direct national election of the president. But the savvy Virginian James Madison responded that such a system would prove unacceptable to the South:  The right of suffrage was much more diffusive [i.e., extensive] in the Northern than the Southern States; and the latter could have no influence in the election on the score of Negroes.  In other words, in a direct election system, the North would outnumber the South, whose many slaves (more than half a million in all) of course could not vote. But the Electoral College a prototype of which Madison proposed in this same speech instead let each southern state count its slaves, albeit with a two-fifths discount, in computing its share of the overall count.[ ]Virginia emerged as the big winner the California of the Founding era with 12 out of a total of 91 electoral votes allocated by the Philadelphia Constitution, more than a quarter of the 46 needed to win an election in the first round. After the 1800 census, Wilson s free state of Pennsylvania had 10% more free persons than Virginia, but got 20% fewer electoral votes. Perversely, the more slaves Virginia (or any other slave state) bought or bred, the more electoral votes it would receive. Were a slave state to free any blacks who then moved North, the state could actually lose electoral votes.If the system s pro-slavery tilt was not overwhelmingly obvious when the Constitution was ratified, it quickly became so. For 32 of the Constitution s first 36 years, a white slaveholding Virginian occupied the presidency. White men have largely abandoned the Democrats, and the left believes it s because of racism that they want to punish minorities, keep them down, O Reilly told his mindless audience, apparently forgetting that conservatives regularly list the ways they want to punish minorities and keep them down (voter I.D. laws, for example). Summing up: Left wants power taken away from the white establishment. They want a profound change in the way America is run. Taking voting power away from the white precincts is the quickest way to do that. This isn t the first time O Reilly has made similar complaints. In 2007, he and John McCain joined together to prattle on about how liberals want to break down the  white Christian male power structure  that has been long-established in our country. In 2012, he complained to Megyn Kelly that the  white establishment is now the minority. O Reilly s latest rant was so stupid that the typically nonsensical and terrible  SooperMexican  over at RightScoop put him on blast:Is that really what conservatism is conserving? White establishment power? Here I thought it was about free markets, free people, and getting the government out of our way. Well, I feel stupid. I wish the GOP had mentioned this earlier.Well darn. As you probably know, I m a minority conservative, and I really hate and despise how the left makes all politics about racial identity, as I wrote here. But the age of Trump makes it sound like  conservatism  is being redefined as pro-white identity politics. This can t be a coincidence, right?Watch O Reilly s latest racist rant below:Featured image via screengrab",News,"December 21, 2016"
20599,BREAKING: FLINT’S DEMOCRAT MAYOR SUED After Whistleblower Rats Her Out For STEALING DONATIONS Meant For Residents,"Democrats looking for attention and along with every celebrity who has been able to find their way to the burned out city of Flint, MI have all jumped on the  It s all Michigan s Republican Governor Snyder s fault  bandwagon. In reality, there has been plenty of blame to go around. Obama s EPA Director, Gina McCarthy has plenty of culpability when it comes to the involvement of her EPA officials and the cover up of the Flint water crisis. In the end however, it s never about the people of Flint, it s about saving the hides of the inept political officials who allowed this crisis to happen. Flint Lives really don t Matter to greedy politicians like Hillary Clinton, who have used the horrible misfortune of Flint residents to gain trust and votes in the black community.Will anyone remember Hillary s support for black Democrat Mayor Karen Weaver, who is now being accused of STEALING money from charitable donations (that should have been used to support the people who are suffering in the community where she was elected) and putting it into her own campaign fund?The Flint water crisis has triggered yet another lawsuit, this one filed by the city s former administrator, who claims she was wrongfully fired for blowing the whistle on the mayor of Flint for allegedly trying to steer money from a charity for local families into a campaign fund.Former City Administrator Natasha Henderson, 39, who now lives in Muskegon, claims in a lawsuit filed today in U.S. District Court that she was terminated on Feb. 12 for seeking an investigation into allegations of misconduct by Flint Mayor Karen Weaver.Specifically, the suit alleges that Weaver directed a city employee and volunteer to steer donors away from a charity called Safe Water/Safe Homes, and instead give money to the so-called  Karenabout Flint  fund, which was a political action committee or campaign fund created at Weaver s direction.According to the lawsuit, a city employee told Henderson in confidence that she and a volunteer had previously been directing donors to the City of Flint s website, where they could give money to the Safe Water/Safe Homes charity, which helped families affected by the water crisis. But Weaver directed them to steer donors to the  Karenabout Flint  website, which the city council had not approved, the suit claims. A red flag went off when it was an unrecognizable fund,  Henderson s lawyer, Katherine Smith Kennedy, told the Free Press.  She did the right thing. She reported the matter to the city attorney. And for doing the right thing, she was punished. She was fired. The lawsuit names the City of Flint and Weaver as defendants.For entire story: Detroit Free Press",left-news,"May 10, 2016"
1999," Republicans Turn On Trump, Throw Him Under The Bus For F*cking Up Health Care Plan (DETAILS)","When Republicans celebrated Donald Trump s undeserved election victory, they probably never imagined he d damage the party as badly as he already has in just nine weeks.This week, Trump once again embarrassed the GOP by messing up their first attempt to repeal and replace Obamacare. Not only did Trump fail to sell the disastrous American Health Care Act, but he pulled the bill on Friday. Understandably, Republicans are pissed that Trump conducted things this way, and are distancing themselves from him more than ever. In fact, they re blaming him and saying that he and the White House had been an obstacle from the start, setting them up for failure. One House Republican (who wanted to remain anonymous) said: Their heart was not in the healthcare battle. Think about the level of intensity on the executive orders for the travel ban, or on the wiretapping claims. He certainly checked the boxes on healthcare, to his credit. But it s self-evident there was not a certain level of intensity devoted to this. Trump and his minions have countered this claim, with Press Secretary Sean Spicer issuing a statement on Saturday: The president and vice president left everything on the field  They were making calls and having members to the White House all week. In total, we spoke or met with over 120 members of Congress. And yet, this doesn t seem to add up, considering that Trump s daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner were nowhere to be found as sh*t was hitting the fan on Friday. Kushner, who is one of Trump s key advisors, was actually skiing with Ivanka in Aspen as House Republicans tried to pass their horrible health care bill and failed. And it s not just Kushner they re pissed at   it s Trump himself.According to House staffers and other GOPers, Trump didn t seem focused when in meetings concerning the Obamacare repeal. Another unnamed Republican said: Halfway through that meeting, he stopped to talk about Gorsuch. His mind was bouncing around. I never felt they were dialed into this. Maybe next time the GOP will think twice about letting a five-year-old become their party s nominee. What we re witnessing here is the breakdown of the Republican Party, and it s so humiliating that we almost feel bad for them. Almost.Featured image is a screenshot",News,"March 25, 2017"

Donald Trump Gets His A** Handed To Him By A 10-Year-Old Girl (VIDEO)
","A 10-year-old girl smacked down Donald Trump, and it was amazing.On Saturday, the Huffington Post interviewed Lexi, an adorable Hillary Clinton volunteer who had absolutely no problem shredding the Republican billionaire when asked how she feels about him.Lexi slammed Trump for having zero experience in government and compared him to her brother who thinks he knows everything. Number one, he doesn t have any experience, at all,  Lexi said.  And he sits there and thinks,  Oh I m Mr. Donald Trump, I know everything,  which is sort of like my brother. She also broke the bad news to Trump s supporters that if they think they ll get money by voting for Trump, they are sorely mistaken. He s just rich, a lot of people just vote for him because they think they ll get some money, too. But that s not it. You think you re going to get the money, but that s not the case. Lexi then took aim at Trump s xenophobia and racism and made it clear what parents who vote for Trump can expect of their children s future should he get in the White House. Oh, and she also had positive things to say about Bernie Sanders, who she sees as someone who is  building an environment for the kids. It s ridiculous because I mean, look at these people, your best friend you may not know is Muslim or Jewish. And Bernie Sanders, he s Jewish. You don t see anybody talking about that. He s just building an environment for the kids, their parents are voting for Donald Trump, but little do they know that their kids will grow up not having a good education and not having good jobs. Lexi then warned that if people fail to show up and vote on Election Day in November, it could mean a Trump victory. And she thinks his hair is  gross. If you don t vote, then Mr. Donald Trump will be president. I don t think that s his real hair, being president. His hair, look at it! Look at it! It s gross. I can t believe that s his real hair.

In order to  ensure your holiday party is not a Christmas party in disguise,  the Office of Diversity and Inclusion has come up with a list of ways for supervisors to encourage individuals to celebrate their own religions and cultures without allegedly excluding anyone or even being seen as  endorsing religion :Holiday parties and celebrations should celebrate and build upon workplace relationships and team morale with no emphasis on religion or culture. Ensure your holiday party is not a Christmas party in disguise.Consider having a New Year s party and include d cor and food from multiple religions and cultures. Use it as an opportunity to reinvigorate individuals for the New Year s goals and priorities. Supervisors and managers should not as well as, not be perceived as endorsing religion generally or a specific religion.If an individual chooses not to participate in a holiday party or celebration, do not pressure the person to participate. Participation should be voluntary.If a potluck-style party or celebration is planned, encourage employees to bring food items that reflect their personal religions, cultures, and celebrations. Use this as an opportunity for individuals to share what they brought and why it is meaningful to them.If sending holiday cards to campus and community partners, send a non-denominational card or token of your gratitude.Holiday parties and celebrations should not play games with religious and cultural themes. For example,  Dreidel  or  Secret Santa.  If you want to exchange gifts, then refer to it in a general way, such as a practical joke gift exchange or secret gift exchange.D cor selection should be general, not specific to any religion or culture. Identify specific dates when d cor can be put up and when it must come down.Refreshment selection should be general, not specific to any religion or culture.Most importantly, celebrate your religious and cultural holidays in ways that are respectful and inclusive of our students, your colleagues, and our university.

4676, Facebook’s Bad Week Of ‘Trending News’ Ends With The Most Tone-Deaf 9/11 Topic Imaginable,"Today s a somber day of remembrance for the lives lost 15 years ago in the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, United Flight 93, and all the sacrifices made since then. Social media has been tracking 9/11 topics for the last several days, as they should, but two days ago, Facebook also decided to feature a story that s nothing but a truther conspiracy in its  trending topics  sidebar.9/11 truthers are conspiracy theorists loudly proclaiming that the attacks were an inside job. This particular story was from a U.K. tabloid site called The Daily Star, and it says (because of course it does): Engineers Steven Jones, Robert Korol, Anthony Szamboti and Ted Walter are part of the growing community of experts who say evidence indicates the towers were brought down in a controlled demolition.They wrote a paper for Europhysics News highlighting four important pieces of evidence pointing to this conclusion.These were: fires are not normally hot enough to heat a massive steel structure enough for it to collapse; the majority of high rise buildings have sprinkler systems that prevent a fire from getting hot enough to heat steel to a critical level; skyskrapers (sic) are protected using flame-proof materials and they are also designed so that if compromised, they do not collapse. Spelling errors aside, there is actually a wealth of evidence showing that the Twin Towers did not have adequate fireproofing on their superstructures. Not to mention that these four engineers are well-known truthers immune to actual science and fact. They re  experts,  though, and must be taken seriously. Not.But that s beside the point.Facebook recently got rid of all its trained journalists for its  trending  section. Zuckerberg said that the change was because they re a platform, not a content creator (the truth probably has more to do with money than that, but Facebook won t admit it). Yet, the result has been awful. A false story about Megyn Kelly. A man using a McChicken sandwich for sexual pleasure. A satire piece about Siri coming out of the iPhone 8 and cooking. BreitAnd now, an impossibly disrespectful story about the alleged truth of the 9/11 attacks. That trivializes everyone who died, everyone who worked rescue, everyone who s sick from working rescue, everyone who lost family members, our military men and women who died in Afghanistan trying to find Osama bin Laden and take down the Taliban, and the experiences of the entire country during and following that tragic day.While it s true that trending topics will include topics and stories we disagree with, for this to be one of the top trending stories just prior to the 15th anniversary of those attacks shows just how clueless, cold and insensitive Facebook has become without its real, bona fide journalists to determine trending topics.It seems that Facebook s decision to automate, automate, automate was one of the worst ideas in the long, sad history of bad ideas. Fortunately, this story was removed from their trending topics list, but the Internet never forgets.Featured image by Otto Greule Jr/Getty Images",News,"September 11, 2016"
11437,LOVE AT FIRST LEAK! Former “Baywatch” Star Pamela Anderson Becomes Regular Visitor Of Wikileaks Founder Julian Assange: “I think he’s quite sexy”,"Julian Assange became a computer hacker in his teen years. Assange got married when he was 18 and has a son. He and his wife separated and in 1999, after a protracted court battle, he reached a custody agreement with his wife.Assange gained worldwide fame and became a household name after he released hacked DNC emails shining a light on the ugly and questionable inner workings of Hillary, her campaign and many in the Democratic Party.Assange, who has been living in the embassy for four years after he was granted political asylum by Ecuador, came under fire this week after a 8,000-plus-file dump of CIA secrets was posted on WikiLeaks.Vice President Pence Thursday vowed to go after the web site, saying the leak was  one of the most significant compromises of national security in recent memory. Apparently Baywatch  star Pamela Anderson has a  thing  for  the world s most famous leaker, Julian Assange. Anderson s gone from slow motion runs on the beach to mysterious late night visits to the embassy where WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is holed up.Anderson was most recently spotted entering the Ecuadorian safe space in London Thursday night wearing a camel overcoat, snug black top   and either a really short skirt, or no pants at all.Anderson, 49, is a regular at the facility, coyly smiling for photographers as she struts inside to see Assange, 45, whose rogue outfit has dumped some of the US government s most closely guarded secrets.She refused to deny the dating rumors   saying he intellectually stimulates her more than all her  ex-husbands and lovers combined. I think he s quite sexy,  she wrote in a blog post on Thursday.  He has tremendous strength and stamina   though vulnerable. Hard to imagine him that way   as capable as he is. But, he is up against the biggest super powers in the world. Speaking to John Bishop on The Nightly Show this week, she described meeting Assange last year through British fashion designer Vivienne Westwood. We started seeing each other every month, and now we see each other a lot more regularly,  she said, according to The Sun. I do really think he s one of the most important people in the world, and I think what he does is historic. It s very important,  Anderson added.  He s very brave and he sacrificed a lot for all of us. NYP",politics,"Mar 11, 2017"

Trump is polling at an astounding 0% favorability rating with African-Americans with a whopping 97% unfavorability rating (though the 3% undecided, of course, might allow him to pull himself up to a whole 3%).New PPP poll released on @maddow right now  TRUMP FAV/UNFAV with African American voters is:Fav: 0%UnFav: 97%Undecided 3%  Jesse Ferguson (@JesseFFerguson) August 30, 2016The poll, which was conducted August 26-28 and has a margin of error of +/- 3%, also asked African-Americans to compare Trump to a number of things generally detested by society. He lost to personal injury lawyers, middle seats on airplanes, carnies, Ryan Lochte, junk mail, mosquitoes, the Bubonic Plague, and even bedbugs.The good news for Donald Trump in this PPP exclusive? Lots of opportunity for growth!#Maddow#BrightSides pic.twitter.com/6g5pny5usq  Maddow Blog (@MaddowBlog) August 30, 2016Overall, the poll shows Clinton leading Trump 42-37%, with Gary Johnson snagging 6% and Jill  Moon Beam  Stein somehow earning 4% of the vote and 10% undecided.Trump isn t exactly known for his love of African-Americans. Not only have his inflammatory remarks cemented him as the  KKK candidate,  but he actively practiced housing discrimination against black people, reportedly ordered all black people off the floor when visiting his businesses, argued in 1987 that five innocent black teens accused of rape should be executed (in fact, he took out a full-page newspaper ad to make this case), complained about  black guys counting [his] money,  has repeatedly questioned President Obama s citizenship, and much, much more.More recently, he has portrayed African-Americans as individuals with  no education  who are jobless with  no homes  who live in  war zones. His recent  outreach  efforts have been dismal as well, with The Donald seizing upon a NBA star s family member s death to say that the murder will cause Black people to vote for him:Dwyane Wade's cousin was just shot and killed walking her baby in Chicago. Just what I have been saying. African-Americans will VOTE TRUMP!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 27, 2016While Trump doesn t much talk to black people enough to know how much they hate him, The Star spoke to some African-Americans in Philadelphia, and they aren t exactly fans: Extremely insulting. And I think purposely insulting,  said lawyer Rasheedah Phillips, 32. He s getting the ships ready. He wants to send us back over to Africa,  said Douglas Skipworth, 33, who does maintenance work. Black folk aren t fooled by this thing. African-Americans are clear about who Trump is,  said professor Anyabwile Love, 41, watching his 2-year-old son.  Many other elections, local and national, it s been the lesser of the two evils. In this, it s not even lesser of two evils. It s one is completely against us and one is not. Trump has a historically dreadful approval rating with black voters, as low as 1 per cent. But as he frantically attempts to convince white people that he is not a racist, black people have suddenly become central to his message.Which black people believe is racist.[ ] I haven t been shot. I got an education,  said Donte, a 17-year-old high school student.  Or   Ihave an education. Just in case he hears this. The contempt was strong. Navy veteran Rodney Thomas, 50, said he stopped paying attention to Trump long ago, his mind made up, for this reason:  I hate stupidity.

14434,"GA SUPREME COURT Denies KKK Right To “Adopt A Highway”…While IL City “Unanimously, Proudly” Names Street After Black Panther","Is our government telling us certain hate groups are more acceptable than others?Does the Ku Klux Klan have a constitutional right to  adopt a highway ?That question was at the center of a high-profile battle Monday before the Georgia Supreme Court, where the Klan is challenging the state s refusal to let it participate in the popular Adopt-A-Highway program.The hate group, with the American Civil Liberties Union by its side, is casting its bid as a free speech issue. The government cannot be a censor of free speech,  Alan Berger, an attorney for the International Keystone Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, said.But the Georgia Department of Transportation has resisted the KKK s efforts ever since 2012 to join the program.For its part, GDOT maintains it should be allowed to exclude certain groups from the program   and stands by its claim that the KKK s  long rooted history of civil disturbance  would  cause a significant public concern. Monday s arguments centered around Georgia s claim of so-called sovereign immunity   a legal doctrine that shields the state from civil suit or criminal prosecution. The state had appealed a lower court decision by Judge Shawn LaGrua, who ruled Georgia was not protected against the KKK suit because the group claimed the discrimination involved a violation of its constitutional rights. The state denied the application, not because of safety hazard or some other compelling government interest, but because the state disagrees with what the KKK represents,  Maya Dillard Smith, executive director of the ACLU of Georgia, told FoxNews.com.  It is precisely this kind of government action the Constitution prohibits. While Smith admits that many people who hear about the case have a  visceral reaction  to it, she warns its outcome could have a dangerous ripple effect. What may seem as chipping away only at the KKK s free speech right, will, in fact, open Pandora s box and create legal precedent that justifies curtailing the free speech rights of religious evangelicals, abortion protestors and even Black Lives Matter supporters and opponents,  she said.A judgment is not expected for a couple of months, Berger told FoxNews.com following Monday s oral arguments. In the meantime, GDOT has suspended Adopt-a-Highway applications.This isn t the first time a state has gone rounds with the white supremacist group.In 1994, Missouri tried to block the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan from participating in its Adopt-A-Highway program.The group   which excludes anyone who is black, Jewish, Mexican or Asian   had requested a half-mile section of road on Interstate 55, one of the routes that had been used to bus black students to school as part of desegregation efforts near St. Louis.The state denied the KKK s request.In that case, lawyers for the state unsuccessfully argued that it had a right to control its own speech and that allowing the Klan to participate would violate the 1964 Civil Rights Act s ban on racial discrimination in federally funded programs.The U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear the case, thereby forcing the state to allow the group to take part in its  Adopt-A-Highway  program. However, the state later kicked the group out, saying it failed to do its job and pick up the litter on its adopted stretch of highway.

September 9, 2007From now on, Oak Street in Maywood will be known as Fred Hampton Way.Relatives of the slain Black Panther leader joined congressmen, activists and Maywood residents Saturday to dedicate the street and a statue of Hampton that now sits in front of the Fred Hampton Family Aquatic Center.Last year, efforts to name a street on Chicago s West Side for Hampton failed amid controversy that Hampton and the Panthers advocated violence against police.But there was no such debate in Maywood, whose mayor, Henderson Yarbrough, said the village council  unanimously, proudly  voted to give Hampton his due. There ought to be some footprints in the sand in relation to this man,  said the Rev. Al Sampson, one of about 75 people at the ceremony.  Fred Hampton represents part of the tradition of liberation freedom fighters. Killed in police raid in  69 Maywood s police chief attended the event, along with U.S. Representatives Danny Davis and Bobby Rush, a co-founder of the Illinois Black Panther Party.Hampton, who grew up in Maywood, and fellow Panther Mark Clark were gunned down by Chicago Police in a 1969 raid at Hampton s apartment. Hampton had helped bring the Illinois chapter of the Black Panther Party to national prominence and also brokered a nonaggression pact between gangs. ",politics,"Feb 22, 2016"

It s odd how the Democrats pick and choose who does, and who doesn t qualify as a victim in the United States. Let s just hope no one wears a suicide vest Two senior Democratic lawmakers are asking their colleagues to bring a Muslim-American guest to the State of the Union in protest of Donald Trump s recent proposal to ban Muslims from entering the U.S.In a letter sent to House Democrats on Tuesday, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, and Rep. Keith Ellison, the first Muslim elected to Congress, said lawmakers should bring Muslim-Americans to the Jan. 12 speech as a way to rebut anti-Muslim rhetoric. Over the past few weeks we have seen a shocking and alarming rise in hateful rhetoric against one particular minority population in our nation,  the pair wrote in an email obtained by POLITICO.  Leading political figures have made offensive and outrageous suggestions that we should create a national registry of all people of one particular faith and that we should prevent any person of that faith from even entering this great country. Donald Trump, the Republican front runner for the presidential nomination, said earlier this month that Muslims should be barred from entering the U.S. because of security concerns.

20719,“RACIST” President Jackson To Be Replaced With Black Female Representing “Struggle For Racial Equality” On $20 Bill,"Obama has filled his cabinet with radical  yes  men and women who hold similar anti-American, leftist views. His radical Treasury Secretary, Jack Lew is no exception.  Treasury Secretary Jack Lew is expected to announce this week that Alexander Hamilton s face will remain on the front of the $10 bill and a woman will replace Andrew Jackson on the face of the $20 bill, a senior government source told CNN on Saturday.Lew announced last summer that he was considering redesigning the $10 bill to include the portrait of a woman. The decision to make the historic change at the expense of Hamilton drew angry rebukes from fans of the former Treasury Secretary. The pro-Hamilton movement gained steam after the smash success of the hip-hop Broadway musical about his life this year.Those pressures led Lew to determine that Hamilton should remain on the front of the bill. Instead, a mural-style depiction of the women s suffrage movement   including images of leaders such as Susan B. Anthony   will be featured on the back of the bill.Along those lines, Lew also plans to announce this week that Andrew Jackson   a less beloved former president whose face graces the front of the $20 bill   will be removed in favor of a female representing the struggle for racial equality, according to the government source.That decision would place a female on one of the most widely circulated bills in the world. But the historic change placing a female on the front of the $20 note won t come for more than a decade, the source said, since the process for changing the design of that note is still in the early stages.While some pointed to the many accomplishments and qualities of Hamilton for why he should stay on the currency printed by the very Treasury the man created, the more popular argument for the Founding Father s retention was an argument about how awful the man on the $20 dollar bill was.The Daily Beast described Jackson as  villainous  and linked to a February article that called him a  mass murderer. The New York Post argued that Old Hickory  may well have been our most racist president  and was a  vicious, power-mad kook. So a lot of folks really don t like the victor of the Battle of New Orleans. They hate him for owning slaves. They hate him for taking the side of the masses against financial experts. They hate him for ignoring laws and enforcing his own will when it came to policy decisions.And they hate Jackson most of all for his treatment of American Indians.These are pretty strong views, but Jackson s critics usually fail to comprehend important aspects of U.S. history in their denunciations of the rough-and-tumble general.For one, Jackson was not the only important American to own slaves. Far from it. For example, as most people should know, George Washington and Thomas Jefferson were slaveholders. Both Washington and Jefferson are respectively featured on two different forms of currency and have large, imposing monuments dedicated to their memory in Washington D.C.There are no calls for their erasure from our coins or demolishing their monuments.Fewer people know that the Cherokee   victims of Jackson s Indian Removal Act   also owned slaves.There are no calls for renaming places and monuments designed to honor the Cherokee people.When it comes to Jackson s controversial handling of the Second Bank of the United States, it helps to realize the motives behind the president s actions. Jackson was opposed to the Central Bank not out of cookery but because he saw it as an undemocratic institution which did not care for the interests of the common man. Via: Daily Caller The soonest that a new $20 note will be issued is 2030,  the source said, citing a lengthy process convened by the Advanced Counterfeit Deterrence steering committee, which includes representatives from the U.S. Secret Service, the Treasury, and the Federal Reserve.

16818,SUPREME COURT DECISION Lead By Justice Ginsburg Delivers Blow To Big Business,"Oh boy! Ginsberg woke up and is leading a decision against big business is anyone surprised by this? We d love to know your opinion.WASHINGTON   The U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday issued the first decision in a series of class action cases this term that are widely viewed as attempts by business interests to shut the courthouse door to consumers and everyday plaintiffs.In a 6-to-3 opinion in Campbell-Ewald v. Gomez, a case testing the limits on federal courts considering class-action disputes, the justices ruled that businesses can t just  moot  a case by simply offering to settle it with the person who first brought it   let alone if the person rejected the offer.Relying on contractual principles, Ginsburg said such offers have  no force. Like other unaccepted contract offers, it creates no lasting right or obligation,  Ginsburg said.  With the offer off the table, and the defendant s continuing denial of liability, adversity between the parties persists. That adversity matters because, under the Constitution, federal courts can only hear actual  cases  or  controversies.  But Campbell-Ewald   a marketing firm that was sued for sending unwanted mass text messages   said that requirement evaporated after it offered Jos  G mez, the lead plaintiff in the dispute, some money to make his case go away.G mez had sued Campbell-Ewald, a Navy contractor, for a text message he received from the company recruiting him to join the Navy. But because he was almost 40 at the time and he never consented to receiving the text, G mez alleged in his lawsuit that the company violated a federal law that forbids  unsolicited advertisement. But he didn t want to just go it alone   he wanted to form a class action against the firm.It was at that point that Campbell-Ewald sought to make G mez whole by simply making him an offer it thought he wouldn t resist: a sum of $1,503, or about three times what federal law allowed him to recover. G mez, however, refused to settle and said he wanted to press forward as the leader of the class action.Ginsburg said that was good enough for his claim to remain active in the courts.A person who is  a would-be class representative with a live claim of her own must be accorded a fair opportunity to show  that she can vindicate the interests of others in the class, she said.Practically, this detail is important for the vitality of class actions, which depend on the willingness of people like G mez to become the public face of a lawsuit. If this person or  class representative  somehow falls out of the case   by virtue of accepting a settlement offer or other circumstances   the whole class action runs the risk of falling apart. And not just any plaintiff is ready to act as a backup in federal court.Via: Yahoo",Government News,"Jan 21, 2016"
22898,The Existential Question Of Whom To Trust,"21st Century Wire says Investigative reporter Robert Parry broke many of the Iran-Contra stories for The Associated Press and Newsweek in the 1980 s and has been a featured guest on Patrick Henningsen LIVE at 1100KFNX.  In this report, Robert asks due to mainstream media experts who ve fallen to  careerism , whom can we trust to deliver us the information to describe the world and its conflicts. (Image   Former Secretary of State, Colin Powell addressing the United Nations on Feb. 5. 2003)Robert Parry Consortium NewsThe looming threat of World War III, a potential extermination event for the human species, is made more likely because the world s public can t count on supposedly objective experts to ascertain and evaluate facts. Instead, careerism is the order of the day among journalists, intelligence analysts and international monitors   meaning that almost no one who might normally be relied on to tell the truth can be trustedThe dangerous reality is that this careerism, which often is expressed by a smug certainty about whatever the prevailing groupthink is, pervades not just the political world, where lies seem to be the common currency, but also the worlds of journalism, intelligence and international oversight, including United Nations agencies that are often granted greater credibility because they are perceived as less beholden to specific governments but in reality have become deeply corrupted, too.In other words, many professionals who are counted on for digging out the facts and speaking truth to power have sold themselves to those same powerful interests in order to keep high-paying jobs and to not get tossed out onto the street. Many of these self-aggrandizing professionals   caught up in the many accouterments of success   don t even seem to recognize how far they ve drifted from principled professionalism.A good example was Saturday night s spectacle of national journalists preening in their tuxedos and gowns at the White House Correspondents Dinner, sporting First Amendment pins as if they were some brave victims of persecution. They seemed oblivious to how removed they are from Middle America and how unlikely any of them would risk their careers by challenging one of the Establishment s favored groupthinks. Instead, these national journalists take easy shots at President Trump s buffoonish behavior and his serial falsehoods   and count themselves as endangered heroes for the effort.FOILS FOR TRUMPIronically, though, these pompous journalists gave Trump what was arguably his best moment in his first 100 days by serving as foils for the President as he traveled to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, on Saturday and basked in the adulation of blue-collar Americans who view the mainstream media as just one more appendage of a corrupt ruling elite.Breaking with tradition by snubbing the annual press gala, Trump delighted the Harrisburg crowd by saying:  A large group of Hollywood celebrities and Washington media are consoling each other in a hotel ballroom  and adding:  I could not possibly be more thrilled than to be more than 100 miles away from [the] Washington swamp   with much, much better people.  The crowd booed references to the elites and cheered Trump s choice to be with the common folk.Trump s rejection of the dinner and his frequent criticism of the mainstream media brought a defensive response from Jeff Mason, president of the White House Correspondents  Association, who complained:  We are not fake news. We are not failing news organizations. And we are not the enemy of the American people.  That brought the black-tie-and-gown gathering to its feet in a standing ovation.Perhaps the assembled media elite had forgotten that it was the mainstream U.S. media   particularly The Washington Post and The New York Times   that popularized the phrase  fake news  and directed it blunderbuss-style not only at the few Web sites that intentionally invent stories to increase their clicks but at independent-minded journalism outlets that have dared question the elite s groupthinks on issues of war, peace and globalization.THE BLACK LISTProfessional journalistic skepticism toward official claims by the U.S. government   what you should expect from reporters   became conflated with  fake news.  The Post even gave front-page attention to an anonymous group called PropOrNot that published a black list of 200 Internet sites, including Consortiumnews.com and other independent-minded journalism sites, to be shunned.But the mainstream media stars didn t like it when Trump began throwing the  fake news  slur back at them. Thus, the First Amendment lapel pins and the standing ovation for Jeff Mason s repudiation of the  fake news  label.Yet, as the glitzy White House Correspondents Dinner demonstrated, mainstream journalists get the goodies of prestige and money while the real truth-tellers are almost always outspent, outgunned and cast out of the mainstream. Indeed, this dwindling band of honest people who are both knowledgeable and in position to expose unpleasant truths is often under mainstream attack, sometimes for unrelated personal failings and other times just for rubbing the powers-that-be the wrong way.Perhaps, the clearest case study of this up-is-down rewards-and-punishments reality was the Iraq War s WMD rationale. Nearly across the board, the American political/media system   from U.S. intelligence analysts to the deliberative body of the U.S. Senate to the major U.S. news organizations   failed to ascertain the truth and indeed actively helped disseminate the falsehoods about Iraq hiding WMDs and even suggested nuclear weapons development. (Arguably, the  most trusted  U.S. government official at the time, Secretary of State Colin Powell, played a key role in selling the false allegations as  truth. )Not only did the supposed American  gold standard  for assessing information   the U.S. political, media and intelligence structure   fail miserably in the face of fraudulent claims often from self-interested Iraqi opposition figures and their neoconservative American backers, but there was minimal accountability afterwards for the  professionals  who failed to protect the public from lies and deceptions.PROFITING FROM FAILUREIndeed, many of the main culprits remain  respected  members of the journalistic establishment. For instance, The New York Times  Pentagon correspondent Michael R. Gordon, who was the lead writer on the infamous  aluminum tubes for nuclear centrifuges  story which got the ball rolling for the Bush administration s rollout of its invade-Iraq advertising campaign in September 2002, still covers national security for the Times   and still serves as a conveyor belt for U.S. government propaganda.The Washington Post s editorial page editor Fred Hiatt, who repeatedly informed the Post s readers that Iraq s secret possession of WMD was a  flat-fact,  is still the Post s editorial page editor, one of the most influential positions in American journalism.Hiatt s editorial page led a years-long assault on the character of former U.S. Ambassador Joseph Wilson for the offense of debunking one of President George W. Bush s claims about Iraq seeking yellowcake uranium from Niger. Wilson had alerted the CIA to the bogus claim before the invasion of Iraq and went public with the news afterwards, but the Post treated Wilson as the real culprit, dismissing him as  a blowhard  and trivializing the Bush administration s destruction of his wife s CIA career by outing her (Valerie Plame) in order to discredit Wilson s Niger investigation.At the end of the Post s savaging of Wilson s reputation and in the wake of the newspaper s accessory role in destroying Plame s career, Wilson and Plame decamped from Washington to New Mexico. Meanwhile, Hiatt never suffered a whit   and remains a  respected  Washington media figure to this day.CAREERIST LESSONThe lesson that any careerist would draw from the Iraq case is that there is almost no downside risk in running with the pack on a national security issue. Even if you re horrifically wrong   even if you contribute to the deaths of some 4,500 U.S. soldiers and hundreds of thousands of Iraqis   your paycheck is almost surely safe.The same holds true if you work for an international agency that is responsible for monitoring issues like chemical weapons. Again, the Iraq example offers a good case study. In April 2002, as President Bush was clearing away the few obstacles to his Iraq invasion plans, Jose Mauricio Bustani, the head of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons [OPCW], sought to persuade Iraq to join the Chemical Weapons Convention so inspectors could verify Iraq s claims that it had destroyed its stockpiles.The Bush administration called that idea an  ill-considered initiative    after all, it could have stripped away the preferred propaganda rationale for the invasion if the OPCW verified that Iraq had destroyed its chemical weapons. So, Bush s Undersecretary of State for Arms Control John Bolton, a neocon advocate for the invasion of Iraq, pushed to have Bustani deposed. The Bush administration threatened to withhold dues to the OPCW if Bustani, a Brazilian diplomat, remained.It now appears obvious that Bush and Bolton viewed Bustani s real offense as interfering with their invasion scheme, but Bustani was ultimately taken down over accusations of mismanagement, although he was only a year into a new five-year term after having been reelected unanimously. The OPCW member states chose to sacrifice Bustani to save the organization from the loss of U.S. funds, but   in so doing   they compromised its integrity, making it just another agency that would bend to big-power pressure. By dismissing me,  Bustani said,  an international precedent will have been established whereby any duly elected head of any international organization would at any point during his or her tenure remain vulnerable to the whims of one or a few major contributors.  He added that if the United States succeeded in removing him,  genuine multilateralism  would succumb to  unilateralism in a multilateral disguise Continue this report at Consortium News READ MORE US NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire US FilesSUPPORT OUR WORK BY SUBSCRIBING & BECOMING A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",Middle-east,"May 1, 2017"

And that is expressly forbidden by federal regulations.On Wednesday, Donald Trump lashed out at the retailer Nordstrom for dropping his daughter s product line after months of boycotts and lack of sales made it unfeasible to continue carrying them.My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom. She is a great person   always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible!  Donald J.

This is just a wonderful line. I own some of it. I fully   I m going to give a free commercial here. Go buy it today, everybody. You can find it online. And with those words, Conway broke Federal Code  2635.702, which bans public employees from using their office for private or personal gain, including for family members. Donald Trump did this through Conway and she works for him, making her a public employee.Federal Code  2635.702 specifically states,An employee shall not use his public office for his own private gain, for the endorsement of any product, service or enterprise, or for the private gain of friends, relatives, or persons with whom the employee is affiliated in a nongovernmental capacity, including nonprofit organizations of which the employee is an officer or member.It further states that,  An employee shall not use or permit the use of his Government position or title or any authority associated with his public office to endorse any product, service or enterprise. There are only two exceptions to this rule and neither excuse what Conway did.And that why former ethics czar Norm Eisen called out Conway during an appearance on MSNBC and called for an investigation and penalties. By doing this ad   I have never seen anything like it   it s a violation of the rules, pure and simple. I imagine that you are going to see complaints flowing in. The responsibility to oversee this in the first instance is with the White House counsel, Don McGahn. He s going to need to look at the rules, look at the precedents and decide what range of penalties might apply. And I think the Office of Government Ethics will also have a look at it. So, it s a serious matter. Here s the video via YouTube:Kellyanne Conway and Donald Trump violated federal regulations and ethics rules.

8899, Warnings Issued After NRA Fans Plan To Open Carry Guns Near President Obama,"Once again pro-gun forces in America are trying to intimidate anyone trying to reduce gun violence   even the President himself.Ahead of President Obama s town hall about his executive action to reduce gun violence, warnings were issued about the likelihood of gun fans parading around outside the event brandishing their weapons.President Obama s town hall event on gun violence at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va. on Thursday night is likely to provoke strong emotions. And the school s police chief is warning students and faculty that protesters could be carrying weapons on campus   legally. Please be advised that it is lawful to carry firearms in Virginia, and this includes at public outdoor spaces on our campus,  Thomas Longo, GMU s interim chief of police said in an email to the school s internal listserv. Though students are on winter break, the chief wrote that the University Police  will have officers present to ensure that all protesters remain law-abiding. Over the last few years the so-called  open carry  movement has paraded around with weapons in public as a way for gun extremists to show off to everyone how supposedly macho they are.In some cases, these protesters have taken their weapons into restaurants, supermarkets, and major chain stores like Target. Understandably, most parents don t want to have guns swinging around while they re trying to buy their weekly groceries and some stores have begun to ban the open carry crowd.The NRA   who chickened out when CNN invited them to this town hall   has pushed the president as the gun confiscator-in-chief, when in reality at best Obama has pushed for expanded background checks and limits on gun magazines. Now those who have been teed off by this organization   who pays its executives handsomely from their annual dues   have been driven to brandish guns outside an event under heavy secret service protection.It isn t smart, it s dangerous, and at best it will continue to make the pro-gun side of the debate come across as unhinged extremists.Featured image via Wikimedia",News,"January 7, 2016"
9662,CA FIRE UPDATE: Jesus Fabian Gonzalez Arrested For Suspicion of ARSON In Sanctuary County After He’s Caught Walking Away From Fire With Lighter In Pocket,"Yesterday, a man who is likely an illegal alien was arrested on suspicion of arson in the sanctuary county of Sonoma, where wildfires have devasted the lives of hundreds of thousands of Californians and destroyed structures worth billions of dollars. The only news, however, that most of America will read about today, is news of an unproven allegation by a Democrat Representative from Texas about a conversation President Trump allegedly had with a grieving military widow. This story, of course, is a much bigger story, with actual evidence that points to the very real possibility that the Sonoma County Sheriff s office has, in their custody, the arsonist who s responsible for the largest fire in California s history. It s also quite possible, that without the aid of the local and state government officials, who have gone out of their way to protect illegal aliens living in their communities, we wouldn t even be reading about these horrific wildfires.Sonoma County fires have killed dozens. 172 are still missing and 102,000 residents have been dislocated   about one-fifth of the entire population. The latest financial losses include 3,819 unincorporated parcels with 100 structures valued at $2,016,962,239, and 2,907 homes and 86 commercial units lost in the city of Santa Rosa valued at $1.18 billion.Breitbart   The U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement Agency (ICE) issued a detainer request on the Sonoma County Jail for Jesus Fabian Gonzalez, who was arrested Sunday on suspicion of arson in Wine Country fires that have killed at least 40 residents.Breitbart News reported earlier this week that Sonoma County Sheriffs had arrested Jesus Fabian Gonzalez, 29, at Maxwell Regional Park in Sonoma County after a series of reports of ongoing fires in the region. Mr. Gonzalez was observed around 3:00 p.m. PDT wearing a jacket and walking  out of the creek area and a plume of smoke behind him,  according to the Santa Rosa Press Democrat.LA Times    He was screaming really bad things at the police when he was arrested,  recalled David Moreno, 29, who witnessed the arrest.  He was yelling things like,  I m going to teach you a lesson you ll never forget. Three Sonoma County probation officers patrolling Maxwell Farms Regional Park just before 3 p.m. noticed a plume of smoke rising from an area near the Sonoma Creek, Sheriff s Department spokeswoman Misti Harris said.Gonzalez walked away from the fire as the officers approached, Harris said. Nobody else was in the area,  Harris said.Sonoma County Sheriff s Department deputies followed Gonzalez to a nearby McDonald s. Gonzalez had  previous contacts  with law enforcement, she said.Gonzalez told police he started the fire because he was cold, Harris said. Officers found a lighter in his pocket.*The recorded temperature at the time that the fires started was a balmy 78 degrees.Some homeless people who knew Gonzalez said that he had a habit of setting fire to brush along the creek bed.Tensions were already high in this smoke-filled region, about 25 miles east of Santa Rosa.Local mechanic Shawn Stephensen, 40, said,  A few days ago I was walking down the street with a gas can and someone driving by stopped to say,  I wouldn t be carrying a thing like that around at a time like this. At first I didn t get it,  Stephensen, who knew Gonzalez, said.  Then it dawned on me    Oh yeah, instant felony case. Mr. Gonzalez was booked into the Sonoma County Jail for suspicion of felony arson. His bail was set at a steep $110,000, according to the Sonoma County Sheriff Public Information Officer.Sargent Spencer Crum told Breitbart that Mr. Gonzalez is also on a U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement Agency (ICE) detainer request, despite Sonoma County declaring itself as a  sanctuary county  in May 2014. The county only cooperates with  ICE holds  if the prisoner has been convicted of a felony or any misdemeanor offence that falls within the Trust Act within the last five years. Mr. Gonzalez s immigration status has not yet been announced.The American Civil Liberties Union argues detainers are a violation of  unreasonable searches and seizures  under the U.S. Constitution s Fourth Amendment.The Sonoma County Sheriff Department s  1.0 Policy Statement  reads:  No person shall be held solely on the basis of their immigration status.  The policy adds that  the immigration status of a person, and the lack of immigration documentation, should have no bearing on the manner in which Sheriff s Office personnel execute their duties. Gonzalez is being held on bail of $110,000, according to Sonoma County booking records   $10,000 for the felony arson charge, and $100,000 for a bench warrant issued in Ventura County.Gonzalez was scheduled to be arraigned Monday in a county jail facility because the courts were closed due to the disaster. The arraignment was closed to the public and media.Sonoma County Sheriff Rob Giordano on Tuesday afternoon tried to tamp down speculation that Gonzalez was responsible for fires that have killed more than 40 people in Northern California and destroyed thousands of homes.Sonoma County Sheriff Rob Giordano on Tuesday afternoon tried to tamp down speculation that Gonzalez was responsible for fires that have killed more than 40 people in Northern California and destroyed thousands of homes.

5506, LISTEN: Dispatch Audio Reveals Cop Who Killed Philando Castile CLEARLY Racially Profiled,"As much as Jeronimo Yanez, the police officer who killed Philando Castile, wants to claim he didn t pull over Castile s vehicle because of race, audio from police dispatch that night tells a very different story.According to Castile s girlfriend Diamond Reynolds, in the livestream video she took that night, they were pulled over because of broken tail light. However, after revealing that he was legally carrying a firearm, but then reaching for his wallet to show identification, the officer panicked and shot Castile several times.The St. Anthony Police Officer claims that he shot Castile because of  the presence of that gun and the display of that gun,  which still has yet to be determined, but why the car was pulled over in the first place seems a lot more clear after listening to the audio from dispatch.Officer Yanez says: I m gonna stop a car. I m gonna check IDs. I have reason to pull it over. Then he says: The two occupants just look like people that were involved in a robbery. The driver looks more like one of our suspects, just  cause of the wide set nose. It was a minute and a half later when shots rang out and Castile died from his injuries in front of his girlfriend and his girlfriend s daughter. All because Castile  looks  a certain way according to the cop who killed him.This isn t okay, and justice needs to be served.Listen to the police dispatch audio here:Here s a portion of the #PhilandoCastile dispatch call released by #KARE11 pic.twitter.com/4J5TzVcLUk  BallerAlert (@balleralert) July 10, 2016Featured image via video screen capture",News,"July 11, 2016"
13718,WATCH: JUAN HERNANDEZ Tells How He Was CHASED And BEATEN By Anti-Trump COWARDS Who Sucker Punch People And Run In Packs,"This is what happens when you cross the Left. Sadly, this is how unions have been operating for decades. Mainstream America is about to see the ugly truth about the violent tactics of the Left. Anyone who could vote for a party who represents itself in such a manner should be ashamed. By Juan Hernandez   A Hispanic Trump supporter who lives in Santa Clara, CA.Last Thursday, I left work about 5 p.m. and drove to the San Jose Convention Center to hear Donald Trump speak.I ve been voting for conservative candidates for 15 years and a registered Republican since 2015. Now that the general election is underway, I believe Trump is the best candidate to fix our country s many problems, and I believe he s going to be the next commander in chief. So I was excited to hear him, and to show my support. Walking into the rally with a friend, I was a little wary: Trump s speech to the California Republican convention in Burlingame had been disrupted by protesters, and I wasn t sure whether to expect a similar scene in San Jose. But we got to the event early, and we must have been inside already by the time a crowd of protesters gathered in the streets near the convention center.The speech really got me energized. I got a new sense of appreciation and respect for Trump after a Bernie Sanders supporter interrupted him with a sign. Trump didn t blink:  Darling, there s no way he can win, but keep your sign high,  he said. That is the president that I want. It was great being around so many Republicans   in the Bay Area, we don t have a lot of that, so it was great to feel the camaraderie of being part of the GOP.My trouble began once the rally was over.My friend and I joined a crowd of Trump supporters who had all left the convention center around the same time. The garage where we had parked our car was right next to the building, but police were directing everyone around the block to another garage entrance instead. The farther we walked, the fewer Trump fans were with us   people began peeling off to go to restaurants or bars in the area, or to other garages nearby.And suddenly, there were protesters everywhere. Some were holding Mexican flags, or burning American ones. They were yelling  F  Trump!  at us and cornering us. Some of them started grabbing Trump supporters   they were going up and slugging people, sucker-punching people, just picking random people out. As much as we wanted to help, because our fellow Republicans were getting hit, I knew any moment that could be me. So my friend and I just kept walking   sometimes, we d be running. We saw police standing nearby, but they didn t do anything. That scared me, because I thought,  Okay, if I m next, there s going to be no cops. About a block from the garage entrance, we turned down the street and found a line of protesters standing in our way. To get back to our car, we d have to go through them. My friend and I were wearing  Make America Great Again  Trump hats. We were targets, and I was terrified. I could feel it coming   they would look at me and start walking up to me.Before we could make it into the garage, four or five men surrounded me, and another four surrounded my friend. They just started swinging. We swung back as best as we could. My main thing was I didn t want to fall; I didn t want to be knocked down. I m not a big guy, but I can defend myself as best I can if it s one on one   but not when they have so much anger against us.One of the blows caught my nose, and blood just started pouring out. That kind of stunned them, and they backed off a quick second. My adrenaline kicked in; I felt punches on my head, and I felt the punch that hit my nose, but I was in survival mode by then, and I didn t realize until later how much it hurt. I called my friend,  Okay, let s go! We ran into the parking garage, and we thought we were safe, but there were another few dozen protesters there, too. We got in our car and headed toward the exit. Some protesters jumped on the cars in front of us, but we eventually made it out. My friend drove me to the emergency room because my nose was pouring blood. I had a broken nose, and because I was covered with scratches, I had to get a tetanus shot, too. It took a lot out of me, much more than I realized at first; my headaches and soreness didn t start to go away until a week later.WATCH HERE:I still can t believe how poorly the police handled the protests. I live by Levi s Stadium, where the Super Bowl was. They had every single cop out there. Yet knowing the violence that s been breaking out near Trump rallies, San Jose wasn t prepared for it last week? So the Los Angeles chapter of Log Cabin Republicans held a news conference back in San Jose on Wednesday, to get some answers from the city s mayor, Sam Liccardo, and its police department about why they let me and other people get attacked and only made a few arrests.The whole thing made me angry. Here in Northern California, I feel like I m a unicorn: I m a gay Hispanic who s a Republican. It was much harder to come out as a Trump supporter than it was to come out as gay   the minute you say you re for Trump, everyone comes at you   but this has pushed me out of the closet about it completely.I should be able to vote for whom I want, and I shouldn t have to deal with violence to go hear my candidate speak. If people really want to protest at rallies, they should do it peacefully. I have a young niece and nephew, and I don t want them to think this is how politics work in the United States. We can t let our freedom of speech and our freedom of assembly be tarnished by politicians like those in San Jose who do not have our safety at heart.

11657,JAPANESE SCHOOLS DON’T EMPLOY JANITORS…Why Americans Should Demand Our Schools Adopt The Same Policy [VIDEO],"Watch NPR employee and Afghanistan refugee (who was eventually arrested) join others as they block our newly appointed Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos from entering a school in DC on her first day on the job:Back in 2011, Newt Gingrich was running for president, and he proposed a radical idea to help schools cut costs: Fire the janitors and pay students to do the cleaning.Needless to say, the idea to turn students into moonlighting janitors had about as much support as Gingrich s presidential campaign.But ask Kim De Costa and she ll say there isn t anything radical about asking students to clean up after themselves. At her school, there are no janitors. Instead, students in grades 6-12 meet in teams once or twice a week to clean assigned areas.De Costa is the executive director of the Armadillo Technical Institute. It s a public charter school in Phoenix, Ore., a few miles from the California border.For 30 minutes after lunch, students sweep, mop, take out the trash and even clean the bathrooms   but responsibilities rotate so no one is stuck scrubbing toilets more than two or three times a year.De Costa says it s easy to encourage students to respect their environment when they re the ones responsible for preserving it. We really wanted a school where the students took ownership and made it their own,  says De Costa, who helped found ATI in 1999.The school still has maintenance staff for the difficult or dangerous work. But for the most part, students at ATI handle the daily upkeep. And with a little help from peer pressure, the school stays clean.Eden Cox, a 10th-grader, says that recently she had to confront a classmate after he left a mess behind.  I got on to him and said,  Can you please throw your trash away so I don t have to,    Cox recalls. After all, it s our school,  she says, with an emphasis on  our. Places like ATI that build cleanup into the curriculum are rare in the United States.But in Japan, there s a long tradition of students cleaning their own schools.There,  school is not just for learning from a book,  says Michael Auslin   a former English teacher in Japan.  It s about learning how to become a member of society and taking responsibility for oneself,  says Auslin, who is now a resident scholar and director of Japan studies at the American Enterprise Institute.To make cleaning easier, Japanese students put on slippers before entering the classroom to prevent dirt from being dragged into the room.Many Hands Make Light WorkAt Brentwood Academy outside Nashville, Tenn., keeping the school spick-and-span is just part of the daily routine for students.Each day before P.E., students at the private prep school report for 10 minutes of  clean-up  duty in their assigned areas.Susan Shafer, the school s director of communications, considers  clean-up  an additional component of the school s mission of educating the whole person. We re trying to train them for life,  says Shafer.  They re all going to go to college. No one is going to clean their dorm room for them. Maddie Jarrard, an 11th-grader, is responsible for dusting a classroom every day. She says even after sports games, Brentwood players are expected to stay behind to pick up any trash left in the stands. They re not only trying to keep the place clean,  says Jarrard, referring to Brentwood s staff.  But they re also trying to build character in each student. While some parents might balk at the idea of a school taking time away from class to make students push a broom, educators at both ATI and Brentwood both say that parents have shown overwhelming support.

5985," RNC Shoots Out Weak, Loser-y Response To Seeing $1.3 Million Ad Buy Dumped By Buzzfeed","How damaging is Donald Trump? Just ask the Republican National Committee. They ve lost out on a lucrative advertising deal with Buzzfeed because Trump is offensive. Media outlets need advertising dollars to function, so the fact that Buzzfeed would give up any ad money at all, just to stand on principle, says a lot about how awful Trump really is. The RNC has to be smarting from that.Their response to this is as weak and watery as their reluctant decision to accept Trump as their nominee and standard-bearer. According to CNN, the RNC s chief strategist and spokesman, Sean Spicer, said: Space was reserved on many platforms, but we never intended to use BuzzFeed. It is ironic that they have not ruled out taking money from a candidate currently under investigation by the FBI. Excuses, excuses. It s like they re back in kindergarten and saying,  I didn t want to be your friend anyway!  in order to save face. And by all means, invoke the investigation into Hillary s email server to smear Buzzfeed and deflect attention from the real problem, which is Trump. That just compounds the flimsiness of their response.Earlier on Monday, Buzzfeed CEO Jonah Peretti explained in a letter that they won t accept Trump ads because Trump is dangerous. He compared Trump ads to cigarette ads, saying that they don t run cigarette ads for that same reason. They don t want to be seen as endorsing something that s fundamentally bad for them and for us.Peretti is especially concerned about Trump wanting to limit freedom of the press, ban Muslims and get rid of immigrants: The Trump campaign is directly opposed to the freedoms of our employees in the United States and around the world and in some cases, such as his proposed ban on international travel for Muslims, would make it impossible for our employees to do their jobs. They do intend to continue covering Trump, though, and their coverage is brutal enough for him to specifically target them at rallies and elsewhere. The RNC, though, doesn t want to look like they re sucking on sour grapes over this, but they can t avoid it now. Such a shame   our hearts bleed pink carbonated peanut butter for them.Featured image by Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"June 6, 2016"
17056,American Workers Finally Fighting Back Against Corporations Replacing Them With Cheaper Foreign Labor,"THE H-1B VISA PROGRAM IS KILLING JOBS FOR NATIVE AMERICANS! It was just reported in the recent jobs numbers that native-born Americans are losing jobs while immigrant employment is up. Corporations like Disney are bringing in foreign workers with the H-1B visa and having the American employees train the foreign worker for their job. Talk about adding insult to injury! This needs to stop but Washington lobbyists and the Chamber of Commerce really can t help themselves they love that cheap labor. The discrimination against Americans is very real and it s about time the workers fought back!Some U.S. IT workers who have been replaced with H-1B contractors are alleging discrimination and are going to court. They are doing so in increasing numbers.There are at least seven IT workers at Disney who are pursuing, or plan to pursue, federal and state discrimination administrative complaints over their layoffs. Another Disney worker, still employed by the firm, has filed a state administrative discrimination complaint in California. These complaints are a first step to litigation.Separately, there are ongoing court cases alleging discrimination against two of the largest India-based IT services firms, Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services. The federal judges in each of cases have given a green light for the plaintiffs to proceed after rejecting dismissal efforts.There may be federal interest in examining this issue. The U.S. Department of Justice s Office of Special Counsel for Immigration-Related Unfair Employment Practices was asked by 10 U.S. senators in April to examine the IT layoffs at Southern California Edison (SCE) and to determine whether SCE or its contractors were  engaged in prohibited citizenship status discrimination. What s being challenged, in sum, is the job replacement system created by the H-1B program. U.S. IT workers, as a condition for their severance, are being made to train H-1B visa-holding contractor replacements to take over their jobs.The contractors often work for IT services firms that employ large numbers of H-1B workers. Most of these workers are from India and regional countries. This practice of replacing U.S. workers with foreign workers constitutes national origin discrimination, say its critics.The court case against Tata, whose plaintiffs include a former SCE employee, alleges that some 95% of its employees are South Asian or mostly Indian. Tata has called the allegations baseless.The Disney IT workers  were terminated because they were American citizens and all their replacements were foreign-born Indians,  said Sara Blackwell, a Florida attorney, who is representing seven of the Disney workers at its parks and resort division. She has set up an organizationto challenge the practice. Other discrimination claims, including age and disability, will be made as well. Those complaints are being filed with the U.S. Equal Opportunity Commission, which sees if a settlement is possible prior to any lawsuit.Disney did not respond immediately for comment. We need to protect American workers,  said James Otto, a California attorney who is representing a Disney ABC Television Group employee in that state. This complaint is being filed in California under the state s Fair Employment and Housing Act, which Otto said is similar to the federal process, but with more protections.Otto s client still works at Disney and had been targeted for an earlier layoff, but Disney rescinded those layoffs. Nonetheless, the complaints being made include a hostile workforce and national origin discrimination.Read more: Computer World",Government News,"Oct 7, 2015"
8056," The Oregonian Calls Out Racist Commenters, Racist Commenters Explode (IMAGES)","Racism is pretty prevalent on the interwebs. Generally, if an article even mentions something to do with Black culture, the racists are out in force. This happened so frequently on articles regarding hip-hop and the like on the Oregonian, which is, by the way, the west coast s largest paper, that one of their writers decided to address the problem of racism in their comments sections.The piece, entitled  Dear Readers: Stop Being Racist About Hip Hop, rips the racists in the comments sections to shreds. The writer of the article, David Greenwald, first talks about how he is no longer shocked at the racism he encounters, even on the supposedly liberal west coast, then goes on to treat his readers to a sampling of the racism in his comments sections, and even in his email inbox:I got an email over the weekend about our recent Kanye West stories. No subject. It didn t need one.  This is news?  the reader wrote.  About some n  rapping?  Every time the Oregonian covers hip-hop music, a rich and beautiful American art form invented to share the pain and joys and narratives of inner-city black lives over 30 years ago, readers comment with hatred. Here, from Monday night alone, enjoy a few choice notes about Kendrick Lamar, the most important musician currently working in American music and new winner of five glimmering Grammy awards: Best  rap album? That, my friends, is a world class oxymoron,  Yardbird tells us. Not since Kanye West, has an individual with so little talent, been so worshiped and idolized by so many. Even a superstar like Adelle has been sucked into this clown s,  Music,'  DonRon adds. Adele is spelled with one  L : she is also a blues singer who owes everything to the African-American creativity that birthed hip-hop.And that s just for starters. Greenwald then goes on to try to educate the ignoramuses that make up so much of his readership on the beauty and riches that hip-hop culture has given America. However, at the end of the day, he says he understands that he cannot school people determined to be so ignorant. He ends the piece by saying: If you dismiss hip-hop culture, if you paint it all with the same ignorant brush, if you say  hip-hop masterpiece  is an oxymoron, if Beyonc  and Kendrick Lamar and Kanye West are just too black: you are a racist and you are wrong, and this will be the last time I write for you. And good for him. Unsurprisingly, the very racists who need to take what Mr. Greenwald is saying into account completely missed the point of the article, and responded with   gasp!   more racism. First, there were the ones whose response was to disparage the writer and the work of the hip hop artists, all the while using racist language:Then, of course, there was that one person who just had to pop out and declare themselves an expert on all things black because he once knew a black person:And of course, those are just what is there as of this writing, with the article being quite new. I am sure the ugly and ignorance will continue. Unfortunately, though, at the end of the day, the very people who needed to hear David Greenwald s message have turned a deaf ear, and will remain as ignorant as they were prior to reading his brilliant piece.Featured image from video screen capture from The Oregonian",News,"February 16, 2016"
3526, Trump Gets PUMMELED During TODAY Show Interview; Matt Lauer Did NOT Hold Back (VIDEO),"Ever since Matt Lauer threw Donald Trump some majorly softball questions during his Q&A with the president-elect during the campaign, many people have been criticizing how he didn t go hard enough on Trump to get some real answers.Well, Lauer clearly got the message, albeit a little too late, because he just absolutely went after Trump during a phone interview on the TODAY show Wednesday morning.Lauer said: You seem to understand that perhaps having fights on Twitter would not be appropriate for the president. I have not seen you backing off fights on Twitter  In the time since you were elected, you ve targeted the cast of Hamilton, The New York Times, China, Boeing, the media, and SNL. Which, of course, put Trump on the defense pathetically trying to explain how going after SNL and a Broadway show are somehow justified. The president-elect also seems to think that Twitter is an appropriate form of communication, no matter how immature the tweets. He also, again, went after SNL, and when Lauer brought up the fact that he had previously hosted the show, Trump whined that it s gone downhill since then.Sure, Donald, that s it.Good on Lauer for finally being tough on Trump.Watch Lauer really press Trump here: WATCH:  I like Alec, but his imitation of me is really mean-spirited and not very good.  @realdonaldtrump on #SNL https://t.co/NEslxLZJuS  TODAY (@TODAYshow) December 7, 2016Featured image via video screen capture",News,"December 7, 2016"

5696, Fox News Attacks LGBT Community With Disgusting Story Saying They’re After Young Children," LGBT Crowd Eyes Preschool Children.  That s the vile headline on a story republished on Fox News from capital bigot Laura Ingraham s site, Lifezette. The headline was crafted specifically to make people recoil in horror due to the misbegotten idea that the LGBT community is all about pushing the  homosexual agenda  onto our children. Below is a screen capture of the story sitting on Fox News  website, for all to see:The story itself almost waxes poetic on the dangers of LGBT indoctrination, attacking a series of online videos called  Queer Kids Stuff.  That series intended to help parents talk to their children about the LGBT community in a way that s easy for them to understand. Bigoted, homophobic conservatives, however, see this as predatory, claiming that the only way the movement wins is by going after ever-younger groups of children.The videos haven t made their way into preschools yet, but that s exactly what Sean Ryan, the communications director of Mass Resistance, an alleged  pro-family  group, is afraid of: It is easily conceivable that videos such as these will be sanctioned eventually by local school boards and implemented in preschool and prekindergarten classes.Activists are trying to force these topics on younger and younger children because that is the only way their movement wins.Rational adults don t buy into the so-called  Queer Theory  or transgenderism. Unfortunately, children are a soft target for homosexual activists as they are malleable and still learning about the world. We have to wonder who these rational adults are, and whether he even knows the definition of  rational,  since he clearly isn t. Chances are he means narrow-minded, extremist fanatics like himself, who think that the LGBT community needs to go back into the closet and stay there, so we can all go back to pretending they don t exist, like we used to. Ryan even alluded to that in the story: There was once a time when it was unthinkable to even mention the topic of homosexuality in a school setting. Now, there are homosexual, bisexual [and] transgender lesson plans for kids as young as kindergarten. He believes that the reason today s parents might support something he views as gross is because they, themselves, were indoctrinated and don t even realize it. There s no way of convincing someone this close-minded and black-hearted that nobody was brainwashed, except, perhaps, them.The New Civil Rights Movement said that Fox News should change the headline. They should, but they won t, because it says exactly what they want to say.  It s all about the children, we swear!  the haters scream. It s not, and saying that the LGBT community is after our children is a dangerous lie and a half.Featured image by Scott Olson/Getty Images and Fox News website",News,"June 27, 2016"

18542,ALARMING: NSA Refuses to Release Clinton-Lynch Tarmac Transcript with Lame Excuse,"If Clinton and Lynch just talked about grandkids then why is this such a top secret transcript? This is troubling because it portends to what we ve known all along Bill Clinton was meeting with Lynch to fight Hillary s battle. They won t reveal it because it would implicate so many people in government Are we right?A citizen researcher from Florida is attempting to have the recording of the infamous Bill Clinton/Loretta Lynch tarmac tape released to the public, but apparently, the National Security Agency claims they won t release it due to  national security. The man researching and seeking to have the tape released is Florida orthodontist Larry Kawa. You may remember him because of Judicial Watch s filing of a lawsuit on his behalf to obtain a week s worth of Hillary Clinton s emails regarding Benghazi.It s being reported now that the NSA has declared the recording of the conversation that took place between Bill Clinton and Loretta Lynch in Phoenix, Arizona on June 27, 2016.Judicial Watch filed a Freedom of Information Act request in March of this year to obtain the following:Any and all records and/or transcripts of a meeting held between Attorney General Loretta lynch and former President Bill Clinton on June 28, 2016.Any and all records of communication sent to or from officials in the Office of the Attorney General regarding the meeting held between Attorney General Loretta Lynch and former President Bill Clinton on June 28, 2016.Any and all records of communication sent to or from officials in the Office of the Deputy Attorney General regarding the meeting held between Attorney General Loretta Lynch and former President Bill Clinton on June 28, 2016.Any and all references to the meeting held between Attorney General Loretta Lynch and former President Bill Clinton contained in day planners, calendars and schedules in the Office of theAttorney General. This brings us to Kawa. In an article at Big League Politics, Patrick Howley writes:The National Security Agency (NSA) blocked the release of a purported tape of Bill Clinton and former Attorney General Loretta Lynch s private airplane talk with a rare legal justification used to protect top national security secrets.The NSA s block of the release of this information   citing one of President Obama s executive orders   undercuts Hillary Clinton s claim that her husband and Lynch had a  purely social  conversation about grandkids and golf on June 27, 2016, two weeks before Lynch dropped the Department of Justice investigation into Hillary Clinton s email scandal.Read more: Freedom Outpost",left-news,"Jun 3, 2017"

INDIEGOGO HOSTS FUNDRAISER FOR BLACK MAN AND BANK ROBBER WHO MURDERED WHITE COP AND MARINE VETERAN [Video],"Because #BlackCopKillersLivesMatter right?Supporters of Tremain Wilbourn, the Memphis ex-con accused of shooting Officer Sean Bolton when he interrupted a drug deal on Saturday night, have started an IndieGoGo campaign to funnel money to him and his family.Wilbourn turned himself in after a two-day manhunt.  I want you to know that one, I m not a cold-blooded killer and two, I am not a coward,  he reportedly told Memphis Police Director Toney Armstrong. The campaign repeats his claims and says that cops are waging  terrorism  on black communities, and so they have to support ex-cons who kill.The description of the campaign reads in full:This year, police have killed 558 people. 68% of those people were black. Most of them were unarmed. Police brutality and terrorism on the black community remains largely unchecked and less than 1% of those police officers who murder black people without cause are charged with murder or manslaughter.Tremaine Wilbourn turned himself in to police on Monday, August 3rd for fatally shooting a police officer during a traffic stop and he wanted to make clear two things: one- he is not a cold-blooded killer, and two- he is not a coward. While the murderers of Freddie Gray, Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner, 12 year old Tamir Rice, Sandra Bland and countless others are free to enjoy their families and lives, these men are no longer among the living.These barbaric, unjustified murders of black men, women, and children are supported under the rule of law. We have to step up and support our people like the murderers of these men, women, and children have been supported. Please donate anything you can to support Tremaine s children and his family during this difficult time for them.So far, the campaign has raised $116 with 12 funders out of its stated $61,000 goal. We have to support our people,  the campaign s founder,  PK EI  wrote as a comment.  If Darren Wilson can raise enough to put his children through college twice, we should be able to put together this change for Tremaine s family. We Should Always Support Our Own People, Especially When The Situation Is Grime And Questionable, Or When We Are Completely Within Our Rights. Because We Are All We have To Support Us,  reads another from user  thinkanotherway. The campaign declares that Wilbourn did in fact, shoot Bolton to death. If nothing else, its adherence to IndieGoGo s community guidelines is questionable:  Indiegogo is not a place for hatred, abuse, discrimination, disrespect, profanity, meanness, harassment, or spam,  the community guidelines read.  Do no [u]se the Services to promote violence, degradation, subjugation, discrimination or hatred against individuals or groups based on race, ethnic origin, religion, disability, gender, age, veteran status, sexual orientation, or gender identity. IndieGoGo did kill an April campaign helping a cop accused of murder: South Carolina police officer Michael Slager, charged for shooting fleeing suspect Walter Scott to death. Our Trust & Safety team regularly conducts verifications and checks and this campaign did not meet their standards,  the company said at the time.Via: Breitbart News",left-news,"Aug 4, 2015"
9893,PBS HOST ASKS HILLARY:“Do You Believe The President Is Racist?…Her Answer Proves That She Is The REAL Racist [VIDEO],"PBS host Judy Woodroof asked Hillary if she believed President Trump is racist? Hillary pauses for effect and then delivers her very scripted answer to Woodruff:  Here s what I believe, I believe that he has given a lot of encouragement and rhetorical support to the Ku Klux Klan, he accepted the support of David Duke. Hillary knowingly pushed the lie that Trump accepted the support of KKK member David Duke. It s the same lie she s been peddling since Trump became her opponent in the presidential race, even though she knows there isn t one shred of evidence or proof to back up her sick claim. Her answer to Woodruff is nothing more than a lame attempt to pin Trump a false allegation on our sitting President while deflecting from the truth about her ACTUAL ties to the KKK. Watch Hillary attempt to paint President Trump as a  racist .When President Trump was dropping out of the Reform Party primary in 2000, he clearly condemned David Duke during an interview with Matt Lauer.When pressed by Matt Lauer on why he saw the Reform Party as self-destructing, Trump commented: Well, you ve got David Duke just joined, a bigot, a racist, a problem, I mean, this is not exactly the people you want in your party. Watch Trump s 2000 interview with Lauer here:What Hillary Clinton didn t mention to Judy Woodruff during her interview, was that her presidential campaign received more than $20,000 in donations contributed by members of the Ku Klux Klan. Vocativ reported that a prominent member of the hate group Will Quigg of the California Grand Dragon for the Loyal White Knights said,  For the KKK, Clinton is our choice . Mr. Quigg, the leader of the Klan s California chapter, announced last month that he had abandoned supporting Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump in lieu of backing his likely Democratic opponent. The Klansman claims that members have raised more than $20,000 for Mrs. Clinton and have donated it anonymously to her campaign.  She is friends with the Klan,  Mr. Quigg told Vocativ.  A lot of people don t realize that. Hillary never made any secret of her love and admiration for her  mentor,  the late Klan leader Democrat Senator, Robert Byrd.In a video uploaded to the State Department s official YouTube page on June 28, 2010, Clinton commemorated late Sen. Byrd by saying,  Today our country has lost a true American original, my friend and mentor Robert C. Byrd. ",politics,"Sep 16, 2017"
2681, WATCH: Melissa McCarthy Adds To SNL’s Trump Admin Ridicule In GLORIOUS Sean Spicer Spoof,"Saturday Night Live is having a high old time ruthlessly mocking the governmental train wreck that is the fledgling, incompetent Trump administration. First, they returned Alec Baldwin to his role as Trump, and re-enacted his absolutely disastrous first two weeks in office. Then, they debuted Melissa McCarthy as White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer   specifically his bizarre meltdown where he scolded the press regarding Trump s continuing obsession with having a smaller inaugural crowd size than President Obama did.McCarthy appeared in an ill-fitting suit, much like the one Spicer wore to tear into the press during his very first official appearance as Press Secretary, and yelled and screamed, and even swallowed bunches of gum, in a mockery of the report that Spicer has a problem where he eats and swallows copious amounts of Orbit cinnamon gum daily. As he does this, McCarthy/Spicer says: I m here to swallow gum and take names! When challenged by a reporter at one point, McCarthy/Spicer took out a super soaker gun and shot the reporter with water. The spoof even had McCarthy/Spicer pick up the press podium and attempt to attack reporters with it. The erratic press secretary insisted on apology from the press for how they are treating Trump   and him: Apologize to me! That apology is NOT accepted! This is hilarious, but it is also scary, considering how close it is to the person who is currently serving as the actual White House Press Secretary.Watch the clip below:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"February 5, 2017"

At the end of the video, Bev Harris, the founder of BlackBoxVoting.org gives a few suggestions about how we can help to fight and identify voter fraud. Please don t let this video discourage you from voting. Not every vote is going to be hacked, and not every precinct is using a GEMS system. If you live in a precinct that has an electronic voting machine, remember you may ask to vote with a paper ballot.Here is the full version of the video that has been shortened (below). The only fault in this video is that Bev Harris is working under the premise that the only people who steal votes are primarily white Republicans.We ve worked as poll challengers in Pontiac, Michigan in a polling place that housed 3 voting precincts. We witnessed unbelievable voter fraud that appeared to be strictly in favor of the Democrat party candidates. Voter fraud is not a Republican, Democrat, Independent, White, Black, Hispanic or Asian issue it s an issue that every American citizen should be concerned about. We should all be willing to take whatever action is necessary to protect the sanctity of our vote. Get involved. Be a poll challenger or poll watcher. Find out if you can be a witness to counting the absentee ballots in your area. Becoming active in thwarting voter fraud has never been more important than it will be in this upcoming election.Here is the shortened version:",left-news,"Oct 31, 2016"
6574, Uncle Tom CNN Guest Attacks Larry Wilmore: ‘What If Someone Called Sanders The K-Word?’ (VIDEO),"There s often much debate about the use of the n-word in any of its forms. You hear in rap music, or just among black folks as a term of familiarity in some black culture circles. This debate has been brought to light once again by Larry Wilmore s comedy routine at the White House Correspondents  Dinner. The comedian finished his bit by saying directly to President Obama: Yo, Barry. You did it, my n*gga. Well, there was one member of the black media who did not appreciate Wilmore s remarks, and he went on CNN with host Don Lemon to say so. SiriusXM host Joe Madison said of Wilmore: Can you imagine if the K word would have been used to describe Bernie Sanders?  The thing is, though that is not an accurate comparison. Most people don t even know what the K-Word is. For the record, it is an anti-Jewish slur. The word is  Kike.  Jewish people have never included this word in their own culture without it being a million percent offensive in any context. The same cannot be said for the n-word. Now, do I use it in any context? No. Absolutely not. I m black, but I despise that word for my own reasons. However, I do understand that there are contexts within Black circles where it is a term of endearment and is completely appropriate. This one of them.Madison went on to say that it was a sad occasion that after 8 years of this dinner, that s the last word that this distinguished group of people will hear in relation to this president. The second guest in the debate, April Reign, said that Madison was misguided on this one. She put it perfectly when she said that black folks need to stop worrying about the  white gaze  in response to such things. The thing is, worrying about what white folks think will get you far in life, because we live in such a racist society. However, playing that hand is, in and of itself, racist. Reign also went on to point out the obvious, which is that President Obama appreciated what Larry Wilmore said. I am sure he did. People do not like to admit it, but almost every minority you can think of has its own culture where its people are more comfortable. I know that I am, for example, much more comfortable in a gay bar than I could ever be in a straight club. Know why? Because those are my people. They get it. They get the experience. The same goes for how I feel with a bunch of black folks versus being with a bunch white folks. I am sure President Obama appreciated the cultural significance of what Larry Wilmore said, because for the last eight years he s not be able to be with his own people.Joe Madison and everyone else taking issue with Wilmore s routine really need to see themselves for what they are: Uncle Toms who want to distance themselves from black culture, which is seriously just a damn shame.Watch the video below:https://youtu.be/BK7k5kJEmxEFeatured image via video screen capture",News,"May 3, 2016"
21651,"ILLEGAL ALIENS WHO LIED TO COURT, USED FAKE SS#’s AND COMMITTED FELONIES Are Granted Special Privileges Because They Are Considered “Victims”","You can t make this up! Why are these criminals who illegally entered our country are being given special status? They are not expected to live by the same rules as US citizens and are being fast-tracked to citizenship. Meanwhile, others who are waiting in line to become American citizens and have followed the rule of law would likely be deported for committing the same crimes as these illegals from Mexico and South America.U.S. District Court Judge Sandy Mattice sentenced eight illegal aliens to two years of supervised probation Wednesday morning. The eight were earlier found guilty of illegally entering the United States and of knowingly committing perjury by signing an I-9 form and stating that they were eligible to work in this country.Each had also purchased false and fraudulent documents such as Social Security cards and green cards which they used to gain employment.The light sentences and lack of a deportation order came about due to each of the defendants having earlier been issued a U visa by the Department of Homeland Security, the judge said.Judge Mattice described this type of visa  as for lack of a better word, a reward,  for assisting a U.S. agency prosecute another federal case   in this instance against Durrett Cheese Sales, Inc. of Manchester, Tn. Their assistance, which was challenged by Assistant U.S. Attorney Gary Humble as  questionable at least,  was due to their part in a human trafficking case against Durrett Cheese. The case proved to be one that was not prosecutable.According to court documents, the defendants, Luciana Moreno-Lopez, Maria Ramirez-Mendoza, Flora Rivera-Pablo, Teresa Ayala-Rosales, Cirilo Castillo-Amaro, Meremedios Cervantes-Cano, Sarai Contreras-Martinez and Mercedes Eugenio-Gomez were arrested by the Coffee County Sheriff for criminal trespass on Oct. 22, 2007. They were arrested after their employer was unable to pay them and they refused to leave company property until they were paid.Upon their arrest the sheriff determined that they were most likely illegal aliens and then notified Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents.ICE contacted the United States Attorney s Office for help in investigating possible human trafficking and other possible violations of federal law. Several of the defendants were interviewed by ICE agents and a representative of the Department of Justice s Human Trafficking Section of the Civil Rights Division. Also participating in the interviews was a representative of the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) . The SPLC had made the allegations that the defendants were victims of human trafficking.The court documents state:  Based on the defendants  statements and other investigation, it was obvious that there was no prosecutable human trafficking case.  This was pointed out by prosecutor Humble during sentencing when attorney Clay Whittaker, defense counsel for Ms. Moreno-Lopez, requested probationary sentencing for his client by saying that she had provided and continued to provide the government with assistance.Mr. Humble stated,  The defendants have not provided any reasonable assistance to the government; in fact, they basically refused to implicate anyone (in the company s management hierarchy). Each of the defendants received a sentence of two years supervised probation on each of three counts, to be served concurrently. A special fine of $300 was waived by Judge Mattice in each case based on the defendants  inability to pay.In a previous case involving this matter, former Durrett Cheese Sales, Inc. employee, Shanna Ramirez, was convicted of conspiracy to commit social security fraud (count 1); aiding and abetting social security fraud (count 2); and false declarations before the grand jury (counts 4 and 5). She was sentenced on Dec. 23, 2009 by Judge Mattice to 15 months of incarceration. In another related case, Montano-Perez was sentenced on March 1 to two years probation.The SPLC had filed a claim on the defendants  behalf with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) while the defendants had applied for the U visas from the Department of Homeland Security.The eligibility requirements for a U visa or U non-immigrant status are, according to U.S. State Department directives, strict. This status is, in part, a recognition by Congress that a category of non-citizens is so vulnerable that it deserves protection in the form of legal status and a path to citizenship. A U visa holder is entitled to four years of non-immigrant legal status in the U.S. The holder of such a status may apply for permanent status three years after being granted a U visa.U visas are issued to illegal aliens when they have been judged to have been substantially abused and are helpful or willing to help designated agencies, including law enforcement agencies, in the detection, investigation or prosecution of crimes.According to U.S. Code, the purpose of the underlying statute is not to create a blanket amnesty or to legalize everyone who claims victim status. The Act s Congressional purpose is demonstrated in three aspects of the enabling legislation and its history: (1) the U visa as a tool for law enforcement; (2) the U visa as humanitarian relief for those who are helpful to law enforcement; and, (3) the U visa as protection for workers who suffer crimes in the workplace.In their original claims to the EEOC, the defendants, under penalty of perjury, falsely denied committing the crimes for which they had been arrested. According to a brief filed by the U.S. Attorney, they had, in fact, committed these and many other crimes before applying for the visas. The EEOC, based upon their claims, designated each of the defendants a  victim  and informed DHS that their presence was necessary to enable them (EEOC) to conduct an investigation.The EEOC then closed its investigation, but did not notify DHS that the defendants  presence in this country was no longer necessary. When it was not notified by EEOC, DHS moved ahead and granted the U visa status to all eight defendants.It is the U.S. Attorney s Office view that the defendants were not victims of any qualifying crimes or that they have not suffered any substantial abuse   mental of physical because of qualifying criminal activity The U.S. Attorney believes that  the defendants have been able to manipulate the system to achieve legal status, despite their illegal entry and the commission of felony crimes.

7870," Wealthy Man Passes Away, Leaves Millions To Open Ohio Animal Shelter","The news cycle has been filled with bad news lately, and it s wearing on us all. We have an income gap that keeps getting wider, a horrible reality star on his way to possibly becoming president, mass shootings, terrorist attacks and all sorts of other awful stuff that makes us shake our heads when we turn on the news. So, it s always nice when we can bring you news that will warm your hearts and make you smile   and the following story will do just that.David Robert Wetzell (known as  Bob ), of Urbana, Ohio passed away and left his entire estate to establish an Animal Welfare League in Champaign County. According to the executor of his estate, Ronald Tompkins, Wetzell left instructions for him to liquidate his estate   worth about $3 million   and build the shelter, but with very specific guidelines.Wetzell left instructions in his will for Tompkins to sell his assets and use the money to establish the shelter and purchase a secluded farm in Champaign County. It is to be used as an animal preserve, pet cemetery, dog training facility and rehabilitation home for unwanted pets.The new shelter will be modeled after Animal Welfare League of Clark County in Springfield which was established in 1959 and currently houses 90 cats and 45 dogs. Libby Adams who runs the Clark County shelter with her husband said: I know it will take a while to build up to what we have. It s not going to happen overnight. Ours took a few years to get to what we have now Bob was very fond and proud of our organization. He would come down on occasion. He was a member of our league for as long as I can remember and supported us. She said that he often told her that he wanted to open one up when he was alive, but he didn t know how to go about getting it started.Wetzell had no human family members except a few distant cousins, but he was survived by six cats, a 20-year-old parakeet, a dog and seven chickens. Tompkins kept the dog and found homes for his other pets.It is awesome that Wetzell did something like this with his estate. There are so many animals that need a home, and this sounds like it is going to be a pet paradise. I wish there were more people in the world like him.

4994, GOP Starts OPENLY Admitting That They Royally Screwed Themselves Over By Choosing Trump,"Trump s appointment of Breitbart chief Steve Bannon, along with his decision to have at least two people at the top of his campaign who will let him run amok, has further frightened and infuriated Republicans to the point where they re finally seeing reality about the candidate they put at the top of their ticket. As the layers of their delusions continue to be peeled back, former Minnesota Rep. Vin Weber says: Look, we are in a terrible position. The Republican Party has made a mistake of historic proportion and when you do that, you find yourself in a place with no good solutions. Trump s idiocy has started to affect down-ticket races all across the country, particularly in the Senate. Senators in tight races saw their numbers drop considerably between August 3 and August 15. This is good news for Democrats, but the GOP s continued insistence that Trump will, ultimately, work for them is rapidly becoming a pipe dream.It s hard to feel sorry for them over that, though, because they re the ones who stuck themselves with a candidate who can t even run a cohesive campaign. In fact, Weber sees conniving manipulation in Trump s decision to have three people managing his campaign: We now have a CEO, a campaign chairman and a campaign manager. That tells me that no one is in charge of this campaign. Trump is playing these three people against each other. Indeed, since the campaign manager is still Paul Manafort, Trump could be playing him against the other two. When Manafort replaced Corey Lewandowski as campaign manager back in June, everyone saw it as a sign that Trump was ready to take on the mantle of campaigning for the general election. They expected a pivot, effected in part by Manafort.But he s not pivoting, and he won t. Manafort failed miserably there. Since Trump s strategy of alienation worked so well during the primaries, he can t see any reason at all to change: I am who I am. It s me. I don t want to change. Everyone talks about  oh are you gonna pivot?  I don t want to pivot. I mean you have to be you. If you start pivoting, you are not being honest with people. That s a laugh coming from the man who spreads lies as easily as people spread the common cold. It s even sillier coming from someone who s trailing so badly in the polls that he s reduced to tweeting the ones where he s only a couple of points behind Hillary.His campaign is quickly becoming the only Republican entity that s still mired in the delusion that he can win anything at all. Hell has frozen over: The GOP is starting to admit, outright, that they fucked themselves sideways with a rusty chainsaw in nominating Donald Trump for president.Featured image via Ralph Freso/Getty Images",News,"August 18, 2016"

They see horror stories, they see events you couldn t see in a movie, nobody would believe it. First of all, if Trump needs to talk about who has a mental health problem, he should just look in the mirror to see a clear narcopath.

It s unclear if Gianforte will be charged with the assault, but attacking a reporter literally a day before an election is unprecedented. The local sheriffs department was seen taking witness statements.It s not clear what caused the assault, but Ben Jacobs had recently caught Gianforte secretly investing $250,000 in several US-sanctioned Russian companies. It seems likely that the two things are linked.This assault happens less than 24 hours before polls open in Montana. The seat is meant to replace former GOP Rep. Ryan Zinke who Trump picked to run the Department of the Interior. Trump selected Zinke in part because Republicans believed that no Democrat could win the deep-red Montana seat   then Trump got into office, destroyed his credibility and that of the Republican Party and now the Democratic challenger Rob Quist has a real chance of winning.Naturally, the Trump family is linked to Gianforte. Add this to the numerous scandals and bad characters they ve attached themselves too. Trump s son, Don Jr. showed up at several Gianforte rally to help try to secure the seat for Republicans. The two have become close, spending quality time together during a recent a gopher hunting vacation. Seriously.And the audio just dropped.

Qureshi specializes in healthcare fraud and securities violations.Not only is Qureshi a partner at Latham & Watkins (a position he s held since 2006), he is the global chair of the firm s Pro Bono Committee, and serves on the Legal Ethics Committee of the District of Columbia Bar.An accomplished lawyer, who happens to be Muslim, will not get his day in the Senate (should the obstructionist Republicans allow it) and make history.And of course conservatives are going to be furious when they find out that   gasp   Muslims can serve in public office! Fortunately to sanity and justice, the United States Constitution has a No Religious Test clause under Article VI: ;but no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States.So say the Founders, who seemed to be very cordial and accepting of Muslims.The United States Constitution has this clause to ward off hateful bigots who think their religion is the only one that matters, and President Obama is taking full advantage of it, and rightfully so. Qureshi isn t qualified because he s a Muslim, he s just a qualified attorney who happens to be Muslim.Here s to hoping history will once again be made, and Republicans will give this man a fair hearing and a speedy up-and-down vote.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"September 7, 2016"
15504,DISNEY’S ESPN PUNISHES TRUMP FOR FREE SPEECH…Isn’t It Time America Punished DISNEY For Putting Their Leftist Agenda Before Free Speech?,"Disney s just doing their part to advance a radical leftist agenda by punishing conservatives and anyone who dares to challenge their views ESPN has become the latest corporate entity jump on the pig-pile on Donald Trump.Following moves by Macy s, NBCUniversal, and NASCAR to distance themselves from the presidential candidate, ESPN has decided to move an annual golf tournament honoring late North Carolina State basketball coach Jim Valvano from the Trump National Golf Club. We decided it was appropriate to change the venue, and are grateful for the opportunity to stage the event at Pelican Hill on short notice,  the network announced in a statement.  This charity outing benefits The V Foundation s Stuart Scott Memorial Cancer Research Fund, providing resources for important cancer research for minority populations, including Hispanics and African Americans. Our decision reflects our deep feelings for our former colleague and support for inclusion of all sports fans. Diversity and inclusion are core values at ESPN and our decision also supports that commitment. Corporations seeking to limit speech have tangled with the businessman-turned-politician since his remarks critical of illegal immigration that came during his presidential announcement last month. When Mexico sends its people, they re not sending their best,  Trump maintained on June 16.  They re sending people that have lots of problems, and they re bringing those problems with us. They re bringing drugs. They re bringing crime. They re rapists.

167, Racists’ Heads Will Explode When They Find Out White-On-White Crime Is Higher,"Despite what many racists say and regardless of the hand-picked statistics of the federal government in an effort to demonize black people, the rate of white-on-white crime in the United States is far higher than that of African-Americans victimizing white citizens.In a report published last Thursday by the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) on  Race and Hispanic Origin of Victims and Offenders 2012-2015,  some staggering figures emerged. Research conducted over a four year period during which  U.S. residents experienced 5.8 million violent victimizations each year  found that the rate of white-on-white violent crime (12.0 per 1,000) was almost four times higher than black-on-white violent crime (3.1 per 1,000).However, even when the facts are blatantly obvious and staring them right in the face, there is no swaying some Republicans who still subscribe to the idea that African-Americans are still the largest threat to themselves and others. Case in point: former White House advisor Sebastian Gorka in this interview last Monday:On a Sinclair station, Gorka refers to ""black African crime on black African crime"" & says black men are killing each other ""by the bushel"" pic.twitter.com/Cbtqm39tTd  Yashar Ali ? (@yashar) October 24, 2017Indiana Attorney General Curtis Hill, an African-American himself, shares the same sentiments as Gorka. One of the most dramatically difficult things to fathom in this country is the amount of lives lost   black lives lost   as a result of black-on-black violence,  Hill said on Saturday. In the same year that we experienced about 259 police officer shootings of blacks in 2015, there were 6,000 black lives lost to murders from black people. However, contrary to what both Mr. Gorka and Mr. Hill believe, black men aren t killing each other  by the bushel.  In fact, according to the report, black-on-black violence has decreased exponentially in the last two decades, by almost the exact same rate as white-on-white violence. From 1994 to 2015, white-on-white violence and black-on-black violence declined at a similar rate. White-on-white violence declined 79 percent (from 52.5 to 10.8 victimizations per 1,000 white persons). Black-on-black violence declined 78 percent (from 66.6 to 14.5 victimizations per 1,000 black persons). Information on Hispanic origin of offenders was not collected prior to 2012,  the report stated.It s time that the U.S. government started to report the facts when it comes to the issue of race, instead of dividing the country.Featured image via Brian Blanco/Getty Images",News,"October 30, 2017"

9803,WATCH: MEGYN KELLY HUMILIATES HERSELF (AGAIN)…Tries To Cozy Up To Traitor Jane Fonda…Gets Major SMACKDOWN On Live TV,"  One day after actress Debra Messing revealed that she regretted going on Megyn Kelly s new NBC morning show, the embattled host managed to draw the ire of an even bigger Hollywood star.Megyn sat down with Oscar-winning screen icon Jane Fonda on Wednesday, and in an ill-advised and poorly conceived move, decided to ask the 79-year-old actress to detail the plastic surgery she has had done over the years.The nasty exchange on day 2  of Megyn Kelly s new job at NBC couldn t have taken place between two more self-serving and arrogant women.Watch: You, you ve been an example to everyone, on how to age beautifully and with strength.

429," AG Sessions Persuaded Trump To End DACA, Then Race-Baited His Way Through The Speech That Killed It","It s certainly no secret that Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III, a man named after both the president of the Confederacy and the guy who actually started the Civil War, is an unholy racist. Like, he s so racist that the wife of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., actually delivered a letter to Congress pleading with them not to confirm him as a U.S. attorney 31 years ago.So it s no surprise to find out that Sessions was the driving force behind convincing Donald Trump to end DACA, the temporary deferment program for undocumented immigrants that protects them from deportation if they came here as children. Sessions sees no difference between an  illegal alien  who steals a car and one who may sit next to one of his 10 grandchildren in school one day.So imbued with the essence of Jeff Sessions was the Trump decision to boot nearly a million kids out of the country in less than a year s time that it was the AG himself who delivered the speech announcing it. And it was during that speech on Tuesday that the former senator from Alabama revealed the truth behind the decision to end DACA: That despite the fact that even many Republicans favor the basic protections that DACA affords, it is racism that serves as the foundation for undoing it. From the speech: The effect of this unilateral executive amnesty, among other things, contributed to a surge of unaccompanied minors on the southern border that yielded terrible humanitarian consequences. It also denied jobs to hundreds of thousands of Americans by allowing those same jobs to go to illegal aliens. This is a direct appeal to the racist tendencies of the Americans who put Donald Trump in office.Number one, the  surge of unaccompanied minors  that Sessions refers to began well before DACA was implemented. To suggest otherwise is a dog whistle to right-wing voters. A BBC report from 2012 showed that the number of unaccompanied minors who were apprehended near the border increased from October 2011 to March 2012 by 93% over the same period in the previous year. DACA was not implemented until June of 2012. Besides that, any who came after DACA was announced wouldn t have qualified in the first place. You had to have been in the United States at the time of implementation to benefit from the executive order.Number two, Sessions brings up the myth of the job-stealing immigrant. The theory, again an appeal to racists, is ridiculous from the start. Immigrants don t even look for the same jobs as native citizens. There is no evidence to support the claim that DACA has had any effect on jobs   other than as a boost to our economy. In fact, with the job losses that will come as DACA expires   something to the tune of 30,000 workers a month   employers stand to lose billions in training new employees, and the federal government will lose tens of billions in lost revenue and GDP.But those facts don t jibe with the Sessions narrative.Don t let the mini-quarrel that Trump and Sessions got into earlier this year fool you. They both have a racist agenda, and this is the first major step in implementing it.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"September 5, 2017"
6013, Trump Adds Muslims To List Of Minorities He Thinks Shouldn’t Be Allowed To Be Judges (VIDEO),"After widespread, bipartisan outrage and several high profile calls by Republican colleagues to knock it off, Donald Trump decided instead to triple down on his racist comments about the judge presiding over his Trump University fraud case   and then start adding other minority groups that he also feels can t be trusted.During a sit down with CBS s John Dickerson on Face the Nation, Trump said it was  common sense  to keep minorities out of positions of authority or else they might be biased against people like Trump. When Dickerson pressed Trump to justify his overtly racist attitudes by using a hypothetical Muslim judge instead of a Hispanic one, the Republican nominee said he would similarly ask that a Muslim recuse himself under the assumption that given what he has said about Muslims, the judge would be unable to give him a fair trial.It led to this mind-blowing exchange: Isn t there sort of a tradition though in America that we don t judge people by who their parents were and where they came from?  Dickerson replied.And Trump countered again,  I m not talking about tradition   I m talking about common sense, OK? Trump has repeatedly insisted that he really does stand behind the accusations that the judge in his case, Indiana-born Gonzalo Curial, is a  Mexican  hater who wants to punish Trump for his promise to build a wall on the border. Now he has expanded it to Muslims as well. What group is next?Clearly a position that in more decent times would disqualify a candidate, instead Republicans have opted to tsk tsk Trump while at the same time pretend to believe that what he said isn t racist, just  brash.  It s unclear whether even they buy that particularly pathetic excuse.There is, of course, little need to debunk Trump s offensive approach to the justice system, but a UCLA law professor summed it up nicely: Trump s theory is, apparently, that anyone can get any judge disqualified for  conflict of interest  just by saying things that the judge finds offensive enough,  Volokh wrote.  Don t like the Jewish judge on your case? Say things that are critical of Jews, and now the judge presumably has to step aside because of a conflict of interest. Don t like the female judge? Say things that women tend to find offensive. Don t like the judge who was a Republican activist? Say nasty things about Republicans. In other words, the only person Trump thinks is qualified to judge Trump is Trump. Or perhaps, men who share his same skin color.Watch Trump s egregious comments below:Would a Muslim judge also be out of the question here? @realdonaldtrump:  It s possible, yes.  https://t.co/49qUfRCrLV  Face The Nation (@FaceTheNation) June 5, 2016Featured image via CBS",News,"June 5, 2016"
2280, Man Behind Trump’s Insane Claim That Obama Tapped His ‘Wires’ Just Admitted He Made Sh*t Up (VIDEO),"Donald Trump is now demanding that any probe into his administration s connections to Russia also include a probe into his wild allegation that President Obama tapped his  wires  in Trump Tower. This dubious claim seems to have originated with a Breitbart article that had been circulating among White House staff. The article in question claimed that President Obama had ordered a wiretap under the Foreign intelligence Surveillance Act, which allows a secret court to authorize surveillance in cases that involve agents of foreign powers   in this case, Trump and two Russian banks.The article heavily referenced claimed made by conspiracy theorist Mark Levin on his far-Right radio show that  we absolutely know this is true  that Obama was monitoring Trump s team during the campaign. But now that his ridiculous allegations are being scrutinized by people who aren t completely batsh*t insane, Levin is doing everything he can to walk them back while still maintaining credibility with the Stupid Part of America.During an appearance on Fox News Sunday, Levin called for a release of FISA court applications that may or may not exist as well as all of the daily presidential intelligence briefings for the last  year or so.  He added that this massive conspiracy that suddenly popped up when the Russia situation was becoming too much for the Trump Team to handle wasn t limited to Obama. Every single Democrat, according to Levin, was involved in trying to take Trump down.Asked about the level of President Obama s involvement, Levin gave himself a huge  out :I m not Nostradamus here. I just think that we ought to find out.In other words, he is pulling his claims out of thin air. Via a spokesperson, President Obama cleared up his level of involvement on Saturday   There wasn t any. A cardinal rule of the Obama administration was that no White House official ever interfered with any independent investigation led by the Department of Justice,  the spokesman said. As part of that practice, neither President Obama nor any White House official ever ordered surveillance on any U.S. citizen. Donald Trump is being attacked for [the accusations] he tweeted,  Levin said, failing to note that he was the source of those allegations.  Donald Trump is the victim, his campaign is the victim, his transition team is the victim, his surrogates are the victim. These are police state tactics. To some degree, Levin is correct   but not in the way he thinks. Trump has recently been demanding investigations of his critics. Members of his administration have also threatened to  investigate  journalists who do not write nice things about The Donald. One Trump administration member confirmed that President Asterisk was compiling  dossiers  on journalists he views as unfriendly. All of these things could very accurately be described as  police state tactics    but we re guessing Levin meant something about his favorite bogeyman, Barack Obama.Levin admits there is no basis for his claim but that doesn t matter to Donald Trump or conservatives at large. By making the allegation knowing that people who can only be described as  idiots  would eat up, the Republicans are demanding answers   and they will not be satisfied with any that do not paint Barack Obama as the monster they have known him to be ever since they realized he was black.Featured image via screengrab",News,"March 5, 2017"

Perhaps no one told Newsweek that both of these beautiful, and yes, feminine women, happened to be successful businesswomen long before Donald Trump ever decided to run for President Newsweek attacked President Donald Trump s female relatives for wearing high heels in public in a piece published Thursday, saying it showed they were subservient to men. Melania, Ivanka, and Ivana Trump Wear High Heels, a Symbol of Everything That Is Beautiful and Horrifying About Them,  read the headline. The female consorts of the Leader of the Free World do not set foot in public without first molding their arches into the supranatural curve that Mattel toy designers once devised for Barbie s plastic feet,  the author complained.Newsweek argued that high heels are designed primarily to attract men, not for the comfort of the women wearing them. So to deconstruct why Trump women wear high heels: They are just buying into traditional binary views of male and female,  British psychologist Paul Morris opined. High heels thrust out the buttocks and arch the back into a natural mammalian courting,  an American anthropologist agreed.  Rats do it, sheep do it   lions do it, dogs do it. It is a naturally sexy posture that men immediately see as sexual readiness. [Heels] are a  come-hither  signal. When women wear high heels at work, they send sexual signals that should be avoided if they want to be taken seriously,  she said.Newsweek further noted that the first women to wear high heels were  Italian prostitutes in the 17th century  and that  the high heel was a staple of Victorian porn. Stiletto pumps are the ultimate test of a certain type of femininity.

But this was just an innocent 17 year old boy minding his own business when he was faced with the awful decision of whether to risk his own life and save the life of a total stranger or stand back and watch an elderly woman be killed. This hero chose to sacrifice his own life. If we lived in a world where real heroism is not celebrated because it s not controversial. In a good and decent world, Raekwon Juaquay Brown s name would be more of a household name than that of thug Michael Brown. But we live in a world where the Left celebrates victimhood and real or imagined, a good victim can always be used to prop up a cause. #RIP Raekwon Juaquay Brown you are a hero. Seventeen-year-old Raekwon Juaquay Brown sacrificed his life when he pushed an elderly woman out of the way of gunfire before he was slain in Wednesday s daylight shooting near Jeremiah E. Burke High School, the grief-stricken lady told the Herald just hours before a vigil honoring the young hero. He saved my life   I have a new life,  the woman, 67, said in Spanish yesterday while tears streamed down her face. He was only 17. I ve lived here 10 years, I ve never seen anything like this. There needs to be more police here,  she said, showing a wound to her right ankle, where police say she was grazed.The woman was one of four people struck by gunfire in the 1:15 p.m. ambush that left Brown, a Burke High junior, dead. Her name is being withheld by the Herald because she is a witness to the murder.She explained she was in an alley by a pizza shop when the shooting broke out. The teen, who was sitting down eating a hamburger, got up and pushed her to the side by a car, she claimed.Last night hundreds of people, including at least a dozen family members, crowded in front of the market on Washington Street less than a block from the school where Brown fell.Some men turned and walked away in tears while several women dabbed their eyes with tissues from a box that was being passed around. Brown s mother, Wanda Graddy, supported by several relatives, walked toward a memorial for her son, where she cried,  My boy, my boy. The Rev. William Dickerson of the Greater Love Tabernacle Church spoke first and called for the killer to step forward and for witnesses to name him. We pray that justice will come in the midst of this terrible reality,  Dickerson said.Family members said they hope that whoever pulled the trigger will surrender. Stop being cowards,  said Raekwon s older brother, John Brown.  Stand up like a man. Take your consequences. Beside him was the slain teen s godmother, Jacqueline Cane. I just want you to know, whoever did it, turn yourself in,  she said.  You re not going to sleep until you turn yourself in. That was a good guy here. This was my God-baby. Seventeen years old, you took his life. Turn yourself in or you will never rest. Mourners said another prayer and then hugged as they departed.Burke school staff also took time out from the day to recall Brown as a selfless teen. Raekwon was probably one of the most loving and caring students I have ever had in the Sophomore Academy,  said Cheryl Windle, leader for the academy.  He actually had this warmth about him that I really believe captures his true essence. He will truly be missed by all of us here at the Burke community. Lindsa McIntyre, headmaster of Burke, said students and staff will miss Brown dearly.  He came to us as a vibrant, struggling, middle school student, looking for fun and full of vim and vigor. But as he grew in his high school career, he became a metamorphosis for what a real Burke student looks like. Via: Boston Herald",politics,"Jun 10, 2016"
1515," Dan Rather Blasts GOP For Protecting Trump, Gives Them A Tongue Lashing They’ll Never Forget (VIDEO)","Legendary journalist Dan Rather has become a major critic of Donald Trump and the GOP, and if there s anyone who should be commenting on the firing of FBI Director James Comey, it s him.On MSNBC s Hardball with Chris Matthews, Rather weighed in on Trump s shady behavior in firing Comey right as the Russia investigation was heating up. In his appearance, Rather said he wanted the Republican Party to take a good look at themselves and figure out why they refused to hold Trump accountable when it s blatantly obvious that this is a cover-up.In speaking with Matthews, Rather called Trump s termination of Comey a  smoke screen  and stated that the Russia scandal needs to be done by an independent commission with a special prosecutor, which many people are calling for. Rather said: [The Comey firing], it s smoke screen, it s cover. I ll be very surprised if it fools very many among the American people.   What s needed here are some Republican leaders. Republicans have the White House, they have the Supreme Court, they have the Congress. This is going to require some Republican officeholders with guts who say to themselves,  I want the Trump administration to succeed, I want my party to succeed, but more importantly, I want to do what s good for the country.  And they know, in that secret place behind their hearts that what s good for the country is an independent, bipartisan commission with a special prosecutor. Rather has always nailed it when it comes to analyzing Trump, and he did it again. It s obvious that Comey s firing was meant to be a distraction, and everyone seems to acknowledge this except for the GOP. The Republican Party s tendency to look the other way and protect their own is hurting the country and will have serious consequences if something is not done immediately.The best thing Republicans can do now is act like grown ups and forget about getting one over on the Democrats so that Trump s issues can be dealt with. America s democracy cannot be played with, and should not be compromised because the GOP refuses to work with others.

Gabbard, who called for additional debates between the two democratic candidates back in October, appears to have concerns about the inner workings of the DNC.During a telephone interview with the New York Times, Rep. Gabbard said, When I first came to Washington, one of the things that I was disappointed about was there s a lot of immaturity and petty gamesmanship that goes on, and it kind of reminds me of how high school teenagers act. She went on to say, It s very dangerous when we have people in positions of leadership who use their power to try to quiet those who disagree with them. When I signed up to be vice chair of the D.N.C., no one told me I would be relinquishing my freedom of speech and checking it at the door. Last month, Sanders was endorsed by former head of the DNC, Mark Kirk.Image credit video screen capture from Meet The Press on Twitter",News,"February 28, 2016"
4261," BREAKING: Trump’s Taj Mahal SHUTS DOWN, Thousands Of Jobs Lost (DETAILS)","Donald Trump called the Atlantic City casino that he is so fond of, the Taj Mahal, the  eighth wonder of the world.  Now, the joint is shutting down   likely for good. The shutdown comes after more than 100 days of striking on the part of union workers from the luxury hotel and casino. As negotiations went from difficult to impossible, it became official: there s no going back, and the Taj Mahal is closing.This really isn t surprising, considering that Trump is the king of bankruptcy, and has declared himself bankrupt four times. Despite his own ridiculous record, Trump told the Associated Press with regards to the casino s closing that there was  no reason  for it to close. However, he also says it will cost too much to re-open, so it s done.However, Trump s billionaire buddy, Carl Icahn, who operated the Taj Mahal, just might be using the cold months to do some negotiating in an effort to save the place and re-open it. This is a theory that the union president, Bob McDevitt, is running on. According to McDevitt, the re-opening after renovations and other improvements is a  strong possibility. The Taj Mahal s closing will cost Atlantic City 3,000 jobs, bringing to the total to 11,000 jobs lost as a result of casino closings in the last two years. However, the workers who are on strike seem optimistic, despite the loss of their jobs and many admittedly being in financial trouble with the holidays coming. Tina Condos, who served cocktails at Trump s joint, says: We stood up to a billionaire and told him we wouldn t take it. I hope it gives him pause before he tries to come in and do this to anyone else. We feel like we succeeded here. Rose Hall, who took care of the rooms at the adjoining hotel, says: I gave most of my adult life to this place. I had to pay for health care out of my own pocket, and if you don t think that s expensive, you haven t looked. I lost my fiancee to cancer just when medical insurance came off the table for us.I m angry about what s happened, but I m not sad about what we did. I m at peace with myself. The last word on the situation from the point of view of the union workers  president, Bob McDevitt is that the workers were in the midst of their Popeye moment:  That s all I can stands; I can t stands no more.  For the first time in 30 years, workers stood up to Carl Icahn and made him throw in the towel. Well, good on these workers, and may they find other means of employment soon.Featured image via Bobby Bank/Getty Images",News,"October 10, 2016"
5256, Trump Gives An Absolutely Jaw-Dropping Answer To The Threat Of Cyber-Attacks,"How do you stop cyber-attacks? Well, if you re Donald Trump, the solution is very, very simple. It s so simple it s amazing nobody else has thought of it. Trump must think he s the genius of the world for thinking of this. He believes that stopping cyber-attacks is as simple as no longer using computers, let alone the Internet.No, really, he pretty much said that at a rally in Colorado just yesterday. It s almost laughable if you can get through his word salad: I like the old days, especially for the military, on things like that. You wanna attack or you wanna do something? It s called courier. It s called, let s put it in a thing in an envelope and let s hand it to the general. Let s not send it over the wires where everybody s probably reading it, right? And no matter how good, no matter how good they say it is, it s not. I mean, people can hack it I guess. It s terrible. I know and if you talk about military and you talk about secrets, you talk about politics.  [emphasis mine]Because that s totally realistic in this day and age of information technology. Trump is remarkably regressive   he s also said he doesn t use email all that much because he s  just not a believer in it.  As for his nonstop Twitter use, the jury is out on whether he does that himself or not. He s told some outlets he does, and he s told others that he has staffers do it.So who knows what he really does with Twitter? His policy on cyber security, though, is absurd on its face. There is no getting rid of electronic communication; there is no getting rid of the Internet in the name of security. There is no going back to outmoded means of communication in the name of security. It is just not happening.But don t tell that to Trump, because he probably won t hear it. This is the man who asked Bill Gates to close up the parts of the Internet that the Islamic State uses, as if Bill Gates runs the whole entirety of the Web by himself. And, of course, Trump thinks the Internet is ours, so closing up parts of it to keep hostile powers from using it should be easy.The man is clueless. His lack of even the most rudimentary understanding of how the Internet works is astounding.Featured image by Joe Raedle/Getty Images",News,"July 30, 2016"

4916, Catholic Insurance Company Refused To Allow Woman With IUD To Be Treated,"It s not even a slight exaggeration to say that when the Supreme Court decided that right-wing religious bigotry can take precedence above pretty much everything else, including common sense, they were setting some people up to die.28-year-old Melanie Jones, who lives near Chicago, didn t die, but only because she was lucky. She made the mistake of visiting her doctor, one her healthcare plan wanted her to visit, when she began bleeding heavily because her IUD became dislodged. Her doctor refused to remove her IUD, even though something more dire could still happen, because the doctor was Catholic. I think my first feeling was shock,  Jones told Rewire in an interview.  I thought that eventually they were going to recognize that my health was the top priority. It wasn t just her doctor. According to Jones and two complaints filed by the ACLU, the entire hospital couldn t help Jones out because it was a Catholic hospital. In fact, no one in her entire insurance network could help her. She had no idea that she had signed up with a Catholic healthcare network (Blue Cross Blue Shield).The doctor left Jones to confer with colleagues, before returning to confirm that her  hands [were] tied,  according to two complaints filed by the ACLU of Illinois. Not only could she not help her, the doctor said, but no one in Jones  health insurance network could remove the IUD, because all of them followed similar restrictions. Mercy, like many Catholic providers, follows directives issued by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops that restrict access to an array of services, including abortion care, tubal ligations, and contraception.The only way Jones had left to get her IUD removed and to stop the bleeding was to spend $1,000 out of pocket in the emergency room. She did successfully contact the ACLU, who intervened on her behalf with the insurance company. They finally, five days after her initial appointment, found a doctor who would remove the IUD.Now, we all know that current Catholic doctrine, at least how it s currently interpreted, is that birth control is strictly out of the question, but what about removing birth control? That, apparently, is a gray area. Her doctor maybe could have removed the IUD without violating policy, but she apparently didn t want to risk it.Now, to be fair, IUD expulsions are rarely dangerous, but they can perforate organs. There are plenty of situations, though, when saving a life could violate religious law (Christian Scientists don t believe in blood transfusions, any religious person can claim they can t treat an LGBT person, or sometimes even an LGBT couple s children).Featured image via Flickr",News,"August 24, 2016"

Well, we think she thinks she s a BIG deal now. How do we know? She charges $30K to speak! Who would pay a penny to hear this commie speak?A college in her hometown would pay this except they re going broke!That s a whopper of a bill for a university in her hometown that s going broke. There was an outcry when is was discovered that she would speak and charge $30K. Someone came forward to donate the fee but wouldn t it have been a great move on her part to donate the money to the failing university?Valerie Jarrett found herself in hot water in her adopted hometown for agreeing to take a $30,000 speaking fee from a public university that s going broke, a new report said Tuesday.President Obama s longtime adviser and confidante eventually waived the fee for delivering a commencement address at Northeastern Illinois University in Chicago after an outcry over the hefty payment, Politico reported.The university shut down over spring break and also announced unpaid furlough days for staffers, the most recent in a string of measures taken to fight financial woes caused by a lengthy partisan state budget debate.The Chicago Sun-Times first reported the details in Jarrett s contract, and that a private donor agreed to pay her fee once university leaders raised objections. While keenly aware of the financial challenges in Illinois, we were not aware of the specific issues facing Northeastern Illinois University or that a donor would be paying for the speaking fee,  Amy Brundage, a Jarrett spokeswoman, told Politico. Jarrett notified [University] President [Richard] Helldobler this morning that she will not be accepting a speaking fee for the commencement address. Jarrett looks forward to addressing the graduates and other members of the NEIU community next month. NEIU board members were not amused about the deal paying so much for a speaker at a time the school is cutting programs and struggling to survive.Read more: NYP",left-news,"Apr 11, 2017"
1726, Stephen Colbert SCORCHES Jeff Sessions’ Racism In One Brilliant Tweet,"Late Show host Stephen Colbert is no fan of Donald Trump and his administration of bigots. Therefore, he was, of course, incensed at Attorney General Jeff Sessions  racist attack on a sitting federal judge regarding Trump s bigoted Muslim Ban.Judge Derrick Watson infamously blocked Trump s Muslim Ban 2.0, and in the decision he said the whole thing read like a   neon sign flashing  Muslim ban, Muslim ban. On Thursday, Sessions went full dog whistle when he criticized Judge Watson s decision, saying the following: We are confident that the president will prevail on appeal and particularly in the Supreme Court, if not the Ninth Circuit. So this is a huge matter. I really am amazed that a judge sitting on an island in the Pacific can issue an order that stops the president of the United States from what appears to be clearly his statutory and Constitutional power. Of course, that brings back the fact that accusations of racism have dogged Sessions for decades, and rightly so. He is a throwback to a time we really should be trying to get away from, and here he is, the nation s top law enforcement officer. Shameful, but true. Therefore, Stephen Colbert s tweet on the matter is more than fitting:Sessions is ""amazed"" an ""island in the Pacific"" judge can block the travel ban. Just like how I'm ""bewildered"" a ""racist elf"" can be AG.  Stephen Colbert (@StephenAtHome) April 21, 2017That is exactly what Jeff Sessions is   a stone cold racist.

4476, WATCH: Megyn Kelly Takes A Shot At Hannity By Wondering When Trump Will Talk To A Real Journalist,"Fox News host Megyn Kelly seemed to take a shot at Sean Hannity on Monday night after the much anticipated first presidential debate when she had to throw the live coverage to an interview between her colleague and Republican nominee Donald Trump.Hannity has been a prime target for just about everyone ever since Trump was formally nominated during the last night of the Republican National Convention in July. Former Daily Show host Jon Stewart got the ball rolling that night by torching Hannity for being a complete hypocrite when it comes to how he has covered President Obama in the past to how he treats Donald Trump now.Not long after that, Wall Street Journal foreign affairs columnist Bret Stephens called Hannity the  dumbest anchor on Fox News,  and the Washington Post followed up by calling Hannity out for lying about Trump coming to the rescue of U.S. Marines.Then CNN s Brian Stelter piled on by nailing Hannity for lying about Hillary Clinton, and Newsweek reporter Kurt Eichenwald slammed Hannity for claiming that Hillary suffers seizures.And now Hannity is getting shade from one of his own colleagues.During the post-debate analysis on Fox News, Kelly had to introduce Hannity s interview with Donald Trump. And as she introduced the interview, Kelly wondered if Trump would be talking to the actual journalists in the room afterward. We ve got Trump speaking to our own Sean Hannity. We ll see whether he speaks to the journalists in this room after that interview. Here s the video via YouTube.Trump and Hannity proceeded to trash Hillary Clinton, but it looks like the main focus will be on Kelly for basically telling a lying commentator like Hannity to go f*ck himself.And he definitely deserved the shade. After all, Hannity is not a real journalist. He ignores facts and peddles bullshit and frankly shouldn t be allowed anywhere near the airwaves. Hannity is Trump s puppet and he clearly cannot be fair and balanced as the network he works for advertises.Featured image via screen capture",News,"September 27, 2016"

This can clearly be seen with the excitement and electricity generated when Barack Obama ran for and then won the presidency. The world realizes the influence the United States exerts on the planet and thus looks very closely at our political developments, especially when it relates to presidential candidates.Thus, much of the world has been alarmed and scared by the rise of Donald Trump, a man who has promised to do all sorts of crazy thing once he becomes president. He won t rule out using nuclear weapons, he s repeatedly insulted and threatened Mexicans with his stupid wall, he wants to kick start an arms race, he wants to ban Muslims from entering the United States, Islamophobia would be state policy, and he wants to punish women who have abortions.As is stated in the video below: If Trump actually makes it to the White House, there s only one thing you can predict about this wholly unpredictable man: There will be a surge in what people will call anti-American-ism. People will mock the nation as dumb, vulgar, and aggressive. It will be like it was in the Geroge W. Bush years, only much much worse. We don t need another Bush, or someone who can actually be worse if that s even possible.

1815, New Trump Comments Confirm That Bannon Could Be On His Way OUT (DETAILS),"There have been weeks of reports that White House Chief Strategist Stephen K. Bannon and Senior Adviser and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner have been at each other s throats. Reportedly, the infighting is so bad that White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus had to moderate a meeting between the two so that they could call a truce. Now, new comments from Donald Trump suggest that he s not so hot on Bannon these days, and if it comes down to it in a knock down, drag out, Bannon v. Kushner fight, Kushner will definitely emerge the victor.Michael Goodwin of the New York Post asked Donald Trump if he was still confident in Bannon s abilities, and for the first time, Trump didn t give a full-throated defense of his white supremacist Chief Strategist. In fact, he seemed to want to downplay the level of Bannon s influence in both the campaign and the White House. Trump told Goodwin: I like Steve, but you have to remember he was not involved in my campaign until very late. I had already beaten all the senators and all the governors, and I didn t know Steve. I m my own strategist and it wasn t like I was going to change strategies because I was facing crooked Hillary. When White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer was asked about the Bannon v. Kushner feud, he tried to say that the media was making too much of it: There s a lot of stuff that was overblown about this that makes it out into the media sometimes and gets a little more sensational than it really is. Of course, this directly contradicts Trump s comments to the New York Post. In addition to the aforementioned statements, Trump also said: Steve is a good guy, but I told them to straighten it out or I will. So, in other words, it looks like Bannon is on the chopping block. Perhaps the rest of the white nationalist Pepe brigade will be ousted with him if and when he goes. It s a shame that we have sunk to the level in 2017 of hoping to get avowed white supremacists out of the White House, but here we are.

17415,"HILLARY CLINTON: We All Know She’s Deceitful And Dishonest, But I Bet You Didn’t Know This…"," She was an unethical, dishonest lawyer. She conspired to violate the Constitution, the rules of the House, the rules of the committee and the rules of confidentiality. I ve decided to reprint a piece of work I did nearly five years ago, because it seems very relevant today given Hillary Clinton s performance in the Benghazi hearings. Back in 2008 when she was running for president, I interviewed two erstwhile staff members of the House Judiciary Committee who were involved with the atergate investigation when Hillary was a low-level staffer there. I interviewed one Democrat staffer and one Republican staffer, and wrote two pieces based on what they told me about Hillary s conduct at the time.I published these pieces back in 2008 for North Star Writers Group, the syndicate I ran at the time. This was the most widely read piece we ever had at NSWG, but because NSWG never gained the high-profile status of the major syndicates, this piece still didn t reach as many people as I thought it deserved to. Today, given the much broader reach of CainTV and yet another incidence of Hillary s arrogance in dealing with a congressional committee, I think it deserves another airing. For the purposes of simplicity, I ve combined the two pieces into one very long one. If you re interested in understanding the true character of Hillary Clinton, it s worth your time to read it.As Hillary Clinton came under increasing scrutiny for her story about facing sniper fire in Bosnia, one question that arose was whether she has engaged in a pattern of lying.The now-retired general counsel and chief of staff of the House Judiciary Committee, who supervised Hillary when she worked on the Watergate investigation, says Hillary s history of lies and unethical behavior goes back farther   and goes much deeper   than anyone realizes.Jerry Zeifman, a lifelong Democrat, supervised the work of 27-year-old Hillary Rodham on the committee. Hillary got a job working on the investigation at the behest of her former law professor, Burke Marshall, who was also Sen. Ted Kennedy s chief counsel in the Chappaquiddick affair. When the investigation was over, Zeifman fired Hillary from the committee staff and refused to give her a letter of recommendation   one of only three people who earned that dubious distinction in Zeifman s 17-year career.Why? Because she was a liar,  Zeifman said in an interview last week.  She was an unethical, dishonest lawyer. She conspired to violate the Constitution, the rules of the House, the rules of the committee and the rules of confidentiality. How could a 27-year-old House staff member do all that? She couldn t do it by herself, but Zeifman said she was one of several individuals   including Marshall, special counsel John Doar and senior associate special counsel (and future Clinton White House Counsel) Bernard Nussbaum   who engaged in a seemingly implausible scheme to deny Richard Nixon the right to counsel during the investigatioWhy would they want to do that? Because, according to Zeifman, they feared putting Watergate break-in mastermind E. Howard Hunt on the stand to be cross-examined by counsel to the president. Hunt, Zeifman said, had the goods on nefarious activities in the Kennedy Administration that would have made Watergate look like a day at the beach   including Kennedy s purported complicity in the attempted assassination of Fidel Castro.The actions of Hillary and her cohorts went directly against the judgment of top Democrats, up to and including then-House Majority Leader Tip O Neill, that Nixon clearly had the right to counsel. Zeifman says that Hillary, along with Marshall, Nussbaum and Doar, was determined to gain enough votes on the Judiciary Committee to change House rules and deny counsel to Nixon. And in order to pull this off, Zeifman says Hillary wrote a fraudulent legal brief, and confiscated public documents to hide her deception.The brief involved precedent for representation by counsel during an impeachment proceeding. When Hillary endeavored to write a legal brief arguing there is no right to representation by counsel during an impeachment proceeding, Zeifman says, he told Hillary about the case of Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas, who faced an impeachment attempt in 1970. As soon as the impeachment resolutions were introduced by (then-House Minority Leader Gerald) Ford, and they were referred to the House Judiciary Committee, the first thing Douglas did was hire himself a lawyer,  Zeifman said.The Judiciary Committee allowed Douglas to keep counsel, thus establishing the precedent. Zeifman says he told Hillary that all the documents establishing this fact were in the Judiciary Committee s public files. So what did Hillary do? Hillary then removed all the Douglas files to the offices where she was located, which at that time was secured and inaccessible to the public,  Zeifman said. Hillary then proceeded to write a legal brief arguing there was no precedent for the right to representation by counsel during an impeachment proceeding   as if the Douglas case had never occurred.The brief was so fraudulent and ridiculous, Zeifman believes Hillary would have been disbarred if she had submitted it to a judge.Zeifman says that if Hillary, Marshall, Nussbaum and Doar had succeeded, members of the House Judiciary Committee would have also been denied the right to cross-examine witnesses, and denied the opportunity to even participate in the drafting of articles of impeachment against Nixon.Of course, Nixon s resignation rendered the entire issue moot, ending Hillary s career on the Judiciary Committee staff in a most undistinguished manner. Zeifman says he was urged by top committee members to keep a diary of everything that was happening. He did so, and still has the diary if anyone wants to check the veracity of his story. Certainly, he could not have known in 1974 that diary entries about a young lawyer named Hillary Rodham would be of interest to anyone 34 years later.But they show that the pattern of lies, deceit, fabrications and unethical behavior was established long ago   long before the Bosnia lie, and indeed, even before cattle futures, Travelgate and Whitewater   for the woman who is still asking us to make her president of the United States.Franklin Polk, who served at the time as chief Republican counsel on the committee, confirmed many of these details in two interviews he granted me this past Friday, although his analysis of events is not always identical to Zeifman s. Polk specifically confirmed that Hillary wrote the memo in question, and confirmed that Hillary ignored the Douglas case. (He said he couldn t confirm or dispel the part about Hillary taking the Douglas files.)To Polk, Hillary s memo was dishonest in the sense that she tried to pretend the Douglas precedent didn t exist. But unlike Zeifman, Polk considered the memo dishonest in a way that was more stupid than sinister. Hillary should have mentioned that (the Douglas case), and then tried to argue whether that was a change of policy or not instead of just ignoring it and taking the precedent out of the opinion,  Polk said.Polk recalled that the attempt to deny counsel to Nixon upset a great many members of the committee, including just about all the Republicans, but many Democrats as well. The argument sort of broke like a firestorm on the committee, and I remember Congressman Don Edwards was very upset,  Polk said.  He was the chairman of the subcommittee on constitutional rights. But in truth, the impeachment precedents are not clear. Let s put it this way. In the old days, from the beginning of the country through the 1800s and early 1900s, there were precedents that the target or accused did not have the right to counsel. That s why Polk believes Hillary s approach in writing the memorandum was foolish. He says she could have argued that the Douglas case was an isolated example, and that other historical precedents could apply.But Zeifman says the memo and removal of the Douglas files was only part the effort by Hillary, Doar, Nussbaum and Marshall to pursue their own agenda during the investigation.After my first column, some readers wrote in claiming Zeifman was motivated by jealousy because he was not appointed as the chief counsel in the investigation, with that title going to Doar instead.Zeifman s account is that he supported the appointment of Doar because he, Zeifman, a) did not want the public notoriety that would come with such a high-profile role; and b) didn t have much prosecutorial experience. When he started to have a problem with Doar and his allies was when Zeifman and others, including House Majority Leader Tip O Neill and Democratic committee member Jack Brooks of Texas, began to perceive Doar s group as acting outside the directives and knowledge of the committee and its chairman, Peter Rodino.(O Neill died in 1994. Brooks is still living and I tried unsuccessfully to reach him. I d still like to.)This culminated in a project to research past presidential abuses of power, which committee members felt was crucial in aiding the decisions they would make in deciding how to handle Nixon s alleged offenses.According to Zeifman and other documents, Doar directed Hillary to work with a group of Yale law professors on this project. But the report they generated was never given to the committee. Zeifman believes the reason was that the report was little more than a whitewash of the Kennedy years   a part of the Burke Marshall-led agenda of avoiding revelations during the Watergate investigation that would have embarrassed the Kennedys.The fact that the report was kept under wraps upset Republican committee member Charles Wiggins of California, who wrote a memo to his colleagues on the committee that read in part:Within the past few days, some disturbing information has come to my attention. It is requested that the facts concerning the matter be investigated and a report be made to the full committee as it concerns us all.Early last spring when it became obvious that the committee was considering presidential  abuse of power  as a possible ground of impeachment, I raised the question before the full committee that research should be undertaken so as to furnish a standard against which to test the alleged abusive conduct of Richard Nixon.As I recall, several other members joined with me in this request. I recall as well repeating this request from time to time during the course of our investigation. The staff, as I recall, was noncommittal, but it is certain that no such staff study was made available to the members at any time for their use.Wiggins believed the report was purposely hidden from committee members. Chairman Rodino denied this, and said the reason Hillary s report was not given to committee members was that it contained no value. It s worth noting, of course, that the staff member who made this judgment was John Doar.In a four-page reply to Wiggins, Rodino wrote in part:Hillary Rodham of the impeachment inquiry staff coordinated the work. . . . After the staff received the report it was reviewed by Ms. Rodham, briefly by Mr. Labovitz and Mr. Sack, and by Doar. The staff did not think the manuscript was useful in its present form. . . .In your letter you suggest that members of the staff may have intentionally suppressed the report during the course of its investigation. That was not the case.As a matter of fact, Mr. Doar was more concerned that any highlight of the project might prejudice the case against President Nixon. The fact is that the staff did not think the material was usable by the committee in its existing form and had not had time to modify it so it would have practical utility for the members of the committee. I was informed and agreed with the judgment.Mr. Labovitz, by the way, was John Labovitz, another member of the Democratic staff. I spoke with Labovitz this past Friday as well, and he is no fan of Jerry Zeifman. If it s according to Zeifman, it s inaccurate from my perspective,  Labovitz said. He bases that statement on a recollection that Zeifman did not actually work on the impeachment inquiry staff, although that is contradicted not only by Zeifman but Polk as well.Labovitz said he has no knowledge of Hillary having taken any files, and defended her no-right-to-counsel memo on the grounds that, if she was assigned to write a memo arguing a point of view, she was merely following orders.But as both Zeifman and Polk point out, that doesn t mean ignoring background of which you are aware, or worse, as Zeifman alleges, confiscating documents that disprove your argument.All told, Polk recalls the actions of Hillary, Doar and Nussbaum as more amateurish than anything else. Of course the Republicans went nuts,  Polk said.  But so did some of the Democrats   some of the most liberal Democrats. It was more like these guys   Doar and company   were trying to manage the members of Congress, and it was like,  Who s in charge here?  If you want to convict a president, you want to give him all the rights possible. If you re going to give him a trial, for him to say,  My rights were denied,    it was a stupid effort by people who were just politically tone deaf. So this was a big deal to people in the proceedings on the committee, no question about it. And Jerry Zeifman went nuts, and rightfully so. But my reaction wasn t so much that it was underhanded as it was just stupid. Polk recalls Zeifman sharing with him at the time that he believed Hillary s primary role was to report back to Burke Marshall any time the investigation was taking a turn that was not to the liking of the Kennedys. Jerry used to give the chapter and verse as to how Hillary was the mole into the committee works as to how things were going,  Polk said.  And she d be feeding information back to Burke Marshall, who, at least according to Jerry, was talking to the Kennedys. And when something was off track in the view of the Kennedys, Burke Marshall would call John Doar or something, and there would be a reconsideration of what they were talking about. Jerry used to tell me that this was Hillary s primary function. Zeifman says he had another staff member get him Hillary s phone records, which showed that she was calling Burke Marshall at least once a day, and often several times a day.A final note about all this: I wrote my first column on this subject because, in the aftermath of Hillary being caught in her Bosnia fib, I came in contact with Jerry Zeifman and found his story compelling. Zeifman has been trying to tell his story for many years, and the mainstream media have ignored him. I thought it deserved an airing as a demonstration of how early in her career Hillary began engaging in self-serving, disingenuous conduct.Disingenuously arguing a position? Vanishing documents? Selling out members of her own party to advance a personal agenda? Classic Hillary. Neither my first column on the subject nor this one were designed to show that Hillary is dishonest. I don t really think that s in dispute. Rather, they were designed to show that she has been this way for a very long time   a fact worth considering for anyone contemplating voting for her for president of the United States.By the way, there s something else that started a long time ago. She would go around saying,  I m dating a person who will some day be president,  Polk said.  It was like a Babe Ruth call. And because of that comment she made, I watched Bill Clinton s political efforts as governor of Arkansas, and I never counted him out because she had made that forecast. Bill knew what he wanted a long time ago. Clearly, so did Hillary, and her tactics for trying to achieve it were established even in those early days.Vote wisely.Via: Patriot Net Daily",Government News,"Apr 15, 2015"

4838, Fmr. Mexican President: Trump Is Not Welcome In Our Country (VIDEO),"Donald Trump has decided to make his way down to Mexico on Wednesday for a meeting with President Enrique Pena Nieto. For obvious reasons, this is a visit that is not being well received by the Mexican people. Trump s long history of insulting Mexico, its people, and Mexican immigrants in America has their community incensed at his nerve to show his face in Mexico City. Therefore, former Mexican President Vicente Fox has decided to weigh in on the situation.Appearing on CNN, Fox said: I m sure he s going to be rejected by everybody here in Mexico. We cannot accept this going on. And yes, it could be a desperate move.   To me, it is a desperate move on both sides. Fox went on to say that Trump  is not welcome to Mexico,  and continued: We don t like him. We don t want him. Fox also criticized current President Pena Nieto for entertaining Trump s visit: I think President Pena is taking an enormous political risk by hosting Trump,  going on to call Pena Nieto s decision a  big mistake.  Fox also straight   out apologized for the visit and the president s insistence on going along with it: I really apologize for our president taking this step forward. After that, Fox turned his attentions to Trump himself, and his many hypocrisies regarding the issues of immigration and trade: How can you believe him when we are hearing right now that he and his wife violated migration laws in the United States?How can he speak about trade war when he s manufacturing all his products for his business outside of the United States? It s absolutely incongruent, absolutely inconsistent. Fox then appealed directly to Americans, warning us of Trump s incompetence when it comes to being president: I just cannot envision him sitting on that chair that was the chair of President Washington, President Jefferson, President Kennedy, President Reagan   all the great presidents that nation has had.This guy is not up to be a president. Of course, Trump, unwilling to let any criticism go, actually tried to lie regarding a proposed visit with Vicente Fox. He lashed out at Fox on Twitter:Former President Vicente Fox, who is railing against my visit to Mexico today, also invited me when he apologized for using the ""f bomb.""  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 31, 2016Fox fired back, though, setting the record straight:@realDonaldTrump, I invited you to come and apologize to all Mexicans. Stop lying! Mexico is not yours to play with, show some respect.  Vicente Fox Quesada (@VicenteFoxQue) August 31, 2016Fox is likely right. The Mexican people  have every reason to loathe Donald Trump. Trump, in all his arrogance, likely thinks that this visit with President Pena Nieto will mean concessions   and, dare I say it   a check for his border wall. None of that will happen, though, and hopefully Trump returns from Mexico humiliated, as he so richly deserves.Watch video of Fox s comments below:Featured image via Patrick T.

2022, WATCH: Rachel Maddow Laughs At Republican Effort To Pass Universally Hated Trumpcare Bill,"House Republicans failed to pass their disastrous healthcare bill on Thursday and Rachel Maddow hilariously mocked them for it.Due to the deep unpopularity of the legislation, Republican leadership decided to cancel the vote on the bill at the last minute rather than see it get humiliatingly defeated.Many Republicans are leaning against the bill because it fails to lower premiums and would strip healthcare away from over 20 million Americans, many of whom are conservatives who rely on the Affordable Care Act, which actually does keep premiums lower and covers more people.Under the Trumpcare bill, senior citizens would have to pay nearly ten times as much money on healthcare than what they currently pay under the Affordable Care Act. And since senior citizens are a major voting block for the GOP for some reason, Republicans are backing away from the bill.Of course, Republicans have been rehearsing the repeal of the Affordable Care Act for years, holding over 60 separate votes in the House over the years just to make their conservative base happy. But now that more people understand what the Affordable Care Act actually has done, they are fiercely opposing any repeal effort.Rachel Maddow noted the angry crowds of constituents at Republican town halls and pointed out with a laugh that the GOP bill is more unpopular than despised New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. In the universe, including our weird politics. A day after the election, nobody would have told you that Republicans would have any trouble repealing Obamacare. That s what they could do on their own, they d push on an open door. The Affordable Care Act, they d been rehearsing repealing it for years. It would definitely be their first casualty, no problem. Then they d get on to the hard stuff. But people all over the country in every congressional district in the country changed the course of that otherwise inevitable history.The Republican plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act has a 17 percent approval rating. That s worse than Chris Christie. There is not a single Congressional district in this country where the number of people who like the Republican idea out-number the people who strongly hate the Republican idea. Not in a single Congressional district. That happens for a reason. That political climate doesn t exist in nature, it is created by people engaged in political action. Maddow concluded the 2-minute segment by reminding everyone that Republicans failed to pass their bill despite having majority control of the House and said it s all thanks to people who have added their voices to the chorus of those opposed to killing a law that actually helps people. For the people who have been trying to save the Affordable Care Act all over the country, even what just happened tonight is huge,  Maddow said.  Everybody thought Republicans would be able to move at will on this but people said nope. Here s the video via YouTube:Donald Trump s healthcare plan would literally kill people in this country and that s not right. It s inhumane. It forces people to choose between getting medical care or not going bankrupt and that s morally wrong. Healthcare is a human right and it s a need that no one should be priced out of having.If Republicans somehow ram this legislation down our throats they should be brutally punished for it. Because any lawmaker who supports something that kills people is not someone who should be in public office.Featured image via screenshot",News,"March 24, 2017"

14826,BUILD THE WALL! How Terrorists Have Been Coming Across Our Border For Years [Video],"OUR GOOD FRIENDS AT TEXAS BORDER VOLUNTEERS are on the border catching illegals all the time. The Vickers family has a ranch that sees hundreds of illegals. Please read the first-hand account of what s really been going on at our border: MIKE VICKERS OF TEXAS BORDER VOLUNTEERS:  Probably 60 percent to 70 percent of the groups we encounter are not Mexican,  said Dr. Mike Vickers, who started the group and who owns a ranch in South Texas.  We see a lot of Chinese and people from India and Pakistan.  All day, every day, thousands of people cross by car, by bus and on foot   spilling out onto the main streets of Laredo. As she makes a Christmas wreath, flower shop owner Marta Narvaez says she s scared. Narvaez tells us in Spanish she feels sorry for Syrians fleeing war in their homeland. But it s also dangerous, she says, because we don t know if some refugees are also terrorists. We try to piece the story together,  Webb County Medical Examiner Dr. Corinne Stern says. When someone dies on the journey north, she interviews the people who stayed with the body. We asked Dr. Stern how people from around the world are getting to Laredo.  It s the same story. It s the same story every time,  she says.  They ll say we crossed the river at night. It s always at night.  Always with the help of smugglers who run routes through Central America and Mexico   and it s big business.  We ask how much did you pay the coyote,  Dr. Stern says.  The average I hear is $8,000 to $12,000. And somehow they come up with that money.  So far this year, her team has not found the body of anyone of Syrian descent.  But we know it s happening. We know they re trying to cross our border,  Dr. Stern says.Now many lawmakers are calling for tougher border security laws.  I think the concern with Syria is: are these folks connected to ISIS?  Rep. Will Hurd (R   TX) says. His district includes almost all of Texas  long border with Mexico.  I spent 9 years as an undercover officer in the CIA,  Rep. Hurd says.  I was chasing Al Qaeda in Pakistan and Afghanistan. I ve been on some pretty nasty borders in my career so I know something about stopping bad guys.  He calls the terrorist attacks against the French and Russians warnings, and now America must decide how to handle Syrians at our border before it s too late.  The House passed legislation and the Senate s picking up saying if we re not able to figure out who these people are, we shouldn t let them in the country,  Rep. Hurd says.  It s balancing compassion with security.  If border towns are the first line of defense, checkpoints are the last. They re about an hour or so north, in rural areas that are always on high alert. We encounter people from different nationalities,  Hector Moreno with the U.S. Border Patrol says. Agents at the checkpoint in Falfurrias are known for busting the most undocumented workers and drug runners. But for every person they catch, dozens more trek through the thick South Texas brush to avoid detection. So Border Patrol has added a new tool to its arsenal: rescue beacons, strategically placed on vast ranches that are hotbeds of smuggling activity. The beacons are tall, red towers. At the base is a button people can push if they need emergency or medical help and want to turn themselves in to Border Patrol.  It comes in Spanish and in Mandarin.At one time there was an influx of that nationality in these parts of the area,  Moreno says. The beacons are more evidence of the worldwide web of immigration. But ranchers in the Rio Grande Valley says when it comes to this latest threat from Syrians, the government isn t coming clean.  The Border Patrol do not tell us as ranchers what specific countries these special interest countries   these people come from,  rancher Dr. Mike Vickers says.  And we have a problem with that. Why is Washington keeping it a big secret? Using their pack of dogs as protection, Dr. Vickers and his wife Linda encounter immigrants undeterred by electric fences and barbed wire. They ve personally caught hundreds of people trying to skirt the checkpoint.  Whether they re an illegal alien from Mexico or from Syria it is my duty to find them on my property and report them to Border Patrol. No exceptions,  Linda Vickers says. One time, something was left behind that Dr. Vickers says proves people from the Middle East have been crossing the border illegally for years now.  As he came over the fence, this fell out of his pocket,  Dr. Vickers says while holding up a dusty book.  And we were right there watching the whole show.  It s an Urdu dictionary found two years ago.  This is where Urdu is spoken,  Dr. Vickers says while pointing at a map inside the book.  Pakistan, Afghanistan, India, Iran.  Flip through the dictionary and you ll find key phrases are circled.  You must pay in dollars,  Dr. Vickers reads.  All of these phrases were circled so this is obviously a dictionary the coyote was using to communicate with the people.  The old discovery is giving way to new concerns as Syrian refugees make their way west.  Mexico s taking them but they re not going to stay in Mexico,  Linda Vickers says.  They re going to head up here. I think that s a given. Read more: News 4 San Antonio",politics,"Dec 8, 2015"

2175, Meet The Woman Running Against White Supremacist Steve King In Iowa – This Is How To Help Her Win,"If you haven t heard about Rep. Steve King s (R-IA) white supremacy tweet by now, you re really not paying attention. While citing a Twitter account called  Voice of Europe  that demonized the religion of Islam, King tweeted: Wilders understands that culture and demographics are our destiny. We can t restore our civilization with somebody else s babies. Wilders understands that culture and demographics are our destiny. We can't restore our civilization with somebody else's babies. https://t.co/4nxLipafWO  Steve King (@SteveKingIA) March 12, 2017Basically saying, in so many words, the only babies needed are white babies. A classic white supremacist trope that is code for a form of ethnic cleansing.It s outrageous that King has won time and time again in the 4th Congressional District in Iowa, even winning again this past November for an eighth time. It seems pretty revealing of the voting populace of that district.However, there is one woman who is steadfast in defeating King and bringing sanity and decency back to the 4th Congressional District in Iowa. That woman is Kim Weaver. And even though King defeated her in 2016, she never stopped fighting, and is continuing her mission to defeat him in the 2018 midterms.There is only one way she ll win, though, and that is with the help of not only those within her district, but from nationwide support. After all, Congressional races affect the entirety of the United States because each representative is a vote in Congress which helps determines policy for the entire nation.Working day and night to replace Steve King in Iowa's 4th Congressional District. All help is greatly appreciated! https://t.co/i0cM36lvlg  Kim Weaver (@KimWeaverIA) September 14, 2016And don t just support Weaver because she s battling Steve King. Support her because she s a great candidate. According to The Des Moines Register: Weaver works as an advocate for seniors in nursing homes, assisted living and residential care facilities with the Office of the State Long-term Care Ombudsman. She also has been a Medicaid case manager and a care provider for adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities. So her emphasis on issues for seniors comes from working with people who struggle to pay for long-term care or can t find assistance to stay in their homes.She s also a single mother of three young adults: a son with an aerospace engineering degree from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a daughter in medical school at University of Iowa and a son majoring in geology at Iowa State. So her concern about burdening the next generation under a mountain of college debt comes from worrying about her own children. Further: One of Weaver s more creative ideas is an attempt to simultaneously address two problems: college affordability and care for seniors. She advocates creating a national volunteer program to allow high school students to earn financial credit toward future tuition. She s hoping that some of those volunteer hours might be involved with helping seniors with cleaning, yard work and other chores so they can stay in their homes. Everyone seems to be treating Weaver like she doesn t stand a chance, but we have the chance to help her prove everyone wrong.You can help Weaver by going HERE, and then making sure everyone else does, too. In addition, you can spread the word on social media. The good thing about Congressional races is that they happen every two years. No one is safe from being ousted. No election is a sure thing. Let s make sure white supremacist Rep. Steve King knows that he has something to worry about in Kim Weaver.Featured Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images   Iowa Public Television",News,"March 12, 2017"
17311,REPORT: USDA GIVES $6.9 BILLION TO “INELIGIBLE RECIPIENTS” AKA NON-CITIZENS,"Your tax dollars up in smoke thanks to the USDA. The two culprits are food stamps and the school lunch program. We cannot afford to feed the entire world or the millions of illegals crossing our border. The U.S. spent a record $80.4 billion on giving free groceries to Americans but also to non-citizens. The bloated federal agency charged with feeding the poor and eradiating  food insecurity  in the U.S. blew nearly $7 billion to provide  ineligible recipients  with the welfare benefit and there appears to be no end in sight to the fleecing.In fact, the agency, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), has for years violated a measure known as the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act (IPERA) that requires agencies to conduct annual risk assessments to identify programs that make  significant improper payments  of $10 million or more. Not only has the USDA violated IPERA in the last four years, it also refuses to implement a more efficient verification process before doling out benefits by asserting that it would  create barriers for families that need help. Last year the USDA made an astounding $6.9 billion of  improper payments,  according to a scathing report made public this week by the agency s inspector general. Two programs accounted for a chunk of the money that was wasted; food stamps, officially known as Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) to eliminate the stigma of welfare and the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) which cost American taxpayers a whopping $16 billion in 2014. Of the $6.9 billion in fraudulent payments made by the USDA, those two programs accounted for $4.2 billion. Thus, they have been coined  high-risk programs,  according to the USDA watchdog.The overwhelming majority of improper payments go to provide ineligible recipients with goods or services, the report confirms. This is par for the course at the USDA and the agency seems to have no intention of cleaning up its rolls. In fact, the agency goes out of its way to cover up wrongdoing in four of its most fraud-infested programs.  USDA is noncompliant with the improper payment requirements for a fourth consecutive year,  the report says. Not coincidentally, a separate probe conducted by the investigative arm of Congress, also found that the USDA needs to improve its verification process for program access. That report, also made public this week, focuses only on the National School Lunch Program, which is notorious for wasting millions of taxpayer dollars.Also this week, Congress held a special hearing to address waste, fraud and abuse in child nutrition programs operated by the USDA. At the hearing, held by the House Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary and Secondary Education, witnesses identified misused taxpayer dollars in three of the nation s largest child nutrition programs, which include school lunch and breakfast. The Forensic Audits and Investigative Service director at the Government Accountability Office (GAO) testified that both programs have been designated as  high-error  by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). In fact, nearly half of the households that received benefits were not eligible because their income exceeded eligibility guidelines, according to the director Jessica Lucas-Judy.Judicial Watch has reported extensively on the pervasive fraud and corruption in the government s various food assistance programs, especially food stamps, which has grown immensely under President Obama. Last year JW reported that the government spent a mind-boggling $80.4 billion to give a record number of people many who didn t even qualify for the welfare benefit free groceries. A few years ago JW uncovered documents that show illegal immigrants also receive food stamps from Uncle Sam under an outrageous initiative with the Mexican government to promote participation by undocumented aliens.Via: Judicial Watch",Government News,"May 27, 2015"
13967,WATCH 8TH Grader DESTROY Disgraced Detroit City Council Member And Wife Of US Representative In Debate [VIDEO],"Watching this video will help anyone who is curious about why the city of Detroit continues to be bailed out of trouble like an irresponsible child with a trust fund. This video of Detroit City Council member Monica Conyers (D), wife of US Representative John Conyers helps to explain the type of character Detroit voters have been placing their trust in for decades. This is an older video, but definitely worth sharing.Shortly after this debate with an 8th grader, City Councilwoman Monica Conyers was found guilty of bribery and sent to prison for 3 years.Former Detroit City councilwoman, Monica Conyers was sentenced to more than three years in prison for bribery after a federal judge refused to set aside her guilty plea during a stormy court hearing dominated by a dispute over evidence of other payoffs.As guards cleared the packed courtroom, Monica Conyers yelled that she planned to appeal. The wife of U.S. Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., wanted to withdraw her guilty plea, suggesting she was the victim of  badgering  last year when she admitted taking cash to support a Houston company s sludge contract with the city.But U.S. District Judge Avern Cohn, reviewing a transcript of the June hearing, said Conyers had denied any coercion and voluntarily pleaded guilty to conspiracy.Conyers, 45, is the biggest catch so far in the FBI s wide-ranging investigation of corruption in Detroit city government. Nine people have pleaded guilty, including two former directors of the downtown convention center, and prosecutors have promised more charges are coming. Bribery is a betrayal of trust,  Cohn told Conyers after announcing a 37-month prison term for her  egregious  crime. She quit the council after pleading guilty in June.Conyers  plea deal was limited to taking bribes to support a contract with Synagro worth $47 million a year. But the recent trial of her former aide, Sam Riddle, exposed a series of alleged schemes involving others making payoffs to do business at city hall.Prosecutors said Riddle and Conyers collected $69,500 by shaking people down and urged Cohn to consider the alleged crimes when sentencing her. Defense lawyer Steve Fishman firmly objected and demanded a separate hearing.Conyers declared,  I m not going to jail for something I didn t do. Before the hearing, Conyers moved around the courtroom like a playful host, blowing kisses to supporters while wearing dark sunglasses. Her husband, who has an office in the federal courthouse, was not in the courtroom. Spokesman Jonathan Godfrey said he didn t know his whereabouts. Via: Huff PostDespite her going to prison, losing her political job and often embarrassing the family with her behavior in City Hall, U.S. Rep. John Conyers does not want a divorce from his feisty wife, Monica Conyers, his lawyer told the Free Press on Monday.The former Detroit city councilwoman filed for divorce last month, claiming the marriage has fallen apart beyond repair. But her 86-year-old husband wants to work things out.  Detroit Free Press",politics,"May 6, 2016"

18029,LOL! SHAKEDOWN ARTIST JESSE JACKSON TELLS CROWD: “President Trump Would Not Qualify To Get Into Jesus’ Kingdom” [VIDEO],"Here s a 1999 video of Jesse Jackson praising Donald Trump for his contribution to the black community, awarding him with a lifetime achievement award for African Americans:What a difference a few years (and an [R] behind your name can make:WFB   While speaking to a crowd at the  Ministers March for Justice  Rev. Jesse Jackson suggested that President Trump should be worried about gaining citizenship in heaven. Trump says you must be able to speak the language of English, [be] qualified, and have a job skill,  Jackson said Monday.  Jesus would not qualify to come in Trump s country he would not qualify to get into Jesus  kingdom. It s difficult to understand Jackson in the video below, as he mumbles through much of his commentary. (For translation, see quotes above):The  Ministers March for Justice,  was spearheaded by Rev. Al Sharpton and featured ministers from various traditions united in opposing the Trump administration. The event took place on the 54th anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr. s March on Washington, and Jackson did not shy away from using religious language to judge the president.After judging Trump s ability to enter heaven, he quoted part of a passage from the Gospel of Matthew, in which Jesus says what he will tell his followers at the Final Judgment.Is the notorious shake down artist Jesse Jackson really one to be deciding who will and who will not be given admittance to heaven? In 2006, government watchdog Judicial Watch released a report that revealed new details about the intimidation and shakedown tactics of Jesse Jackson s Rainbow Push Coalition.WND   The report,  Jesse Jackson Exposed,  claims Jackson is  an extortionist who uses his influence as a civil rights leader to essentially blackmail wealthy corporations with absurd discrimination threats. Included, the group says, are  incriminating admissions from Jackson made under oath at trial. Among the tactics highlighted in the report are:Jackson lobbied the Federal Communications Commission to block companies seeking government approval to merge until they donate money to Rainbow Push.Jackson publicly chastised Toyota for running an ad Jackson deemed  racist.  After Toyota pulled the ad, Jackson threatened a boycott the automaker to force it to launch a $7.8 million  diversity program. Jackson installed one of his friends, J.L. Armstrong, in a management position at Toyota to determine which organizations would receive $700 million in contracts awarded by Toyota.Minority businesses pay Jackson s  Trade Bureau  a fee to help extort lucrative contracts from corporations. During the trial, Jackson compared the Trade Bureau to  Noah s Ark,  claiming minority businesses and organizations had to be inside the  ark  to survive. Judicial Watch brought the lawsuit against Jackson, his son Jonathan Jackson and Rainbow Push Coalition on behalf of Rev. Jesse Lee Peterson, a black minister and founder of the Los Angeles-based Brotherhood Organization for a New Destiny.Peterson wrote a book titled,  Scam,  that takes Jackson to task as one of America s  self-appointed  black leaders. I don t recall the entire black race in this country taking a national vote to elect Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton, Louis Farrakhan, the NAACP, California Congresswoman Maxine Waters, the Congressional Black Caucus or liberal black preachers as our leaders,  Peterson writes,  yet they ve seized the mantle of leadership and claim to speak for all blacks in this nation. Another expose of Jackson, Kenneth Timmerman s book  Shakedown: Exposing the real Jesse Jackson,  goes back several decades, including his ordination as a reverend. I describe a two to three year process for earning that title,  Timmerman said.  Jesse Jackson got himself ordained two months after Martin Luther King was shot. It was essentially a  political ordination,  a  shotgun ordination.  He did not go through the long procedure. He was not licensed to preach, as far as I could determine. I went to the church where he was ordained. He did not go through this two-year process. He never submitted himself to the authority of the church. He has never had a church himself, and he has been accountable to no one.  Timmerman asserts Jackson  is not doing things to help the black community. Jesse Jackson is   to help himself first.

10752,HILLARY APPEARS Wearing “Anti-Seizure” Sunglasses (Again) In Memorial Day Parade,"Remember when experts came out after Hillary collapsed following her visit to the 9-11 memorial in NYC and revealed that the odd blue-colored sunglasses Hillary was sporting that day are used by epileptic patients to avoid having a seizure.Who could forget Hillary s bizarre collapse that day, when her legs began to buckle and secret service agents grabbed her arms and threw her into the vehicle. It was almost as though the people around Hillary were well practiced in how to toss her into the vehicle before the cameras could catch her having a seizure only months before the election.Watch: Infowars   Hillary was seen wearing the blue sunglasses during the 9/11 memorial in New York City where she later collapsed from complications stemming from her numerous health issues.Given her lack of fashion concerns   she s regularly seen wearing pantsuits everywhere she goes   it s unlikely her blue sunglasses were meant as a fashion statement.Epileptic patients often wear Zeiss Z1 blue lenses in particular because they are effective at treating photosensitive epilepsy. The Z1 lens is highly effective in controlling photoparoxysmal response in a very large number of photosensitive epilepsy patients irrespective of their epilepsy or antiepileptic drug treatment,  according to a 2006 studypublished in Epilepsia.  The lens might become a valid resource in the daily activity of any clinician who cares for patients with epilepsy. Hillary experiences seizures from flashing lights, such as camera flashes at public events, according to sources inside the Secret Service who spoke to Infowars.Hillary Clinton appeared in Chappaqua, NY in their Memorial Day parade as a float with her husband Bill, the former president and rapist.

5704, Huckabee FURIOUS After He’s Forced To Pay $25k For Playing ‘Eye Of The Tiger’ At Kim Davis Rally,"When Kim Davis made her way  back on the street  after doing her time and taking her chances, then-presidential candidate Mike Huckabee triumphantly played Survivor s  Eye of the Tiger  to welcome the bigoted Kentucky county clerk back to the civilization whose laws she refused to respect. Davis was jailed briefly after refusing to issue marriage licenses to gay couples in violation of the Supreme Court s ruling that same-sex marriage is legal nationwide   something that angered the band s frontman, Frankie Sullivan. NO! We did not grant Kim Davis any rights to use  My Tune -The Eye Of The Tiger.  I would not grant her the rights to use Charmin!  a furious Sullivan wrote on Twitter following Davis and Huckabee s stunt.  See Ya really SoooooooonnnnnN!!! The Rude Music, which is owned by Sullivan, quickly sued Huckabee for copyright infringement, leading Huckabee s campaign to boldly declare they would not be  bullied  by artists whose only desire is to protect the integrity of their work. Mr. Sullivan is demanding an amount of money that exceeds the average yearly salary of a hard-working American simply because a snippet of his song was played briefly at a rally,  Huckabee spokeswoman Alice Stewart told CNN at the time.  The campaign offered Mr. Sullivan fair compensation, but that offer was rejected. We refuse to be bullied. The campaign argued that the event was a  religious assembly  and that it didn t have to pay because the hate rally was  non-commercial    a strange assertion given that Huckabee s political campaign paid for everything. Ultimately, Huckabee s legal defense performed a perfect imitation of his presidential campaign. He ultimately settled for a confidential amount   but the former Fox News contributor s campaign disclosure forms reveal that he made two payments of $12,500 to Rude Music. The first was listed as a  legal settlement  for  copyright infringement. The second was listed under  debts and obligations. Since Huckabee s campaign was perpetually broke, the 2016 washout petitioned the FEC to allow him to set up a special legal defense fund, but the FEC told him to bootstrap it up and pay the money himself.Featured image via Getty Images/Ty Wright",News,"June 27, 2016"

2044, Trump’s ‘Grab Them By The P***y’ Nature Reappeared During Meeting With Japanese Prime Minister,"Trump s disgusting brand of misogyny was laid bare for all to see during the election cycle and it should have sunk him, because he literally bragged about sexually assaulting women by kissing them without waiting, and also saying women would let him  grab them by the pussy,  because he was famous. If you thought that his being elected would have toned that down, you thought wrong. And he doesn t seem to care who s around when he gets lewd and disgusting like that.Last month, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe met with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. These kinds of meetings often require translators, and in this case, the translator was a woman. And Trump couldn t stop thinking about her. From Vanity Fair: [V]intage Trump is not going anywhere anytime soon. A couple of weeks earlier, during a visit by the Japanese prime minister, Shinz  Abe, the president told an acquaintance that he was obsessed with the translator s breasts although he expressed this in his own, fragrant fashion. Seriously, he said, practically right in front of another world leader, that he was obsessed with a woman s breasts. Was his mind even on the meeting or was he just staring at her breasts the whole time?Those comments, which Trump and his loyal subjects dismissed as mere locker room talk, led to men assaulting women on subways and sidewalks, literally yelling,  Grab her by the pussy!  Trump normalized objectifying and assaulting women because hey, if he can do it, then why can t everyone?And he s still at it! Now the question is, how often does this happen while he s meeting with diplomats and world leaders? What about the foreign press? Does he do this all the time, and nobody says anything? He s not just a joke, he s a vile, disgusting pig of a joke.Featured image by Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images",News,"March 22, 2017"

(The White House denied any symbolic unbuttoning, though officials confirmed Mr. Miller s fondness for the T-shirt.)He jumped, uninvited, into the final stretch of a girls  track meet, apparently intent on proving his athletic supremacy over the opposite sex. (The White House, reaching for exculpatory context, noted that this was a girls  team from another school, not his own.)Miller apparently hoped to take advantage of this  head start  to show that he is genetically superior to women by crossing the finish line first (this, of course, perfectly matches his current professed views on women).Donald Trump hires only the best people.Featured image via screengrab",News,"October 11, 2017"

3263," Noam Chomsky Makes ONE Last Request Of Obama, Trump Is PISSED (VIDEO)","As many of us are slowly (and sadly) coming to terms with the fact that President Barack Obama has almost completed his final term in the White House, some are making final requests of America s much-loved President.One of the people who still think Obama can save America from Trump is retired MIT linguistics professor Noam Chomsky, who recently posted a plea to Obama to save undocumented immigrants from the incoming Trump administration. In a video message, Chomsky said: President Obama, to his credit, has issued personal pardons in deserving cases, but he should go far beyond. Chomsky was referring to Obama s actions on December 19th, when he pardoned 78 people and gave 153 prisoners shorter sentences   all of which were non-violent, low-level drug offenders. During his presidency, Obama has pardoned a staggering 1,000 individuals   but Chomsky urged the Commander in Chief to go further due to the looming threat of Trump. Chomsky said: He should proceed to what is, in fact, an urgent necessity, to grant a general pardon to 11 million people who are living and working [in America], productive citizens  threatened with deportation by the incoming administration. If Obama pardoned all those people, Trump s promise to deport 2-3 million undocumented immigrants would go out the window. And despite Trump s flip-flopping on his immigration policies, Chomsky isn t banking on the President-elect being sympathetic or understanding in the long run. Bashing Trump s mass deportation scheme, Chomsky continued: This would be a horrible humanitarian tragedy. And moral outrage can be averted by a general pardon for immigration infractions which the President could issue. Peter L. Markowitz, a professor at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law, has confirmed that this is actually possible. A few months ago, Markowitz stated: President Obama can still act to bring humanity and justice to an immigration system notoriously lacking in both. He can do so by using the power the Constitution grants him   and only him   to pardon individuals for  offenses against the United States.' It s a common assumption that pardons can be used only for criminal offenses, and it s true that they have not been used before for civil immigration violations. However, the Constitution extends the power to all  offenses against the United States,  which can be interpreted more broadly than just criminal offenses. Chomsky said he hoped that Obama would listen to his plea and protect those who were vulnerable and in danger of Trump s divisive rhetoric, and urged his viewers to join him. Chomsky begged: We should join to urge [President Obama] to carry out this necessary step without delay. You can listen to Chomsky make his plea on behalf of undocumented immigrants below:If Obama does this Trump can kiss all of his anti-immigration promises goodbye and will have to suffer the wrath of his racist supporters.Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images",News,"December 27, 2016"
4376, Sarah Palin Just Tried (And Failed) To Attack Obama And Got Ripped Apart By The Internet (SCREENSHOTS),"When will Sarah Palin learn that the best response when someone says something not-so-nice about her is to shut up?Recently, President Obama pointed out that he sees a  straight line  between the disaster that was the vice presidential nomination of the half-wit, half-term former Governor of Alaska as being the incredibly stupid straw that broke the very unfortunate camel s back when it comes to right-wing politics, the figure who helped give power to the Tea Party, the Freedom Caucus, and other far-right groups whose members very likely know how to put out a meth lab explosion and still make the baby s room look OK by the next day   all without getting soot on their robes and hoods, no less! I see a straight line from the announcement of Sarah Palin as the vice-presidential nominee to what we see today in Donald Trump, the emergence of the Freedom Caucus, the tea party, and the shift in the center of gravity for the Republican Party,  the president told New York Magazine.  Whether that changes, I think, will depend in part on the outcome of this election, but it s also going to depend on the degree of self-reflection inside the Republican Party. There have been at least a couple of other times that I ve said confidently that the fever is going to have to break, but it just seems to get worse. Sarah Palin may not be smart   but even she can see an insult from her back porch. And, of course, Mama Grizzly wasn t about to take that lying down. On Monday, she posted a scathing reply to Obama   one that surely burned his black soul (that s black as in the color, not black in the way she would point it out) to its very core. There s a reason pro-American activists have been living rent free in President Obama s head these past eight years,  Palin wrote, adding the usual rhetoric about the national debt,  destroying our children s future,  etc.  THAT S what should occupy the President s headspace, not some hockey mom from Alaska. She linked to a fluff piece from Independent Journal Review, where the truth goes to die, titled  Obama Mentioned Sarah Palin Twice In 2 Weeks. She Has An Idea On What He Should Focus On Instead. Someone should compare that to how many times she has mentioned Obama in two weeks of her mad, delusional, drunken ravings. Palin, whose son recently had to deal with a little teeny incident in which he hit his girlfriend and made threats with a gun and the undisputed champion of the Great Birthday Party Drunken Brawl of 2014, learned very quickly (oh, let s face it   she probably learned nothing) what happens when you say stupid things about the President on the internet.There's a reason pro-American activists have been living rent free in President Obama's head these past eight  https://t.co/We0lNb2Lqh  Sarah Palin (@SarahPalinUSA) October 3, 2016Twitter responded with an epic barrage of truth and mockery, most centered on her strong and unwavering support for one of the few people in history who actually may be  worse than Hitler. @SarahPalinUSA like Trump has been living tax-free for the last twenty years?  jacqui rodham (@heyjdey) October 3, 2016@SarahPalinUSA @INJO you should thank Obama for mentioning you. you're sinking, thankfully, into obscurity  Clodagh Smith (@Clodagh831) October 3, 2016@SarahPalinUSA Unfunded liabilities?

Authorities call it a desecration of the Islamic worship center.The Quran, the holy book of Islam, prohibits Muslims from eating pork, and pigs have been used to taunt or offend Muslims.Both the FBI and Las Vegas police say they re investigating the case as a possible hate crime.Las Vegas police spokesman Larry Hadfield said the bacon was wrapped on the door knobs, and was also found on the ground and fences.Officials at the mosque couldn t immediately be reached for comment.The FBI said the incident happened about 3:15 a.m. Dec. 27.

21753,HAPPY MOTHER’S DAY…Your First Grader Just Rated Your Mommy Skills For Her Public School Teacher,"Rate your mom for Mother s Day sounds like the perfect project that only an intrusive, progressive public school teacher would assign. A first grade class at Ridgecrest Elementary in Cottonwood Heights, Utah, (and scads of other schools around the country, too, if the 1,994 downloads are any indication) made a Mother s Day  gift  to take home. Was it a sentimental card? A loving poem? Perhaps the impression of the child s hand forever memorialized in plaster of paris? No.Some teacher (or in this case it may have been Principal Teri Mattson) thought it was a grand idea to have six-year-olds rate their moms on personal behaviors. The  report card  reveals how well  the mom  lives up to expectations! Kids get to rate (with smiling, neutral, or frowning faces) their moms on these items:The mom cares for her children. The mom cooks healthy meals for her children. The mom has an organized bedroom. The mom takes time to enjoy her hobbies, such as reading. The mom works hard to make money for her family. The mom is funny and makes her children laugh. The mom takes care of herself by getting her hair done and taking bubble baths. The mom is a safe driver and does not get distracted when driving. Inspire Me, ASAP! the username of a woman who offers items on Teachers Pay Teachers created this worksheet. It is apparently receiving lots of positive feedback (and smiling faces!) with comments like:The moms will love these! How fun is this?! Can t wait to have my kiddos make this! Super adorable! Adorable idea. I can t wait to see their answers.Now the questions are:How many parents are going to speak up about this? How could teachers/administrators be this clueless? Whenever things like this happen, I see a ton of private griping and moaning and negative social media commentary. Few parents, however, are willing to push back.In a nutshell, parents are afraid of school employees. These taxpayer funded teachers and administrators hold so much power (grades, influence, activities, resources) that parents vehemently object in private while smiling and nodding in public.They work for us, people. They must be held accountable.Giving such a worksheet is not just invasive and stupid.

928, New Poll: WAY More Americans Want Trump Impeached Than Approve Of The Job He Is Doing,"Donald Trump has been notorious for touting poll numbers that look good for him. During the campaign, whenever he d careen into one of his many controversies and the numbers dipped, he and his mouthpieces would reference junk polls to show that people still loved The Donald. Of course, any poll that can be voted in a million times online is bogus. However, factual data isn t bogus, and that data does not look good for Trump right now. In fact, a new poll shows that way more Americans want Trump removed from office than the number of people who think he s doing a good job.According to new data from Public Policy Polling, 47 percent of Americans see Donald Trump as the incompetent, dangerously unstable buffoon he is, and want him impeached posthaste. On the other hand, just 37 percent believe he is actually a good president. That isn t surprising; after all, the slavish, blind devotion of his mouthbreathing base has not been a secret for nigh on two years now.On the other side of said insane base, there were marches around the nation for the holiday weekend demanding Trump s removal and protesting his administration and their policies. Further, more Democrats are becoming emboldened by these numbers and are actually drafting articles of impeachment. One such Democrat is Rep. Brad Sherman (D-CA). Speaking in his home district in Los Angeles, Rep. Sherman egged the anti-Trump crowd on, saying: We have to act now to protect our country from abuse of power and impulsive, ignorant incompetence. At this declaration, the crowd borrowed from Trump s own base, and shouted back:  LOCK HIM UP! Of course, there s one little difference between Trump s base and the Democrats   there s PLENTY of evidence to suggest that Trump is a criminal, while there is absolutely none to suggest the same about Hillary Clinton.Of course, there will be no impeachment until the Democrats take back the House of Representatives, and there will be no invocation of the 25th Amendment to remove and unfit  president  from office for the sake of the nation. Therefore, we MUST turn out in 2018, and make sure we control both chambers of Congress. That s the only way we get real, credible Congressional investigations into the Russia ordeal, and it s the only way we get rid of Trump and his criminal administration.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"July 5, 2017"
2267, Cory Booker SCORCHES Trump Over New Muslim Ban In BLISTERING Tweetstorm,"Well, the moment we have all been anticipating has come to pass. Donald Trump and the bigots in his administration have rolled out a new Muslim Ban. There are very few differences. It excludes Iraq, thanks to their vital role in helping the United States government in the fight against the Islamic State. It also will not be rolled out immediately, so that we won t have people being detained mid-travel. It also excludes Green Card holders and those with legal visas prior to January 27, 2017   the date of the original order that was struck down by the courts. there is also language striking down the first order. However, make no mistake   this is still a Muslim ban. The intent is the same, and there is one person who wants to make sure that everyone knows it: New Jersey Senator Cory Booker.Just moments after the news broke that Trump had signed the new order behind closed doors, Senator Booker took to Twitter to go all in on Trump and what he and his goons are doing.

9427,"WOW! Stepson Of New Roy Moore Accuser Makes Emotional Video…Says Stepmom is Lying: “For Whatever Reason She’s Doing This, I’m Truly Sorry”","Yesterday, Beverly Young Nelson sat with the same leftist lawyer, Gloria Allred, who came out after Donald Trump with false allegations of sexual harassment against Donald Trump before the election and made a public statement, claiming she was sexually assaulted by Judge Roy Moore when she was a teenager. Today, Beverly Young Nelson s son Darrel Nelson made a public Facebook video to let America know he s behind Judge Roy Moore and that believes his stepmother is not telling the truth about Judge Moore sexually assaulting her when she was a teen.Here is part of his transcript:Good evening. As I said today, I found out today, that my stepmother is one of the ladies that s accusing Judge Moore of an act that supposedly happened when she was a teenager. My father s name is John Allen Nelson. The woman that s committed this act against Mr. Moore, is Beverly Young Nelson. It s hard for me to actually have this conversation, but it must be done. Mr. Moore, I support you. I don t believe the acts that she s claimed you ve done. I don t believe it. I ve known the woman, she married my father many, many years ago, I ve known her for a while now, and I truly do not believe that she s being honest about this. You re a good judge. I ve growed up, I ve known your name since I was a kid. You cared about the ten commandments. You tried like hell to keep the ten commandments from being taken out of the courthouse. I remember. I ve been a member of Etowah County my whole life. I was born here. Now I m twisted. To you Mr. Moore, and to your wife, I do apologize. For whatever reason, she s doing this, and I am truly sorry. I stand behind you 100%. And to my stepmother, for whatever reasons you did this Why did you, I have a few questions about this: Why did you wait so long if this did happen? You waited, you said you were a teenager when it happened. Well, here it now, how many years later? And all of a sudden, now you re gonna bring it up when he s fixin  to go, and we done votin  him into the House, and you re trying to get him took out. I ve tried to keep quiet on your name because I see your name flying around everywhere.But I am a Moore supporter, but officially, this is the statement I ve been meaning to make. I know I m gonna get some backlash from my family, but that s okay. We the people made the decision. It s over. Democrats are taking a shot at it, using any and everybody they can get so they can tarnish his record, to get a Democrat to take his place. Well, I m sorry. We re not gonna have that. For whatever reason, she s done what she s done. This needs to end now. So with this official statement, I stand with Moore, all the way. I m reaching out to you Mr. Moore.

16435,"OBAMA STONEWALLING ON Why He Sent 13 Payments Of $99,999,999.99 To Iran…Where Was Congress?","Leave it to the one and only Andrew McCarthy to put together a fantastic case against Obama and his lying administration when it comes to the latest race on the Treasury. This time it was a raid on a Treasury slush fund to give $1.3 billion to Iran. The Iran Deal is a great example of just how corrupt and dysfunctional our government is. Please take the time to read this incredible overview of the inner workings of giving billions to Iran It s UNREAL!The structured transfers of $1.3 billion from a Treasury slush fund remain shrouded in mystery.  Confidentiality ? Yes, that s the State Department s story on why the Obama administration is stonewalling the American people regarding the president s illegal and increasingly suspicious Iransom payoff. The administration refuses to divulge any further information about the $1.7 billion the president acknowledges paying the world s leading state sponsor of terrorism.Grilled on Wednesday about how Obama managed to pay the final $1.3 billion installment   particularly given the president s claim that it is not possible to send Tehran a check or wire-transfer   State Department spokesman Mark Toner decreed that the administration would continue  withholding this information  in order  to protect confidentiality. Whose confidentiality? The mullahs ? That of the intermediaries the president used? Whose privacy takes precedence over our right to know how Obama funneled our money to our enemies?The closest thing to an answer we have to the latest round of questions comes courtesy of the perseverance of the investigative journalist Claudia Rosett. (You weren t expecting the Republican Congress to be minding the purse, were you?) Recall that we have been asking about the $1.3 billion payment since the first revelations about this sordid affair. After all, if, as Obama and his toadies maintain, the payment is totally on the up and up   just a routine legal settlement involving Iran s own money   then why won t they answer basic questions about it? Why are such matters as the administration s process in tapping a congressionally appropriated funding source for the settlement   a settlement Congress did not approve and seems to be in the dark about paying for   being treated as if they were state secrets so sensitive you d need have a Clinton.mail account (or be a Russian hacker of a Clinton.mail account) to see them?Generally speaking, the State, Treasury, and Justice Departments cannot issue press releases fast enough to salute themselves over legal settlements that supposedly benefit taxpayers by billions of dollars   at least according to the same math that brought you all those Obamacare savings. How is it that, in what is purportedly a completely aboveboard legal case, we are not permitted to know how our own money was transferred to the jihadist plaintiff?With the administration taking the Fifth, it was left to Claudia to crawl through Leviathan s catacombs. In her New York Sun report on Monday, we learned that she hit pay dirt: stumbling upon a bizarre string of 13 identical money transfers of $99,999,999.99 each   yes, all of them one cent less than $100 million   paid out of an obscure Treasury Department stash known as the  Judgment Fund.  The transfers were made   to whom, it is not said   on January 19, just two days after the administration announced it had reached the $1.7 billion settlement with Iran. They aggregate to just 13 cents shy of $1.3 billion, the same amount the State Department claims Iran was owed in  interest  from the $400 million that our government had been holding since the shah deposited it in a failed arms deal just prior to the Khomeini revolution. So, stacked atop of the pallets of $400 million in foreign cash that Obama arranged to shuttle from Geneva to Tehran as ransom (or, as the administration prefers,  leverage ) for the release of American hostages   via an unmarked cargo plane belonging to Iran Air, a terrorist arm of the mullahs  terrorist coordinator, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps   we now have a second whopping money transfer that (a) violates federal criminal laws against providing things of value to Iran and (b) looks like it was conceived by Nicky Barnes.Read more: NRO",Government News,"Aug 27, 2016"
4784, Black Religious Leaders DENOUNCE Trump As The Fraud That He Is,"Donald Trump recently attended a conservative, black church in Detroit in an effort to reach out to black voters. As expected, it was an embarrassment, and the black community was not fooled by Trump s pandering photo-op.Perhaps one of the mast damning of all criticism comes from across the board religious leaders, all of them black, from the Detroit metropolitan are. They all had the same message for Trump   we aren t fooled.The Council of Baptist Pastors of Detroit and Vicinity penned a scathing letter signed by representatives of 10 different Christian denominations on Saturday, blasting the opportunism of the Trump campaign and its brazen language and exploitation:We   have been avoided and overlooked in regards to the upcoming appearance of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump in Detroit   Racism, bigotry, misogyny, hate speech, sexism, divisiveness, threats, a call to harm, discrimination, bullying, and fearmongering have no place in the White House in the greatest country in the world.In addition to the Baptist leadership, representatives from the Metropolitan Organizing Strategy Enabling Strength; the Michigan chapter of Church of God in Christ; the Evangelical Lutheran, and Episcopal Church all signed on.In total, these religious organizations represent over 200 African-American churches in southeastern Michigan alone.The president of the Baptist Pastor s council, Rev. Lawrence Glass, blasted Trump as an insult to the African Americans and minorities, saying his attacks on Muslims, immigrants and Hispanics.Glass also pointed out that Trump  has no history of helping minorities, of going to the inner city to help out people of color  He has done absolutely nothing,  and  He wants us to believe him  He must think we re really, really naive and ignorant of his past practices. Although these churches and their leaders have a huge  disdain  for Trump, they have said that doesn t necessarily mean they re all in for Hillary Clinton.The chairman of Detroit Ecumenical Ministers, the Rev. Horace Sheffield, accused Trump of using blacks as  political props. Trump and his campaign thought they could trick black voters into supporting him by appealing to their religious convictions. Unlike the rabid, faux Christian evangelicals represented by people like Billy Graham and Michele Bachmann, black religious leaders actually follow by example. And Trump certainly does not fit their mold.Here s an important reminder for Trump: the most religious group in America are black women. Black women are also Democratic voters, and for good reason. They aren t so easily tricked by a predatory white nationalist.Another Trump  pivot  gone horribly wrong.Featured image via Mario Tama/Getty Images",News,"September 3, 2016"

5219, Crowd Erupts In Boos When Military Mom Asks Pence About Trump’s Khan Statements,"A Mike Pence rally in Nevada turned ugly when a military mom asked the vice presidential candidate about Donald Trump s recent statements regarding Khizr Khan and his wife Ghazala. Rally goers viciously booed her and demanded to know why she was even there in the first place.The woman, who was later identified as identified as Catherine Byrne. began by explaining that her son is serving in the Air Force. Of course, the crowd cheered enthusiastically. But when she continued, their mood quickly did an about face: Time and time again, [Donald] Trump has disrespected our nation s armed forces and veterans. And his disrespect for Mr. Khan  That was as far as she got before the crowd became vicious, booing her so fiercely that they drowned out her words. Why are you here?  one woman screamed angrily. But Byrne continued to speak You ve got a son in the military, how do you tolerate this disrespect? Pence finally stepped in after about 10 seconds and began to hush the crowd. That s OK,  he said. Pence then reiterated what he and said when he was confronted by protesters in Ohio last week: That s what freedom looks like, and that s what freedom sounds like. Pence then praised Capt. Humayun Khan and his family. Khan was killed in Iraq while serving in the United States military. His parents made headlines when they appeared at the Democratic National Convention and blasted Trump for his anti-Muslim rhetoric. The Republican nominee responded to Khizr Khan s criticism of his bigoted policies by attack them. Capt. Khan is an American hero and we honor him and honor his family,  he said.  The story of Capt. Khan is an incredibly inspiring story. But in the next breath, Pence defended Trump. I have never been around someone more devoted to the armed forces of this country,  Pence said of Trump.  There is no one more devoted to the veterans in this country. One of the people booing Byrne was Denise Martinez. She said that she admired how Pence had dealt with the tense situation. I thought he handled it really, really well,  she said.  Looking back, I think I would ve taken the high road. He handled it the right way, the way I wish Trump would have,  she added.Barbara Weisenthal was another woman who was booing. In her opinion, Khizr Khan had no right  to speak about Trump the way he did at the DNC and his entire speech  was almost like slander. Weisenthal added that the rally was  probably not the best place  for Byrne to ask her question.Jack Christenson, who is a veteran himself, argued that even though Byrne had the right to speak out thanks to the Constitution, she didn t have the right  to violate everyone else s rights  by asking a question of a person running to be vice president.Roen Horn said Byrne was claiming that Trump was  somehow insulting the veterans,  which he said was  a bunch of crap. She was politicizing the veterans,  he said.  She had an agenda. Featured image via Ralph Freso/Getty Images ",News,"August 2, 2016"

People just like Gary Cohn. In fact, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimates that the top 1 percent of Americans would get half of the tax cuts under Trump s plan. By eliminating the estate tax, the plan would benefit Trump, his family, and other wealthy Americans. So, now we know why Trump was so vague during his short speech in Indiana on Wednesday.We re wondering what Mr. Fancy Pants thinks a new house costs. By the way, the estimated average transaction price of a new car or truck in 2015 was $33,560. We re sure that s higher now. Mr. Cohn was only off by $32,560. He was soooo close. Missed it by that much! The average cost to renovate a kitchen is actually $21,797.

18673,BREAKING REPORT: ANTIFA THUGS PLACE BOUNTY On Head Of Black Patriot Defending Confederate Monuments [VIDEO],"The next time you hear someone talk about how it s a shame our country is so divided, make sure you tell them to thank a Democrat. We got a glimpse of the underbelly of the Democrat Party during the presidential election when the founder of Project Veritas James O Keefe went undercover to expose the Democrats plan to create chaos and violence and blame it on Trump supporters. The man in the video, Robert Creamer who bragged about his organizing skills had visited Obama s White House over 340 times. He is also the husband of a Democrat Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky of IL. Once the real riots got rolling in NYC and Chicago, and Antifa was gaining steam in Berkeley, CA, it was discovered that billionaire radical Democrat George Soros was actually paying to keep the riots going. So it really shouldn t come as any surprise that these basement dwellers have put a bounty on a black man s head simply for having a different political opinion than that of the one he was told he must follow Andrew Duncomb, aka  Black Rebel  has been an outspoken advocate of southern history, and specifically of the Confederate flag and Confederate monuments. We published an article about two great black patriots, the  Black Rebel  and Arlene Dunham, who have bravely stood in the face of hate and insults to defend for what their beliefs. But tonight, new information is coming out about a bounty that has been placed on the head of Duncomb, who according to friends in New Orleans, has gone into hiding.Here is  Black Rebel  telling viewers on his Facebook page about how they can t get any help or protection from police.

1496, Congress Demands White House Turn Over Alleged Comey Tape Mentioned In Trump’s Tweet (LETTER),"During yet another Twitter fit on Friday morning, Donald Trump seems to be unraveling before our eyes under the pressure of the press and ongoing investigations into his campaign ties to Russia.Earlier in the week, Trump fired James Comey who was the Director of the FBI. Now, in an effort to seemingly almost blackmail Comey so he doesn t leak any pertinent information regarding investigations, Trump tweeted:James Comey better hope that there are no ""tapes"" of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 12, 2017Well, members of Congress saw this tweet and are holding him accountable for what is being implied. Quite honestly, it s about time Congress starts taking Trump s tweets seriously.Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-IL) had this to say: Earlier this morning, President Trump wrote a tweet referencing his taping of high-level conversations in the White House. In light of this revelation, I would respectfully request that the White House Counsel provide the House Oversight Committee with all tapes of the President s communications with former FBI Director James Comey, of President Trump s meeting with Russian officials which was closed to American press but not their Russian counterparts, and of any conversations regarding the hiring or firing of former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn. These White House tapes could accelerate current investigations as previous tapes have aided past inquiries. Here is the official letter to White House Counsel Donald McGhan with the request:via krishnamoorthi.house.govIf Trump is going to use his Twitter account to relay information not only to the public but to the legislative branch of government, he better be prepared to face the consequences of his words.If there are tapes, this isn t only damning for Comey, but also Trump himself. He seems to think he can manipulate this whole situation like some sort of deal in a boardroom. This isn t a boardroom. This is the United States government, and good on Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi for calling him out.Featured Photo by Getty Images",News,"May 12, 2017"
7272, Ted Nugent Insults Women Everywhere By Disgustingly Listing Why Men Prefer Guns (IMAGE),"Ted Nugent is once again degrading a segment of the population and this time he targeted women.In a Facebook post devoted to his love of his guns, all of which he has undoubtedly f*cked repeatedly, the conservative rocker listed the reasons why men prefer their guns over women. You can trade an old 44 for a new 22,  Nugent wrote as reason number ten on the offensive list, which then became even more cringe-worthy as it continued.Nugent went on to explain how  You can keep one gun at home and have another for when you re on the road,  and even went so far as to say that women don t act normally all month long like guns do even though PMS is a normal bodily function that all women go through in their lives.In his top reason, Nugent lamented that he can t make women shut their mouths like keeping a gun silent with a silencer.Here s his full post via Facebook.// < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3""; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); // ]]&gt;Top ten reasons men prefer guns over women-#10   You can trade an old 44 for a new 22.#9   You can keep one gun at Posted by Ted Nugent on Thursday, March 24, 2016This isn t the first time the Donald Trump fan has acted like a complete asshole toward women.According to Media Matters,  Nugent has a lengthy history of misogynist commentary, including calling women  worthless bitch,   worthless whore,   toxic cunt,   fat pig,  and  dirty whore. And in a disgusting defense of Trump, who is in the middle of trying to portray himself as the best candidate for women, Nugent went on a tirade against Fox News host Megyn Kelly in which the Motor City Madman said: I often turn on Fox just to look at her. Sometimes when I m loading my [gun ammunition] magazines, I like to just look at her. And I usually sit naked on the couch dropping hot brass on my stuff. Not only does Nugent prefer guns to real women, he also prefers teen girls over women as well. He wrote and performed a song about raping a 13-year-old girl in 1981. Two years earlier, Nugent suckered a 17-year-old girl s parents into making him her legal guardian so he could have sex with her.In short, not only is Nugent a coward when it comes time for real men to take action in defense of their country, he s terrified of strong independent women who think for themselves.

7001, Trump’s Own Children Won’t Be Voting For Him — Here’s Why,"There are at least two votes on which Donald Trump can t count in the New York primary   the daughter he badly wants to f*ck and his son, Eric. This might seem crazy at first   after all, Ivanka has been campaigning hard for daddy, and Eric Trump appeared alongside his brother as the latter offered to ship their father s black critics out of the country. But as crazy as it seems, it is true.The state of New York has incredibly strict voter registration laws   ones that promise to create issues for people of both parties. As with many states, New York operates on a  closed primary  system. Simply put, you cannot vote in a party s primary unless you are registered with that party. Normally, simply switching parties would solve the issue nicely, but the Empire State has the earliest change-of-party deadline in the country   October 9 (of last year), which is six months before the primary election.Yahoo News reports that both Eric and Ivanka are not registered as Republicans in the state:Donald Trump s three oldest children have campaigned with their father and served as surrogates during the presidential race. But only one of them is actually a member of the party Trump hopes to lead.Records from the New York State Board of Elections show that neither Ivanka Trump nor Eric Trump is enrolled in a political party. Trump s oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., is a Republican.In other words, only the son who actively courted white supremacists on behalf of his father is able to vote for him in the upcoming primary. Sure, they support him, but it has to be humiliating for The Donald that two of his oldest children will not be casting a ballot for him.Registration for new voters in New York is more lenient, with a deadline of March 25   but even if Ivanka and Eric are unregistered, it is still too late for them to cast a vote for The Annoying Orange.This could also be bad news for Bernie Sanders, who has been swiftly closing the gap between himself and Hillary Clinton in the state. Since he has been converting people of varying political persuasions since he announced his candidacy, it is likely that many of his supporters will not be able to cast a ballot for him. Think Progress reports:When it comes to New York s fast-approaching presidential primary election, Lerner said potential voters from both parties would likely be impacted by New York s strict election rules. But she said that people voting for  the two non-establishment candidates    Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and billionaire Donald Trump   would bear the brunt of the confusion. That s because voters for those candidates were more likely to have been previously unaffiliated with a political party, or more likely to have wanted to switch parties to vote for their preferred candidate.Sanders supporters even set up a page back in October raising the alarm about the change-of-party deadline for independents and voters registered with more liberal factions like the Green Party or the Liberal Party.So far, it seems true that non-establishment candidates like Trump and Sanders tend to do better in open primaries, where people can vote in whichever party s primary they choose.Both Sanders and Trump stand to take a hard hit from New York s strict party-switching regulations, though he is sure to be a hit among first-time voters, who registered in record numbers in New York this year. The full impact of already-registered voters who wanted to switch parties to vote for the candidate of their choice remains to be seen, but one thing is certain   Trump s kids will be sitting this primary out.Featured Image via Getty/Jeff J.

7195, Missouri Republican Laughed At For Saying He’s A Reproductive Expert Because He Was An Embryo,"One of the most embarrassing moments in politics this week happened in Missouri.During a debate in the Missouri House Committee on Children and Families, GOP state Rep. Mike Moon declared that since he was once an embryo that means he is a qualified reproductive health expert who knows what he is talking about when it comes to abortion and whether or not an embryo is a person.And yes, people laughed at him.The hearing was about House Joint Resolution 98, which would ban abortion in the state by enshrining the right to life of  unborn human children at every stage of biological development  in the Missouri Constitution.According to the Columbia Missourian, Moon  opened the hearing by showing a video of an unborn fetus on a display monitor. The fetus was developed enough to make out undeniably human characteristics, such as hands and a face. A precious sight, I think most of us would agree,  Moon declared.  The more you look at that, the more you have to realize that that is a human being. Moon went on to compare abortion to slavery before making more of an ass of himself by concluding,  As a former embryo myself, I would like protection for all embryos.  After the laughter died down, a real health expert testified against the resolution.St, Louis physician Ed Weisbart said there is no scientific consensus for when life begins and that women should have the final choice to end their pregnancy or not.Meanwhile, the United States Constitution, which supersedes state law, says plainly in the 14th Amendment that only  all persons born  are granted citizenship under the jurisdiction of the United States.In other words, the Constitution does not consider unborn fetuses as persons under the law.Plus, banning abortion would take away the fundamental rights of due process and equal protection from women, which is unconstitutional.Not only would the Supreme Court be duty-bound to overturn HJR 98, it would cost Missouri taxpayers millions of dollars to fund a losing cause.And if Missouri conservatives really want to continue to argue, they should consider that even their Bible does not consider fetuses to be persons.Also, being an embryo at one time does not make anyone an expert on reproductive issues. It s like saying you re an expert pastry chef because you once made mud pies as a child. That just doesn t fly.The bottom line is that women should have the choice and Republicans need to back off and stop trying to force their religious beliefs down their throats, especially when those beliefs contradict what their Bibles actually say. But the Bible shouldn t matter anyway because the Constitution has already clearly defined personhood and it starts at birth.Featured Image: Imgur",News,"March 30, 2016"
1539, Ranking Dem On House Russia Probe Has EXPLOSIVE News For Trump That Will Have Him Running Scared,"As everybody who still believes in democracy and true freedom reels from FBI Director James Comey s firing, the media and members of Congress have been frantically working to get the deets on what happened. Rep. Adam Schiff, the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee (which is conducting its own investigation into Russia), just dropped a truth bomb about Comey, and Trump would be wise to go find a cave and hide in it now.Schiff was asked, on CNN, whether he believes this is a cover-up. He doesn t. He thinks it s something worse: It s a brazen interference with a criminal investigation. After all, the president calls this whole investigation a fake, and here you had an FBI director who was seriously looking into whether Trump associates were colluding with the Russians. The end of his statement to CNN should be particularly jarring to anybody familiar with history. Watch below:Rep. Adam Schiff on firing of FBI Director James Comey:  It s a brazen interference with a criminal investigation  https://t.co/5SXgAuTVBP  CNN (@CNN) May 10, 2017Earlier this year, the White House tried to get the FBI to publicly dispute stories appearing in The New York Times about contacts between Trump s associates and Russian actors. They ve been trying to bend the FBI to their will for a long time, and when Comey wouldn t lie under oath for them, or end his Russia probe, Trump decided to fire him.In fact, Jeff Sessions was actually told to find reasons to fire Comey, and they ve been working on it for at least a week. Trump likely wants someone in that position who ll end that investigation before they discover something really damning. He wants a puppet.If Trump was innocent, the White House wouldn t have been looking for reasons to fire Comey now. Comey may not have even been fired, but if he was, Trump probably would have done it when he took office under the guise of getting a fresh start, as Schiff said to CNN. This is not the behavior of an innocent man.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"May 9, 2017"
7117, Protesters Bring 51-Foot Long Joint To White House Demanding Marijuana Be Rescheduled (VIDEO),"On Saturday, pro-marijuana activists held a massive demonstration outside of the White House.The activists called on President Obama to reschedule marijuana down from a Schedule 1 controlled substance. A Schedule 1 controlled substance, marijuana is legally considered to be as dangerous as heroin. That s an especially cruel joke when one takes into consideration that medical marijuana is proving to actually help reduce opiate addiction.One of the most popular tourist destinations in DC is looking, and smelling, more like a reggae concert. pic.twitter.com/b2tbmkQCCm  Alex Mallin (@alex_mallin) April 2, 2016Activists openly smoked marijuana during the protest, in an attempt to show just how little danger smoking marijuana actually is.

No arrests were made during the demonstration.Protestors brought along with them a 51-foot inflatable joint.

As long as cannabis is treated in the same category of drugs as heroin, with no accepted medical use, police will continue to arrest & lockup our brothers and sisters. Marijuana is currently legal in 23 states in some form. Of those 23, marijuana is legal for recreational use in four states and Washington D.C. After legalizing marijuana, those states have seen jaw-dropping amounts of sales tax revenue come in from legalized marijuana.https://www.facebook.com/ajplusenglish/videos/vb.407570359384477/711454438996066/?type=2&theaterHowever, as marijuana is still a Schedule 1 controlled substance, states have proven to be hesitant to legalize the drug unless voters force them to by means of a ballot initiative. This makes the state-by-state approach to marijuana legalization incredibly slow.In 2014, a pot arrest was made once every 45 seconds in the United States. That s nearly 701,000 people who have had their lives shattered for simply having marijuana in their possession.Every day people continue to be arrested for marijuana possession in the war on drugs. A war that is, in reality, nothing more than a war against communities of color and the poor. Featured Image from AJ+ video screenshot via Facebook",News,"April 3, 2016"
18188,"WHILE DEMOCRATS Were Focused On Russia and P*ssy Hats, President Trump Quietly Accomplished Something So Awesome, It Will Leave Conservatives Cheering","The Democrats and their allies in the media would like you to believe that President Trump has been so distracted by their allegations and by the untold number of  unnamed sources  they ve quoted in their fabricated stories about him, that he s been virtually paralyzed by the negative press. They d like you to believe he s been so distracted by their antics, that he s been unable to accomplish any of his campaign promises That is 180 degrees from the truth. And that s the case across a wide range of issues, but none is so important   or of long-lasting consequence   as the judiciary.So here s an update on Trump s judicial nominations, as compared to Obama, Bush 2, Clinton, and Reagan. Like Trump, each replaced a President of the other party and each came into office with a Senate of their own party. G.W. Bush made 15 of those 44 nominations on August 2, 2001.1. President Trump has made more judicial nominations at this point than Obama, Clinton, and Reagan combined, all of them outstanding.2. Chuck Grassley, Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, has held hearings for more judicial nominees at this point than the Committee held under any of these previous Presidents.3. Despite having to take a cloture vote on every nominee, the Senate has confirmed more judges so far than under these previous Presidents.That s just an incredible record, particularly with regard to the extremely high quality of these picks. And we should be very grateful: it was not at all obvious, even to many of the most ardent Trump supporters, that Donald Trump would be good on judges, given that this is far from his obvious area either of expertise or interest.But in fact, at the rate he s going at present, Donald Trump may well prove to be the best President in American history on judges. And of all the things he might achieve, that is orders of magnitude more important than all the rest.  Rod D. Martin",left-news,"Aug 7, 2017"

Barrag n said she did not receive one herself, and would not name those who did, citing their safety.One of the calls went to  a member who was not on the [Democratic baseball] team,  she said,  and other Democratic members expressed concern that they were getting calls saying,  You Democrats, you Democrats. Overall, there has been an uptick in threats to Democrats recently. Even House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said she has received threats. Rep. Al Green (D-TX) said he s received threats over his plans to impeach Donald Trump.Buzzfeed s article quotes several people who have received threats.While voters on both sides are going to continue to point fingers, it s clear that we have a problem in this country and it s bigger than guns. Anger, whether it emanates from Donald Trump s partisan and often violent rhetoric, from popular culture, or from the fact that people are feeling left behind by our leaders, is real.

He has seemingly restored grace and dignity back to the Vatican, where most people were losing hope and feared that corruption and deceit had taken too much of a stronghold. Pope Francis  humble nature and openness to the world has the world humming with gratitude for a return to solemnity within the Vatican walls, so wherever he goes, massive crowds follow who want to meet him, or if anything, merely catch a glimpse.However, it looks as though one person became too eager and failed to recognize others around them in their own selfish desire to come into contact with the Pontiff.According to Inside Edition: In a rare sight of public agitation, Pope Francis lost his composure as he greeted a crowd of worshippers in Morella, Mexico. When a devotee grabbed him by his cassock and wouldn t let go, it caused the Pontiff to fall into a wheelchair-bound man. The Pope sternly told the man in Spanish  don t be selfish.  Pope Francis recovered and kissed the man on the head following the incident. He waved to people in the open-air gathering for a few more minutes after the incident before leaving. Pope Francis was exactly right to get mad at what this person was doing to him and made him do to another. They were being selfish and needed to be told that what they were doing was unacceptable. And as far as the Pope showing he was upset, that s more than okay, too.

According to retired Army Colonel Lawrence Wilkerson, the move was completely  amateur  and  grossly inexperienced. Trump had made this disgusting display while he dedicated the USS Gerald R. Ford. He completely went off message by demanding that the military audience support his extremely unpopular, unethical health care bill, which would strip health care from 22 million people and cut Medicaid drastically. In his speech, Trump subjected his audience to his truly embarrassing behavior when he said: Call those senators to make sure you get health care.

Under no circumstance will Mexico pay for the wall that Mr. Trump is proposing,  he said.  Building a wall between Mexico and the United States is a terrible idea. It is an idea based on ignorance and has no foundation in the reality of North American integration.

5679, Trump Accuses Clinton Of ‘Raping Our Country’,"In a statement that was attempting to appeal to the left and to the worst conspiracy theorists on the right, Donald Trump accused his female opponent of raping the country with a trade deal.In a campaign rally in Pennsylvania, the GOP frontrunner ranted about free trade agreements. He wants to force Canada and Mexico to renegotiate NAFTA and he wants to renegotiate the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP).Trump s words were tailored to his audience, many of whom have personally suffered from the collapse of the American steel industry: I m going tell our NAFTA partners that I intend to immediately renegotiate the terms of that agreement to get a better deal for our workers. And I don t mean just a little bit better, I mean a lot better,  Trump said in Pennsylvania.If Canada and Mexico do not agree to renegotiate the pact, Trump said he would notify them under the agreement s terms  that America intends to withdraw from the deal. Source: Huffington PostOf course, most of the steel industry has moved to China, a country with whom we have no trade agreement, but why let inconvenient facts get in the way of a good narrative.In yet another speech, this time in Ohio, Trump spoke of the TTP, calling it a  death blow  for American manufacturing. He said it was  just a continuing rape of our country. Trump is right in that the trade deals have been bad for the American people and that they should be renegotiated, but Trump s claim that he s a savior for American trade is disingenuous. Much of Trump s fortune has been built on the backs of those in foreign countries. In other words, the Trump of today would probably not have been possible without the trade agreements he loves to criticize. AFL-CIO s President Richard Trumka agrees: Trump embodies everything that is wrong with our current trade policy. He has consistently sent American jobs overseas to line his own pockets. Beyond that, though, is something more insidious and sexist. It s long been a Republican meme that Bill Clinton is a rapist and that Hillary Clinton is somehow complicit in these  crimes  (they aren t actually crimes because no one has ever found any criminal activity). Trump may or may not choose to be overt in rattling off the hundreds of Clinton conspiracy theories, but you can bet he ll continue with the more subliminal accusations, like one of rape. Ironic, since he s been accused of the same.Featured image via Jeff Swensen at Getty Images.",News,"June 29, 2016"

21410,THE TALLY IS IN: Total Number Of Lies Told By Queen Of The Clinton Crime Syndicate During Debate,"Thanks to Ben Shapiro of Breitbart News, we now know the answer to that question:Tuesday night s debate featured a master class on lying from the lying liar who lies about her lies, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.She spoke for approximately 24 minutes, and aside from her opening statement    I m Hillary Clinton    virtually every word that exited her mouth was untrue. But because Hillary appeared to be lady with mild socialist depression in a full-blown socialist insane asylum, nobody laid a glove on her.Thus it is left to us to debunk her various obfuscations and untruths. Here we go. I have spent a very long time   my entire adult life   looking for ways to find the ways for each child to live up to his or her God-given potential.  Well, unless you re an unborn child. Then, get ready for a trip down the sink. Yes, finally, fathers will be able to say to their daughters, you, too, can grow up to be president.  Technically, you ll have to marry a president first, however. Actually, I have been very consistent.  Anderson Cooper asked Hillary about her shifting positions on issues ranging from the Iraq war to same-sex marriage to the Trans-Pacific Partnership. She then dropped that whopper. Hillary has been one of the least consistent major party candidates in American history. She then dropped a series of lies about her own positional changes. And then she finally concluded that she had a  range of views, but they are rooted in my values and my experience.  Those values are  becoming president  and her experience is  reading the polls. I did say, when I was secretary of state, three years ago, that I hoped it would be the gold standard. It was just finally negotiated last week, and in looking at it, it didn t meet my standards.  This is plainly untrue. Here s what she said in 2012 about the TPP:  This TPP sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open free, transparent, fair trade, the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field.  She didn t hope it would be the gold standard. It was the gold standard. Naturally, PolitiFact labeled this statement  half-true.  That means it s a huge, glaring lie. I m a progressive. But I m a progressive who likes to get things done how to find common ground, and I have proved that in every position that I ve had, even dealing with Republicans who never had a good word to say about me, honestly.  Nope. As Senator from New York, Hillary accomplished virtually nothing. Her name was attached to exactly zero legislation. Her only major impact on policy came in the form of Hillarycare, which drove Republicans to massive electoral victory in 1994. When I think about capitalism, I think about all the small businesses that were started  The media drooled over the exchange between Hillary and Bernie over capitalism. But there is no distinction between the economic philosophy of Sen. Bernie Sanders and that of Hillary Clinton. She said she wanted to use government to force companies to  share profits with the workers    a line straight from the Marxist playbook. She said she wanted the wealthy to  pay their fair share    which meant everything. She said she wanted paid family leave, universal college tuition availability, and a bevy of other free goodies. It was pretty straightforward to me that [Sanders] was going to give immunity to the only industry in America. Everybody else has to be accountable, but not the gun manufacturers.  There is no special immunity for gun manufacturers. The Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act of 2005 was designed to prevent ultra-leftist jurisdictions from twisting tort law to make gun manufacturers liable for  public nuisance  in the way that manufacturers are liable for their pollution. The law does not stop lawsuits against manufacturers or dealers from being sued if they knowingly sell a product to a criminal. They can still be sued for design flaws, or negligence. Well first of all, we got a lot of business done with the Russians when Medvedev was the president, and not Putin .There s no doubt that when Putin came back in and said he was going to be President, that did change the relationship.  Nonsense. Putin was always the leader of Russia, even when Medvedev was his puppet. Hillary knew Putin ran the country when Medvedev was president; Medvedev, for example, was president when Russia invaded Georgia in 2008. Hillary handed the Russians a reset button anyway. Hillary also advocated for taking on Bashar Assad   the same man she once called a  reformer. I think while you re talking about the tough decision that President Obama had to make about Osama bin Laden, where I was one of his few advisers, or putting together that coalition to impose sanctions on Iran  Glomming onto the kill of Osama Bin Laden in order to explain her vote for the Iraq war was simply nonsensical. But the idea that she  put together the coalition to impose sanctions on Iran  is simply untrue. International sanctions against Iran have been on the books for decades. And Hillary was integrally involved in negotiating the end of those sanctions, as well as letting Iran enrich uranium. We had a murderous dictator, Gadhafi, who had American blood on his hands, as I m sure you remember, threatening to massacre large numbers of the Libyan people  Our response, which I think was smart power at its best, is that the United States will not lead this.  Hillary reportedly manufactured the Libyan genocide story out of wholecloth, and overrode US intelligence in order to push that narrative. If Libya was  smart power at its best,  it would be incredible to find out what  smart power at its worst  would be (well, other than Syria, Ukraine, Iran ). Libya became a haven for terrorists because we deposed a dictator who posed no threat to us. The notion that Iraq was a disaster area of American foreign policy but Libya is a great success story is patently insane. Hillary s lies about Libya didn t end there. I ll get to that.  Hillary said this with regard to Benghazi. She never did, of course. Her response mirrored her response in Benghazi, by the way:  I ll get back to that,  she said to our Libyan staff, then proceeded to do nothing. I think it has to be continued threat from the spread of nuclear weapons, nuclear material that can fall into the wrong hands. I know the terrorists are constantly seeking it, and that s why we have to stay vigilant, but also united around the world to prevent that.  Hillary said the spread of nuclear weapons represented the chief threat to the United States. She also negotiated the Iran nuclear deal. The statement that people around the world are united to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons is a plain lie, given the acceptance of the Iran deal, which makes Iranian nuclear development inevitable. Well, I ve taken responsibility for it. I did say it was a mistake. What I did was allowed by the State Department, but it wasn t the best choice. And I have been as transparent as I know to be, turning over 55,000 pages of my e-mails, asking that they be made public. And you re right. I am going to be testifying. I ve been asking to testify for some time and to do it in public, which was not originally agreed to.  Lies, lies, and more lies. She did not take responsibility for her email scandal any more than she took responsibility for Benghazi: she said she  took responsibility  but never admitted to having done anything wrong. Her email scheme was not allowed by federal law, but she was the head of the State Department and thus waived rules for herself. She may have been as transparent as she knows how to be, but that transparency involved setting up a private server, loading it with classified information, and then deleting some 30,000 emails. She only asked to testify after Congress demanded she testify. Fortunately, none of this mattered, since Bernie Sanders intervened to hand her his testicles in a jar by saying nobody cared about her emails. This inequality challenge we face, we have faced it at other points. It s absolutely right. It hasn t been this bad since the 1920s. But if you look at the Republicans versus the Democrats when it comes to economic policy, there is no comparison. The economy does better when you have a Democrat in the White House and that s why we need to have a Democrat in the White House in January 2017.  If Democrats are so great at economics, why is inequality as bad as it has been in a century? And saying that Democratic presidents preside over good economies seems to neglect the fact that Bill Clinton, for example, presided over a Republican Congress. We have to deal with the problem that the banks are still too big to fail. We can never let the American taxpayer and middle class families ever have to bail out the kind of speculative behavior that we saw.  In this debate, Hillary Clinton also backed Dodd-Frank, which legally enshrines too big to fail. Bailouts are now mandated by federal law, thanks to Hillary Clinton and Democrats. And Democratic policy loves bailouts   they are huge fans of crony capitalism, endless bailouts through stimulus packages and taxpayer giveaways. I think that it was necessary to make sure that we were able after 9/11 to put in place the security that we needed. And it is true that it did require that there be a process. What happened, however, is that the Bush administration began to chip away at that process. And I began to speak out about their use of warrantless surveillance and the other behavior that they engaged in.  Hillary Clinton voted to reauthorize the Patriot Act in 2006. And Hillary s supposed leadership against Bush-era abuses of the Patriot Act didn t stop President Obama from expanding the use of surveillance far beyond what Bush ever did. Well, I can t think of anything more of an outsider than electing the first woman president, but I m not just running because I would be the first woman president .Well, I would not ask anyone to vote for me based on my last name.  False and false. California has had a paid leave program for a number of years .And it has not had the ill effects that the Republicans are always saying it will have.  California uses employee payroll taxes to finance paid family leave. That means all the costs of the program are hidden, rather than explicit. Businesses leave California and employment declines because of its high tax rates. Businesses hire fewer women if forced to pay higher taxes in order to do so. They don t mind having big government to interfere with a woman s right to choose and to try to take down Planned Parenthood. They re fine with big government when it comes to that. I m sick of it.  Republicans want to defund Planned Parenthood. That s not big government. That s small government. Further, it s not  big government  to protect human life through force of law any more than it is  big government  to have murder laws on the books. I know we can afford it, because we re going to make the wealthy pay for it. That is the way to get it done.  This myth, repeated ad nauseum by Democrats, is truly reprehensible. Rich people cannot pay for all the utopian programs proposed by the left. As John Stossel points out,  If the IRS grabbed 100 percent of income over $1 million, the take would be just $616 billion.  Both Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton worshipped at the altar of Denmark last night, but Denmark has lower corporate tax rates than the United States, and far higher taxes on the middle class. You pay a 200 percent tax on cars in Denmark   everyone. Socialism isn t built on the backs of the rich. It s built on the backs of everyone who earns, and that includes the middle class. Well, in addition to the NRA, the health insurance companies, the drug companies, the Iranians.  The Iranians are not Hillary s enemies. They love her.For entire list of lies, go to Breitbart NewsHillary s a liar. But Democrats don t care, because liars prosper in a world where hard work and honesty are punished in the name of equality and the Great Socialist Utopia.",left-news,"Oct 16, 2015"
4355, Trump’s Former Accountant Breaks Silence To Shut Down Trump’s Tax Lies (VIDEO),"One of the most insane things about Republican nominee Donald Trump is that even when he massively f*cks up, he can t help but brag about how  smart  and  brilliant  he is! This has been especially true when it comes to his shady tax returns, which he still refuses to release to the American people despite several promises to be transparent.If you watched the first presidential debate between Trump and Hillary Clinton last week, you saw Trump shamelessly boast about how  smart  he was for not paying federal income taxes. And after recent reports discovered that the business mogul hasn t paid taxes in almost two decades, Trump claimed to have  brilliant , superior knowledge of America s tax codes, which allows him to manipulate the system to his advantage. Well, the truth is coming out now that an ex-accountant of Trump has come forward.Jack Mitnick, one of Trump s former accountants, has given an interview with Inside Edition that exposes another one of Trump s many lies. Mitnick was the accountant cited in the 1995 tax returns that were recently leaked, where Trump was shown to have lost a staggering one billion dollars in a year. According to Mitnick, Trump doesn t even know anything about taxes, even though he claims to. Mitnick said: I did all the tax preparation. He never saw the product until it was presented to him for signature  I m the one who did all the work. This sounds exactly like typical Trump   taking full credit for the hard work of other people. The only thing Trump did that was perhaps  smart  was to hire a savvy accountant   and yet he continues to try and convince America that his knowledge of how the tax system works makes him the better presidential candidate. It s seriously pathetic!You can watch Mitnick s interview below, in which he exposes Trump as a lying fraud:Featured image via Spencer Platt / Getty Images",News,"October 5, 2016"
9264,KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO],"Former British Army officer, outspoken, conservative, radio and tv talk show host, Katie Hopkins warned Americans to fight back against the appeasement and political correctness in the United States of America.British conservative icon, Katie Hopkins gave a blistering speech about the dangers of political correctness and appeasement at the David Horowitz Restoration weekend in Palm Beach, Florida. Look at us, let us be a warning. Be better than us. I ve watched my country fall apart, and I want to warn others before they let their country do the same. And believe me, I love my country. Katie touched on many topics that most Americans are afraid to address. Hopkins reveals a horrifying story of a Muslim woman, who along with her boyfriend, was recently sentenced to prison, after a plot to behead Hopkins was uncovered. Hopkins also shares horrifying stories of multiple British citizens who have lost their lives, their limbs or suffer serious scars, as a result of acts of jihad against them by Muslim immigrants in their homeland of  Great Britain, after their nation welcomed them in with open arms. Do not allow America to fall as Europe has fallen, Hopkins told the crowd.Hopkins started out her speech with her usual biting and politically incorrect humor, by assuring the crowd she is not the outspoken, gay, conservative Milo Yiannopoulis. She then assured the audience that she was not gay simply because she wears her short. In fact, Hopkins calls herself a minority in London, because she s a white, married, mother of three, telling the audience that she s now on the  extinct list  in the UK.Hopkins tells of the time she spent in the migrant camps in Calais and tells horrifying stories of how the workers conform to the rule of Islam, so as not to offend the migrants they are taking care of. She tells a story of a mother who dresses her young daughter as a son, so the migrant men don t come into their tent to rape her daughter at night.  Hopkins admitted that she was  naive , and that she quickly realized,  Migrants don t come for a new life and leave their old life behind. They bring them with them. All the old conflicts from back home. The Eritreans hate the Somalis who hate the Afghanis who don t speak to the Libyans. And they re still fighting. They come, they do not start a new life, they bring their conflicts from back home. Watch Hopkins powerful speech here (some language may be offensive):",politics,"Dec 6, 2017"

And one person who is standing up to defend the famed actress is none other than famed actor/director Ron Howard.Taking to Twitter, and taking aim at a few Twitter troll, egg profiles and all, Howard lays out some solid facts. He tweeted: Trump used his fame to speak out on issues years before he ran 4 office. why was he allowed & Ms Streep should keep quiet? no hypocrisy please. trump used his fame to speak out on issues years before he ran 4 office. why was he allowed & Ms Streep should keep quiet? no hypocrisy pls https://t.co/CrpSCREcrw  Ron Howard (@RealRonHoward) January 9, 2017Then when a troll responded:@RealRonHoward It would be nice if Streep had any idea of the facts!

He can t handle people criticizing him and calling him out on things he very much did.Good on Howard for defending Streep, as we all must because she was absolutely on point in her criticism.

16485,HILLARY’S ANTI-TRUMP MUSLIM DAD Claims Terror Has “Nothing To Do With Islam”…Tries To Convince Americans Trump’s Desire To Protect Us From Terror Is Somehow Evil [VIDEO],"We ve inserted our thoughts and a few tweets throughout this article. Our comments can be found in bold red type.Let s start with Trump s Twitter response to Mr. Kahn s passionate speech denouncing Trump at Hillary s coronation. I don t think too many Americans can argue with this:I was viciously attacked by Mr. Khan at the Democratic Convention. Am I not allowed to respond? Hillary voted for the Iraq war, not me!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 31, 2016Khizr Khan, the bereaved father of fallen soldier Capt. Humayun Khan who attacked Donald Trump last week in a speech at the Democratic National Convention, told CNN s Jim Acosta Sunday morning that terror has  nothing to do with Islam.  Here is Khan s full quote (emphasis added):https://youtu.be/BPwRRUw2XWoIn addition to this, there was in the speech that my good wife asked me to refrain from saying, I wanted to say we reject all violence. We are faithful, patriotic, undivided loyalty to this country. We reject all terrorism. She asked me not to say that because that was not the occasion for such a statement.Well, if you really believed that and you had an audience of millions who were listening to your impassioned pleas, why didn t you just say it? Americans have been begging for Muslims to denounce the violence committed in the name of Islam against innocent Americans. He had the chance, but it was more important that he unfairly bash Trump for holding an opinion about how to best stop terrorism than speak out against radical ISLAM.This Twitter user @socalmike_SD makes a good point:His son was killed by radical Muslims..ppl Trump doesn't want here in the US..How is that shameful? Ridiculous https://t.co/BhaeZPuN99  Michael (@socalmike_SD) July 31, 2016Khan also asked Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Speaker of the House Paul Ryan to  repudiate  Trump, calling it a  moral obligation  and warning that failing to do so would be a  burden on their souls  that history would not forgive.Don t worry Khan. If you re looking for an ally in bringing immigrants to America, you ve found the right guy in Paul Ryan. While you re at it, why don t you ask Ryan how the UN can properly vet immigrants coming from Muslim majority nations who hate us In previous remarks, Trump had acknowledged the positive contributions of most Muslims, while focusing on the need to fight radical Islamic terror. In his speech after the Islamic terror attack on a gay nightclub last month in Orlando, for example, Trump said:  We have Muslim communities in this country that are great, and we have to form that partnership. Last Thursday, Khan caused a sensation at the convention when he spoke alongside his wife, challenging Trump s proposed ban on Muslim immigration, saying:  Have you even read the U.S. Constitution?   You have sacrificed nothing and no one. By the way Khan Trump and his children have received death threats and threats of violence. Trump doesn t have to run for President of the United States. He s doing it because he loves our country. Despite what you and the Democrats would like low-information voters to believe, you don t have the corner on loving America Khan made no mention of radical Islam, or terror. His claim that the Constitution bars Trump s ban on Muslim immigration has also been disputed.Here are a few Muslims views on a temporary Muslim ban in America.

7159, A Federal Judge Just Slapped Down One Of Mississippi’s Most Digustingly Bigoted Laws,"Mississippi has been on a theocratic tear lately. When not giving churches the ability to create  militias for God  with the power to use deadly force and carry firearms, the state s largely conservative legislature has been busy attacking gay rights with something bordering on obsession.Mississippi s state Senate pushed through a vicious anti-gay bill that would:But if that wasn t enough, the bill also reinforced Mississippi s long-standing ban on same-sex couples from adopting children. The insane bigotry on display in Mississippi in the face of current trends towards LGBT rights has led to bizarre work arounds, including social workers asking same-sex couples to live in separate houses for at least six months so they could legally pretend to be single parents *wink wink* and not two loving ones who happen to be gay.A federal judge took one look at the case and concluded that Mississippi was violating a mountain of human rights.Written by U.S. District Judge Daniel Jordan III, the order argued that the state s law barring the adoptions obviously targets married gay couples and limits their rights.  Furthermore, the court argued that the Department of Human Services  policy violates the constitution s equal protection clause as the result of last year s landmark Supreme Court ruling that laws against same-sex marriage are unconstitutional.In short: You can t tell same-sex couples that they can t have children just because you don t happen to like same-sex marriage. It doesn t work that way.The fact of the matter is that Mississippi has absolutely no case   other than unmitigated bigotry   to justify its same-sex adoption ban. Study after study has shown that adopted children in same-sex households do just as well as their counterparts adopted by heterosexual parents. In one major study, researchers discovered that kids raised in same-sex households actually did better.In light of that research, preventing gay couples from adopting isn t just a major screw you to the potential parents, but also to the kids waiting in foster homes. Republican lawmakers may feel comfortable telling gay Mississippians that they aren t allowed to have children, but it takes a particularly heartless person to coldly explain to a child that they can t have a family because a few politicians in the Capitol find same-sex marriage  icky. Thankfully, Judge Jordan s ruling isn t just good news for the people of Mississippi, but have far-reaching implications. As of now, the Department of Human Serves doesn t explicitly protect sexual orientation from adoption discrimination. Jordan called bullshit. According to his ruling, that policy is, in itself, discrimination and should be amended. That would mean Mississippi would be just the first of several Republican states to suddenly have their bigoted adoption policies dismantled.If it stands it means a lot of kids waiting for adoption are about to get some great news.Featured image via Wikipedia ",News,"April 1, 2016"
21539,[UPDATE] THESE 3 COMPANIES Have Demanded Their Names Be Removed From Baby Harvester Planned Parenthood’s List of 40 Major Company Donors,"All of these companies should be ashamed to be contributing to a to a company that kills babies, then shamelessly negotiates for top dollar for their aborted body parts UPDATE:Until this Thursday, Planned Parenthood kept a list of corporate allies and sponsors on its website. Once Coca-Cola became the third corporation to ask to be taken off the list, Planned Parenthood took it down altogether.A snapshot of Planned Parenthood s donation page archived one day ago touts support from very large corporations:The news organization Daily Signal contacted several companies on the list asking about their purported donations to Planned Parenthood in light of videos revealing the organization s harvesting of fetal organs. Representatives from Xerox, Ford, and Coca-Cola deserted the abortion giant, saying they were  incorrectly listed as donors  They said their companies do not contribute to Planned Parenthood and do not match employee gifts to the organization. All three said they have contacted or will contact Planned Parenthood to be removed from its website. There are likely more desertions to come. Pro-life grassroots activists will likely keep calling and asking the remaining corporate giants from the list whether they support the sale of aborted baby parts for medical experimentation. But now that the list is down, the world will not know how many more corporations will ask to be taken off the list of Planned Parenthood supporters.Since the gruesome videos began to appear last week, news has gone from bad to worse for the abortion giant. Two Congressional committees are investigating, along with eight state governments. A bill has been introduced in Congress to withhold Planned Parenthood funding for one year. That would cost the $1.3 billion dollar a year nonprofit corporation $500 million. Via-Breitbart NewsIn the wake of two videos allegedly showing Planned Parenthood officials discussing the sale of aborted fetal body parts, Republicans in Congress are working to ensure that Planned Parenthood is stripped of its federal funding.However, it s not only the government that fills Planned Parenthood s coffers. According to 2nd Vote, a website and app that tracks the flow of money from consumers to political causes, more than 25 percent of Planned Parenthood s $1.3-billion annual revenue comes from private donations, which includes corporate contributions.2nd Vote researched the corporations and organizations to find which supported Planned Parenthood and found that more than three dozen donated to the group. Some companies donated directly, while others matched employee gifts.Forty corporations and organizations directly contribute to the group.Planned Parenthood has come under heavy fire following the release of videos from the Center for Medical Progress.The first video, released last week, showed Planned Parenthood senior executive Dr. Deborah Nucatola meeting with actors portraying buyers from a  human biologics company.  The  buyers  discussed the sale of fetal body parts with Nucatola over lunch.In the second video, Dr. Mary Gatter, president of Planned Parenthood s medical directors council, is seen negotiating the price of aborted fetal body parts.Here are the 40 companies that have directly funded Planned Parenthood.

6654, WATCH: Florida Landscaper SWEARS He Accidentally Mowed Over Trump Sign…Repeatedly (VIDEO),"We hear a lot of talk about making America great again coming from Donald Trump and his massively stupid acolytes   but what about our lawns? Can they be great again? That s what one brave landscaper in Florida apparently decided to find out when he saw a Trump sign in someone s yard. Unfortunately, curiosity can sometimes get the cat banned from working in a neighborhood. It all began with a panicked Facebook post from the sign s Trump-supporting owner: Look at what our landscapers did .. I understand people may not like Trump but I have my rights to put this sign in my yard and it was no accident see for yourself! The video shows a 19-year-old worker riding a mower at high speed directly into Josh Boesch s Donald Trump campaign sign   one of many in the Citrus Chase subdivision resident s yard. He then hops off his mower, appears to throw the sign back in front of the mower, and run it over again. Then, he backs up and appears to run it over again.For those who are concerned, the sign lived through the apparent assault, but Boesch is not happy. The resident told news station WKMG that after noticing his mangled sign, he watched six hours of video to figure out who did the thing in his yard.Boesch says his six-hour investigation into the incident reveals that his lawn had already been mowed, though he admits it could have been an accident   a sentiment echoed by Fred Heldrith, the owner of the landscaping company.Heldreth says his employee did not typically work in the neighborhood, and that he was simply inexperienced with that type of mower.  If he wanted to destroy the sign, he would have destroyed the sign,  he pointed out.  The sign is still there. Indeed, it is still there. But should it have been there in the first place? WKMG reports that Boesch s show of support for Trump was a violation of the Citrus Chase Homeowner s Association guidelines, which prohibit display of campaign signs more than 90 days before an election. Additionally, they report that residents typically remove their signs before landscapers arrive and put them back up later   a courtesy with which the Trump supporter could not be bothered. It s been there for like since January,  Boesch told the station as he explained why he did not do what his neighbors do to make things easier for landscapers,  and it s never been hit by the lawnscapers. They either always mow around it or they use their edger because a lot of them have respect. This, of course, is an ironic statement coming from someone who refuses to show workers the same respect his neighbors do, even forcing them to stop mowing to edge around the campaign signs that have been occupying the space in violation of HOA policies since January.Accident or not, the man responsible for Moweerghazi will not be back. In response to the incident, Citrus Chase assured Boesch: The guy has been removed from the crew, he will not be allowed in our development any more. What do you think? Was this an accident, or was the landscaper simply trying to make Boesch s lawn great again? In any case, the signs are still up and in workers  way. Boesch still refuses to show  respect  to people who simply want to do their jobs without unnecessary hassle.Watch a report on the incident below:Featured image via screengrab ",News,"April 28, 2016"
20956,"NEW “Fair Share” App, “EQUIPAY” Allows Users To Split Restaurant Bill Between Guests, Based On Gender, Sex and Race","A Socialists dream!  Now you can check your privilege at the door. With the Equipay app, you ll never have to walk away from a restaurant with friends wondering if you paid your fair share It s a huge dilemma for progressives: on the one hand, it s terribly patriarchal for a man to pay for a woman s dinner. On the other hand, the gender pay gap of feminist mythology holds that women only make 77 cents for every dollar earned by a man. So isn t the failure to pay just another contribution to structural sexism?Equipay, a new app for Android and the iPhone has a solution. Developed by San Francisco-based  comedian  Luna Malbroux, the app divides bills between dinner guests according to their race and gender. For example, black women, who allegedly make just 64 cents on the dollar compared to white men, would only pay 64 per cent of their share of the bill.According to the app s website,  Equipay helps you avoid the entrenched discrimination that exists in our society. It doesn t split the bill equally it splits it equitably. You pay what you should to balance out the wage gap. The app is free to use   unless you re a member of a  high-privilege group.  Then there s a surcharge. As the site explains:  When dining out with a high privilege group, Equipay automatically adds an EquipayItBack Surcharge. This fee subsidizes meals for others and funds Equipay s charitable arm. Thanks! Last but not least, the app allows users to let their followers know whenever they ve used the app to smash the patriarchy at the dinner table. In a live presentation of the app, Melbroux described how a user,  Graham  shares his Equipay-powered purchase on social media  to show that he is a social justice ally. Of course, having informed the world of his use of Equipay, it remains to be seen if  Graham  will ever be invited out for a meal again.The app won first prize at San Francisco s  Comedy Hack Day,  which brings  comedians, developers, and designers together.  However, Melbroux insists that the app isn t a joke. In an interview with Care2, she expressed hopes that the app would start a serious conversation:  I hope that this, more than anything, starts a discussion and helps people to start thinking a little bit differently about how we can use more technology and more innovation to address inequality and wage inequality. For the rest of us, the app s social media sharing function will give us a useful list of people to never invite out for dinner.  Via:Breitbart",left-news,"Feb 24, 2016"
4024," Trump Sends Out DANGEROUS Tweet Claiming Voter Fraud In Texas, State Voting Officials Call BULLSH!T","Donald Trump has been shouting that the election is rigged against him for weeks. On Thursday morning, the GOP nominee woke up bright and early to post on Twitter that he has been receiving reports of widespread voter fraud taking place in Texas.A lot of call-ins about vote flipping at the voting booths in Texas. People are not happy. BIG lines. What is going on?  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 27, 2016Trump was presumably referring to already debunked reports that the votes of some people trying to vote a straight Republican ticket were being changed to Hillary Clinton, a claim believed to have originated in Tarrant County. However, Snopes reports that this  vote flipping  is due to user error, not a rigged election. Reports are not flooding in from across Texas about vote switching, and most anecdotes are identical with localities changed,  Snopes wrote on Wednesday.Texas officials were also quick to call out Trump s tweet for the load of crap that it was. Frank Phillips, the election administrator for Tarrant County, told WFAA that the claims of  vote flipping  turned out to be bogus, just like every other time there are reports of this nature. Historically, he said, these are cases of user error. Typically, we ve found it s voter error with the equipment,  Phillips said.  Sometimes they vote straight party and then click on other candidates   or do something with the wheel. There is not an issue with the equipment. Election officials have been urging voters to double-check their ballots before turning them in. Earlier this week, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott also urged his constituents to make sure their selections are correct before casting their ballots. Make sure all of your selections are correct before hitting the button to cast a ballot,  Abbott posted on his Facebook page.Trump has ramped up his claims of a rigged election as the election has gotten closer and his poll number have gotten lower. This is not only bullsh*t, it is dangerous and irresponsible. He is sowing seeds of doubt about the very election process that is the foundation of our democracy, all because he can t admit that he is losing.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"October 27, 2016"

We will stop this craziness! @foxandfriends  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 1, 2017Let s keep in mind that this attack happened on Trump s watch. Prior to yesterday s attack, no terrorist had used a vehicle to murder American citizens. Trump promised to keep Americans safe and he promised to wipe out ISIS. He failed.And instead of taking responsibility, Trump decided to blame the top Democrat in the Senate.But Schumer was quick to respond, and he hammered Trump with his own budget, which Republicans are poised to pass.As it turns out, Trump eliminated anti-terrorism funding in his budget and refused to put it back even after the NYPD announced that their anti-terror program would be wiped out by the cut.Schumer wasted no time pointing out Trump s hypocrisy. I have always believed and continue to believe that immigration is good for America. President Trump, instead of politicizing and dividing America, which he always seems to do at times of national tragedy, should be focusing on the real solution   anti-terrorism funding   which he proposed cutting in his most recent budget. I m calling on the President to immediately rescind his proposed cuts to this vital anti-terrorism funding. Basically, Trump would be inviting terrorists to attack the United States by cutting anti-terrorism funding. So instead of worrying about our immigration policies, Americans should be angry about Trump s irresponsible decision to cut funding that helps law enforcement keep us safe.Featured Image: Spencer Platt/Getty Images",News,"November 1, 2017"
5508, Dallas Police Chief Just Completely DESECRATED The ‘Good Guy With A Gun’ Myth (VIDEO),"Dallas Police Chief David Brown just completely desecrated the favorite myth of gun nuts everywhere, that a  good guy with a gun  will heroically save the day when a bad guy starts shooting. We ve all heard it from the NRA and its minions, the delusional fantasy that the only thing that can stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun. Turns out, this is BS and Brown just explained why.Brown was taking questions on Monday following a press conference discussing the vicious attack that left five police officers dead on Thursday. He was asked about the open carry laws in Texas. We know that there was at least one gentleman who was a subject   person of interest, during the demonstration he had an AR-15 around his   around his shoulder,  he was asked.  What does this tell you about people using the new Texas law of open carry at a demonstration like this? After finding out that the person asking the question was indeed local, Brown explained the position law enforcement finds themselves in as a result of open carry laws put in place by lawmakers who are in the pocket of the NRA. In the process, he completely laid waste to the myth of a  good guy with a gun  saving the day. All right, so, it s a little different here in Texas in the way we view open carry, concealed carry. We ve had great dialogue with our state legislators about this. We ve expressed all of our concerns. We are trying as best as we can as a law enforcement community to make it work so the citizens can express their Second Amendment rights.But it s increasingly challenging when people have AR-15s slung over and shootings occur in a crowd and they begin running, and we don t know   or we don t know if they re the shooter or not, or they begin, it s been the presumption that a good guy with a gun is the best way to resolve some of these things. Well, we don t know who the good guy is versus who the bad guy is if everybody starts shooting, and we ve expressed that concern as well. Brown concluded by saying that he hopes lawmakers will listen to input from law enforcement when in comes to gun laws. I have every belief and trust that our folks are listening at the state on this issue, particularly as it involves protests,  said the chief.He also noted that time after time, congress offers  thoughts and prayers  when mass shootings take place, yet they do nothing to take any meaningful steps towards preventing tragedies like this from occurring.

1211, Anything Can Provoke Trump To Block You On Twitter – Even Ice Cream!,"I guess Trump missed the sticks and stones lesson in life as more and more of his critics are getting blocked on Twitter over the tiniest things.Take, for example, Rob Szczerba s covfefe ice cream joke. According to CNN, Szczerba tweeted Trump:  @realDonaldTrump I heard #covfefe is a new flavor from Ben & Jerry s. But it s mostly just nuts! I heard #covfefe is a new flavor from Ben & Jerry's. But it's mostly just nuts! #ParisAgreement #ParisAccord  Rob Szczerba (@RJSzczerba) June 2, 2017When Szczerba went to tweet Trump again not long after, he found himself blocked by Trump.How sad is that? Blocked because of a joke. Rather than laugh off his own typo, Trump would rather pout and block people.Lauren Wolfe believes that blocking critics poses dangerous implications. When Trump shuts out his critics, he withdraws further into the bubble of sycophancy he already enjoys,  Wolfe wrote in an opinion piece for CNN.Wolfe raises a valid point. As the old saying goes: if you can t handle the heat, get out of the kitchen. So, what is Trump doing in the kitchen?Since Trump shows no signs of stopping as the number of people he blocks on Twitter grows, questions and concerns are on the rise. While some wear their blocked status proudly and couldn t care less, it raises first amendment concerns.If tweets by Trump, no matter how ridiculous they are, should they be inaccessible to certain people? After all, his tweets are meant to be treated as official White House statements.The Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University says a lawsuit is not out of the question if Trump doesn t unblock Twitter users. Your Twitter account is a designated public forum for essentially the same reasons that open city council meetings and school board meetings are,  the lawyers wrote in the letter.A fair point. Nobody deserves or should be exempt from what the president has to say on social media. Trump is no longer a private citizen and his Twitter account is also no longer personal to hide from others.While hilariously sad that Trump s blocking people, it just reinforces that everything is Trump s way or the highway.Featured image via Pete Marovich/Bloomberg via Getty Images",News,"June 9, 2017"

5753, Trump Fan Running For Congress Says He Will ‘Make America White Again’,"For those who think Donald Trump isn t bringing horrible racism out from the depths of the right-wing s closet, there s Rick Tyler, an independent candidate running for office in Tennessee s third Congressional district. He s so worried about the  browning  of America that he s actually running his campaign on taking us back to the 1960s, when there were fewer problems, by making America white again.Yes, that s literally what he wants. He even had campaign billboards put up that said,  Make America White Again,  around Benton, Tenn. Tyler claims that he s got no hatred for people of color. He just wants America to go back to a  1960s, Ozzie and Harriet, Leave it to Beaver time when there were no break-ins; no violent crime; no mass immigration. Right, there s totally no racism there. We re sure some of his best friends are people of color, too. He thinks that white people are the architects of advanced society, so elevating white people is the best way to  make America great again. He also had a billboard up that was a picture of the White House ringed with Confederate flags, which said,  I have a dream.  For someone who allegedly isn t racist, he certainly enjoys racist sayings and symbols, and implying that people who aren t white are responsible for all our ills today.To co-opt one of the most famous messages from one of the most famous civil rights leaders in American history for his racist agenda is just vile.How does Trump fit into this, besides his rampant, blatant racism? Tyler wrote the following on his website: [T]he Trump phenomenon has and will continue to produce spin off effects and fall out that can be beneficially seized upon by the elect remnant of the God of Scriptures. In our present political season the dominant presence of Donald Trump has served to open us channels of discourse and dialogue that have previously been off limits. His advocacy of a  temporary ban  on Muslim immigration and the construction of a wall on the Southern border have created a climate conducive to conversation relative to the elephant in the living room no one wants to talk about namely, the urgent and vital subject of race. There it is, the hatred and fear of  political correctness  that pervades the thinking of these racists. They believe it s not racist at all to say that race plays a role in America s downfall, and imply that whites are the only race capable of restoring us to our former glory. Nope. It s just  telling it like it is,  and Tyler seems to have embraced that Trumpian mentality wholeheartedly.The signs have been taken down, but Tyler didn t do it. He wants them back up, saying he paid for them to be up through November s election: If I could I d have hundreds of these billboards up across the 3rd District. That would go over just as well as his initial billboards did. Tyler is delusional though. He believes that his signs do reflect the feelings of a majority of people, despite the people from Tennessee s third district calling into WCRB-TV to say that their county does not, in fact, feel this way. The billboards were likely removed because those people Tyler thinks are so supportive of his views were actually upset.Featured image via screen capture from WRCB report",News,"June 24, 2016"
7103, Trump Fan Scott Baio Proves How Dumb He Truly Is With Moronic Global Warming Tweet,"There are a lot of things people can forgive in life, but utter stupidity for lack of even remotely trying to comprehend a subject isn t one of those things. When information is readily available to learn about something, but you simply ignore the reality of that information to go with your own moronic viewpoint because it makes more sense to you, well, you deserve to be ridiculed.Global Warming, or rather Climate Change, is very real, and there are unending facts to prove it. Yet, there are still those who choose to ignore 97% of scientists, decades of research, and a quite visible increase in abnormal weather patterns. One of those people is Donald Trump supporter Scott Baio. The Happy Days star may have literally just put one of the most moronic tweets to ever exist up on his feed Sunday night.He said: Dear Global Warming, Funny, I spent 4 days in Palm Desert playing golf, getting a tan while looking at the snow on the mountains.

Yes, when it s hot in the dry California valleys and deserts it can still be cold in the mountain regions which get more moisture and are much higher in altitude, yet still visible from the valleys and deserts.Rarely would I dub someone so clearly and utterly moronic, but this seems to be well worthy of the condemnation.

In a move that will surprise no one ever, Trump flew into a rage and fired her.

In a scathing statement issued by White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, Yates was basically branded a traitor. The statement accused her of having  betrayed  the DOJ and described her as an  Obama Administration appointee who is weak on borders and very weak on immigration. Tonight,  the statement read,  President Trump has relieved Ms. Yates of her duties. Instantly, people began referring to Yates  firing as the  Monday Night Massacre.  This is a reference to when Richard Nixon ordered a special prosecutor be fired for refusing to stop looking into the Watergate scandal. As a result, two of the DOJ s top leaders resigned rather obey the shameful order.

219, Satanists Brilliantly Troll Anti-Gay Baker By Requesting A Birthday Cake For Lucifer (VIDEO),"Christian cake baker Jack Phillips gained national infamy when he violated Colorado s non-discrimination law by refusing to bake a cake for a gay couple s wedding. He was subsequently sued, and now his case is headed to the Supreme Court. Unfortunately, with the current makeup of the court and Donald Trump s administration in place, it is quite likely that discrimination will be codified into law. Nonetheless, The Satanic Temple has come up with a brilliant way to point out that religious freedom cuts both ways: By having these bigoted bakers make cakes for Satan.Jack Phillips has already had his first request via email from a Satanist seeking to celebrate Satan. It reads:Dear Mr PhillipsI would like to get a quote on a birthday cake, for a special event. It is a cake that is religious in theme, and since religion is a protected class, I am hoping that you will gladly bake this cake. As you see the birthday cake in question is to celebrate the birthday of Lucifer, or as they are also known Satan who was born as Satan when he was cast from heaven by God. The cake only needs to be a simple 9 13 single layer cake, with red and black icing. As well as to contain an upside down cross, under the head of Lucifer. And I thought I would seek you out, to bake this cake since you appear to be a very moral person since you refused to bake a cake for same sex couples. And since religion is a protected class, I hope you will be willing to bake this cake, so my small group of religious friends can celebrate the birthday of Lucifer this coming November, just a few days after Halloween.Sincerely,(Name redacted)Here is a sample cake posted to Twitter by The Satanic Temple s co-founder, Lucien Greaves:Did you know: bakers can't refuse service to The Satanic Temple because religion is a ""protected class""? #SatanCakes pic.twitter.com/9VrVndkbSi  Lucien Greaves (@LucienGreaves) September 26, 2017The whole point here is not to torment bakers or anyone else. It is to point out that if you own a business that is open to the public, you may not discriminate, period. Now, at the federal level there are no non-discrimination protections for LGBTQ people. However, religion   EVERY religion   is a protected class. If Jack Phillips or anyone else refuses the Satanists their cakes, this will be an open and shut court case.Mr. Phillips, it would have been a hell of a lot easier if you had just baked the damn wedding cake.Here is video of the Temple s co-founder explaining his position:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"October 15, 2017"

19905,BOOM! SMUG NEWSPAPER EDITORS Endorse Hillary…Phone Lines Blow Up With Subscription CANCELLATIONS,"Smug liberal newspapers and tv networks have paid a heavy price  for their criticism of Trump. Americans think of Trump as the underdog in this race and there s nothing worse than piling on the underdog. For these liberal hacks who have been writing their leftist opinions as opposed to real news for decades, they re about to find out what it means to be considered irrelevant by their former readers The subscription cancellations were coming every 10 minutes. Angry readers have been calling in droves. We re feeling the weight of our history,  Phil Boas, the editorial page editor of The Arizona Republic, said in a telephone interview on Wednesday. Until it endorsed Hillary Clinton on Tuesday, the newspaper, founded in 1890, had never endorsed a Democrat over a Republican for president.In endorsing Mrs. Clinton, The Republic s editorial was, by any interpretation, scathing toward her opponent, Donald J. Trump.  Trump responds to criticism with the petulance of verbal spit wads,  the editorial says at one point.  That s beneath our national dignity. The papers lay out different reasons for supporting Mrs. Clinton over Mr. Trump   his lack of political experience versus her established political career, his outbursts and insults versus her steadiness   and some are perhaps more repudiations of Mr. Trump than glowing endorsements of Mrs. Clinton, whose faults are also cited.For some readers, however, the endorsements proved a step too far.  Certainly, we ve paid a price for our presidential recommendation,  Mike Wilson, the editor of The Dallas Morning News, told Poynter this month.Mr. Boas of The Arizona Republic said he expected  a lot of cancellations,  pointing to cancellations at The Cincinnati Enquirer, which like The Republic, is owned by Gannett.But he said financial considerations were  never a factor  for the newspaper s nine-person editorial board.  It was more of a curiosity,  he said.  We know we re doing the right thing. We feel very good about this decision.

5181, Donald Trump’s Hispanic Outreach Effort Humiliatingly Goes Down In Flames,"The Republican Party should be prepared to lose the Hispanic vote by a record number this year as Donald Trump has basically just surrendered any chance the party had to reach out to them.After 71 percent of Hispanics voted to re-elect President Obama in 2012, Republicans claimed that they would work hard to bring them back into the fold to better their chances in 2016. Since then, however, the Republican Party has only doubled down on their anti-immigration stance and they chose Trump to be their nominee.Trump s poll numbers among Hispanics have since gone from bad to downright atrocious even as he scrambles to do ridiculous outreach efforts like eating a taco bowl or having white Trump supporters hold up signs saying Latinos support Trump to somehow draw Hispanic support to his campaign. And it looks like any substantial effort has just gone down the toilet as well.According to Buzzfeed, cancellations of outreach events and frustration among Hispanic volunteers and surrogates is imploding Trump s pitiful attempt to attract Hispanic support.RNC Chair Reince Priebus bragged prior to the Republican Convention that Trump  is going to be doing a Hispanic engagement tour coming up soon  and claimed Trump  understands  the need to expand the party in the general election.That apparently went in one ear and out the other as Trump has failed to meet with Hispanic leaders in Texas and Florida, which is only angering the few Republican Hispanic voters left.The campaign canceled an initial July 8 roundtable with Cuban business and faith leaders in Miami because of the tragic shooting in Dallas. Then the rescheduled July 26 event was officially canceled because the roundtable participants were out of town. (Three Republican sources told BuzzFeed News a hold was put on the campaign calendar for that time slot but the event was never planned.)Another unreported, but planned Hispanic event was also canceled: The July 5 event was supposed to bring Trump face-to-face with San Antonio business leaders and Texas Republicans, but after the campaign reached out for venue space and possible participants, the event was scrapped. I think they couldn t get enough people to come to the event because their support among Hispanic voters is 14%,  Republican voter Artemio Muniz said.  What do they expect? Indeed, Trump s is polling so badly among Hispanics that Hillary Clinton is currently leading him in all 12 swing states, including Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Michigan, North Carolina, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wisconsin.Furthermore, 67 percent of Hispanic voters support Hillary Clinton while only 19 percent support Trump   77 percent of Hispanics view Trump unfavorably.Trump s performance among Hispanic voters in November would be even worse than Mitt Romney in 2012 if the current numbers hold. Romney was able to capture 27 percent in 2012. Trump is 8 points behind that mark and it may only get worse from there as he continues disparaging Hispanics wherever he goes and continues to fail at getting any outreach effort off the ground.It also doesn t help that Trump s campaign has rejected the effort of Ileana Garcia, who started Latinas For Trump, to lead a national effort to attract Hispanic voters. The Trump campaign got mad at her for telling reporters in Cleveland that she is the national Latino spokesperson for Trump. Now it appears she will not have a major role within the campaign at all even though Trump and the GOP desperately need someone to do something to stop the bleeding.At this point, it s very late in the game to convince Hispanic voters that Trump is somehow the right person to be president. He has made zero effort to reverse the damage he has done and only continues to do more damage. If Republican leadership didn t have buyer s remorse before, they certainly do now because it really looks like the only demographic Trump is courting is the white vote and that may have been enough to win 30 years ago, but it definitely is not enough today.Featured image via Twitter",News,"August 4, 2016"
19714,BREAKING BOMBSHELL: WEINER IS COOPERATING…FBI Didn’t Need Warrant…NOT Good News For Crooked Hillary [VIDEO],"One can only imagine what kind of relationship Hillary has with her very close top aide s soon to be ex-husband Fox News Sunday reported this morning that Anthony Weiner is cooperating with the FBI, which has re-opened (yes, lefties:  re-opened ) the investigation into Hillary Clinton s classified emails. Watch as Chris Wallace reports the breaking news during the panel segment near the end of the show:https://youtu.be/x13hBwS9q2cAnd the news is breaking while we re on the air. Our colleague Bret Baier has just sent us an e-mail saying he has two sources who say that Anthony Weiner, who also had co-ownership of that laptop with his estranged wife Huma Abedin, is cooperating with the FBI investigation, had given them the laptop, so therefore they didn t need a warrant to get in to see the contents of said laptop. Pretty interesting development. Targets of federal investigations will often cooperate, hoping that they will get consideration from a judge at sentencing. Given Weiner s well-known penchant for lying, it s hard to believe that a prosecutor would give Weiner a deal based on an agreement to testify, unless his testimony were very strongly corroborated by hard evidence. But cooperation can take many forms   and, as Wallace indicated on this morning s show, one of those forms could be signing a consent form to allow investigators to review the contents of devices that they could probably get a warrant for anyway. We ll see if Weiner s cooperation extends beyond that.Via: Red State",left-news,"Oct 30, 2016"
19542,"GERMANY’S Anti-Trump, Open Borders ANGELA MERKEL Sees Re-election Poll Numbers Drop…Orders 100,000 Migrants To Be Deported…By Force If Necessary","In what has to be considered an historic about face, German Chancellor Angela Merkel announced that 100,000 migrants who recently arrived in Germany would be deported.For more than a year following the massive tide of humanity that flooded into Germany from Africa and the Middle East, Merkel stoutly defended her open border policy as being consistent with western values. A million migrants later, and a huge voter backlash due to overburdened local governments and a sky rocketing crime rate, Merkel has changed her tune.On November 9, 2016, Germany s Angela Merkel offered Donald J. Trump a public admonishment following his historic win against pro-amensty Hillary Clinton: Sunday Express:Ordinarily, a politician who tried to pull this off would be toast. But Merkel finds herself in a strong position because the alternatives to her are even worse.Recent polls show her coalition of the CDU/CSU comfortably ahead by 11 points over the Social Democratic Party   the leading left wing party in Germany   by 33-22%. The next strongest party are the Greens who poll at 12% and then the nationalist party AfD at almost 9%. Put simply, the German voter has nowhere else to go now that Merkel has flip flopped on immigration.There is a chance that the left wing parties will poll enough votes to fashion a majority, but given that the Social Democrats are determined to continue with a liberal immigration policy, it isn t likely.Merkel will probably pull off her switcheroo on open borders and win re-election.

7372, You’re Not Going To Believe What Trump Just Stopped A Press Conference For (VIDEO),"Republican front runner Donald Trump has stopped events for strange reasons before   let s not forget that the business mogul once hijacked and paused an entire GOP debate, just so that he could assure America that there was  no problem with the size of his penis. He s at it again, and this time is just as bizarre.CNN had wisely decided to cover President Barack Obama s press conference with Raul Castro instead of Trump s address to the press after his meeting with Republicans in DC, but when the network turned back to Trump s press conference things got really weird. While taking questions from the audience at the construction site of the Trump International Hotel, the candidate decided to stop the show and give a woman a job interview on the spot while cameras were rolling and everyone else awkwardly looked on.The woman identified herself as a 9/11 survivor and an Iraq and Afghanistan War veteran, telling Trump: I love the policy that you have for the military. I wanted to know if Trump towers would be part of the veterans job  Trump cut the woman off and said, What are you talking about here? We are doing some of that actually already. We have it very much involved. Why what are you looking for? What kind of a position? Then Trump invited her to  come up here  on stage with him.As the woman joined him, Trump asked the crowd gathered at his soon-to-be hotel,  Do you mind if I do a job interview right now? We need good people. For this  job interview , Trump instructed the woman to tell everyone about about her experience with design and decorating. In those few seconds, Trump decided that she would be a great employee and passed her off to  the men  in charge of the building, saying that if they could negotiate a great deal on her salary, she would probably have a job in no time.You can watch this strange, impromptu interview below:WATCH: Donald Trump conducts impromptu job interview during press conference.https://t.co/KNb43kll8c  CSPAN (@cspan) March 21, 2016The interview was so weird and uncomfortable to watch, Trump got grilled by the next reporter he chose to take questions from.

6619, Man Caught Peeping On Little Boy In Airport Bathroom – But GOP Worries Ladies Might Have A Penis,"According to Republicans, it is imperative that we  protect women and children  by instituting measures that punish transgender women for having a penis. Some measures would literally place a bounty on transgender people, financially rewarding anyone who spots a penis in the women s restroom. Others would impose heavy fines on transgender people simply for going to the correct bathroom. These measures, which combat alleged threats which have absolutely no basis in reality, have been decried nationwide by thinking individuals who realize that Republicans   the very people imposing these harsh and pathetic laws on the rest of us   are a greater danger to women and children than transgender people could ever be.While Republicans crow about their attempts to save woman and childkind from the evil penises that may or may not be attached to women whose primary goal in a bathroom is to relieve themselves, they ignore certain inconvenient truths   like that children face greater danger from straight men in the men s restroom. On April 22, a traveler at a Seattle airport noticed something horrifying: a man was snapping pictures of his 8-year-old son in the bathroom.According to charging papers, the little boy was using the bathroom when North Carolina resident (yes, he s from the same state that recently shamed the nation by  protecting  children from transgender women with its asinine  bathroom bill ) stood in the neighboring stall and began taking photos over the stall wall. The boy s father spotted the man performing this disgusting act and rushed to stop him. Are you taking pictures of my son?  the man demanded angrily. Joshua Gitlin denied it, but the father saw a photo of his son still on the pervert s cell phone screen. He grabbed Gitlin s phone and slammed the stall closed as others called for police assistance. Gitlin was arrested  at the scene. Police confiscated his phone and other electronic devices with which Gitlin was traveling. He was jailed and charged with voyeurism, but was released Saturday on $100,000 bond.To date, there have been zero instances of transgender people being arrested for bathroom misconduct, but the same can not be said for Republican lawmakers. Unfortunately, transgender people don t write the laws.In November, be sure to head to the polls and vote BLUE so we can end this absurdity and begin focusing on real, important issues   like undoing the damage Republicans are inflicting on our nation.Featured image via Afflictor",News,"April 30, 2016"

11814,BOOM! Indiana YMCA Takes CNN Off TV’s After Members Complain About “Fake News”,"The term  fake news  has become attached to some of America s major news outlets. Now a YMCA in Valparaiso, Ind., has decided to ban CNN from its TVs after customers complained the news network falsifies stories. In order to eliminate perceived political bias associated with national news outlets, the Valparaiso Family YMCA will only be showing local news channels in the future,  the Valparaiso YMCA said in a statement.Chicago Tribune reporter/columnist Jerry Davich said he asked Valparaiso YMCA CEO Robert Wanek to elaborate on why the decision was made, and Wanek responded,  I cannot pinpoint the change origins, only to add that we get dozens of requests to change channels every day from numerous interest groups. We just want the Y to be a haven for wellness where people come together and have a sense of belonging, gain new relationships and achieve their personal goals,  Wanek added.  We will display local news moving forward. Davich complained that  the Y s decision to remove all national news outlets from its televisions says more about its leaders than its members. You d think this story would be just another example of fake news. Sadly, it s not. He said he wondered if the company was  simply exercising its right to appease as many members as possible, or is the new Donald Trump-led America already flexing its muscles? YMCA member Greg Quartucci told CBS Chicago the decision to remove CNN from wellness center TVs was made shortly after Trump confronted CNN White House correspondent Jim Acosta, calling his network  terrible  and  fake news.

18536,WOW! NEW Batch Of Emails Show Hillary’s State Department Was “CORRUPTION CENTRAL” For Obama Regime…Reveals Favors Huma Did For Clinton Foundation Insiders,"A nonprofit legal watchdog claimed Thursday that newly unearthed documents show Hillary Clinton sent and received more classified information on her private server than previously known, and that the papers also show top aide Huma Abedin did favors for Clinton Foundation insiders.Judicial Watch released more than 2,000 pages of documents it obtained pursuant to a May 5, 2015 court order, after filing a lawsuit against the State Department for failing to comply with a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request.The new documents included 115 Clinton email exchanges that were not previously turned over by the State Department.According to Judicial watch, on Dec. 6, 2010, Clinton shared classified information with non-U.S. government employees Justin Cooper, an aide to former President Clinton, and Clinton Foundation Director Doug Band. The email allegedly shows Clinton instructing her aide to print the correspondence, which involved allegations of theft by Bangladeshi banker and Clinton Foundation donor Muhammad Yunus.Yunus was accused of embezzling $100 million from the Grameen Bank, which he founded.Judicial Watch s new emails appear to show multiple Abedin email exchanges from an unsecured server. They also appear to show that Clinton s then-scheduler, Lona Valmoro, forwarded Clinton s daily Secretary of State schedule to top Clinton Foundation officials, along with a  number of favors  that were requested.In a May 10, 2010 email between Abedin and Band, Abedin said she  hooked up  people from the Russian American Foundation with the  right people  at the State Department. The Russia-American Foundation was then staffed by Clinton political supporters, according to Judicial Watch.Additional documents allegedly show that Chelsea Clinton emails, an email sent by Clinton to Abedin saying she did not wish to fly on the same plane with former First Lady Michelle Obama to Betty Ford s funeral, and an email chain between Clinton staffers showing they drafted a  doctors statement  as to why Mrs. Clinton fainted due to  dehydration  causing her to hit her head and suffer a  concussion  in December 2012. Judicial Watch s email shows that the same group, including Cheryl Mills, Huma Abedin, Jake Sullivan and Philippe Reines, prepared a discharge statement when she was released from the hospital.

5998, NRA’s Response To The Florida Shooting Spree That Left 3 Dead Speaks Volumes,"On Sunday, while Floridians braced themselves for Tropical Storm Colin, a gunman decided to Second Amendment two innocent people to death in Cape Coral. According to authorities, the first shooting occurred at about 5:45 p.m. when a gunman killed a motorcyclist at a busy intersection. The suspect then drove to a Circle K gas station where he shot two people, killing one of them. Shortly after the second shooting, police spotted the murderer s car, stopped it and confronted him. The police say that the suspect  violently resist[ed] officers  and he was killed after firing at officers. Two people were found with gunshot wounds in his car, but police have not determined if they were shot by officers or the gunman.Basically, Sunday was another violent day in America. Of course, the biggest pro-gun group, the National Rifle Association, spoke out right away and condemned the shootings. They demanded to know who this shooter was and how he got a gun. They spoke out against Florida s lax laws that allow nearly everyone to buy a weapon. They demanded action and said they want to stop this from happening ever again because dammit! this is America and people should be able to drive down the road or buy a candy bar without being gunned down.Just kidding. The NRA did no such thing; instead, they responded with silence. As usual.Two innocent people are dead and the biggest gun group in the country completely ignored it. They pretended that it didn t even happen because they don t give a shit about the lives and safety of the citizens they claim to protect. They do not care that a man was riding his motorcycle on a Sunday evening and never made it home thanks to some gun nut. They do not care about the two people in the Circle K who were shot and the one who passed away from their injuries. They do not care about the thousands of other mothers, fathers, grandparents, aunts, uncles and CHILDREN who are killed every single year in this country.Instead of issuing a statement of remorse and sympathy to the loved ones of the victims, the NRA used their time to attack Hillary Clinton and journalist Katie Couric on Twitter.Oh look: @HillaryClinton won t say if the #2A guarantees an individual right https://t.co/n84mk7pJjm  NRA (@NRA) June 6, 2016 There s still time to sign up, but the clock is ticking! https://t.co/CUDLrWHQ1N#firekatie#UndertheGunpic.twitter.com/Fp7mcvfugq  NRA (@NRA) June 6, 2016That was more important than acknowledging the loss of life in Florida and it speaks volumes about their real priorities.

22407,"PARTNERS IN CRIME: Goldman Sachs, The Clintons & Wall Street","Shawn Helton 21st Century WireThe cozy relationship between Goldman Sachs and the Clintons has reached dizzying new heights in recent years, giving the Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton an immensely influential partner on Wall Street.As the public and most of the mainstream media is still processing the political bombshell concerning the newly reopened FBI probe into the Hillary Clinton s email server case   the global investment banking firm Goldman Sachs quietly endorsed the Democratic presidential candidate this past week.The financial ties that bind the Clintons and Wall Street banks like Goldman Sachs are nothing new, but never before have the connections been so exposed. Let s take a trip down collusion lane to review some of the more questionable examples of their political and financial merger formed long ago   MONEY CHANGERS    Wall Street s Goldman Sachs are inextricably linked to the Clinton s and The Clinton Foundation. (Photo illustration 21WIRE)The Clintons & Goldman Sachs While campaigning for his first term in the White House, former president Bill Clinton received an enormous amount of support from Washington insider lobbyists and investment banking firms on Wall Street.At the top of the pile sat Goldman Sachs In 1992, the LA Times reported that presidential nominee Bill Clinton, received the largest share of his financial support at least $2.6 million from lawyers and lobbyists,  and that Clinton also received additional support from big securities firms such as Goldman, Sachs & Co. in New York and Stephens Inc. in his hometown of Little Rock, Ark. In fact, Goldman Sachs employees and their family members were responsible for the biggest contributions from a single firm: $98,700. For decades the Clintons have remained close allies to the banking behemoth Goldman Sachs and in the process, a mutually beneficial relationship has taken hold, something that even the NY Times admits: Over 20-plus years, Goldman provided the Clintons with some of their most influential advisers, millions of dollars in campaign contributions and speaking fees, and financial support for the family foundation s charitable programs. By now, there should be little doubt that the Clinton political machine is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Wall Street banking cartel. Their relationship was built over three decades.The real watershed moment came here  BLANK CHECK: Bill Clinton laughs with Wall Street elites after signing the Financial Services Modernization Act in 1999. Key to the Kingdom In one of the most significant financial rulings in the modern era, the Clinton presidency gave big banks like Goldman Sachs the skeleton key to the kingdom by deregulating the investment banking system almost entirely.The Clinton/Goldman Sachs/Wall Street partnership was fully forged after the removal of the Glass-Steagall Act, which banking luminaries cynically named the  Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999  officially titled the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.  The original Glass-Steagall was a depression-age four-part provision under the Bank Act of 1933 that strictly prohibited securities activities that could be harmful to investors   the same sort of rogue speculating and paper fiat fraud which triggered the Great Depression (1929-1941). In fact, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act which repealed Glass-Steagall, opened the door for the  shadow banking  realm outside of regulatory oversight which led to a much higher trading risk, as banks became more interlinked.Simply put: Clinton s repeal of Glass-Steagell removed the firewall between speculative investment banking and regular high street retail and consumer banking   which exposed everyone to toxic, subprime ponzi schemes and fake paper products being pushed around the globe by the banking elite   which ultimately caused the global economy to crash in 2008. All that can be laid at the feet of one William Jefferson Clinton. And Hillary still claims that,  My husband did so well with the economy.  Really?In a cross-posted article featured at Huffington Post, Nomi Prins underscored the complicit nature of Wall Street and Washington after the removal of tighter bank regulations under the Clinton administration during the 1990 s: To grasp the dangers that the Big Six banks (JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley) presently pose to the financial stability of our nation and the world, you need to understand their history in Washington, starting with the Clinton years of the 1990s. Alliances established then (not exclusively with Democrats, since bankers are bipartisan by nature) enabled these firms to become as politically powerful as they are today and to exert that power over an unprecedented amount of capital. Rest assured of one thing: their past and present CEOs will prove as critical in backing a Hillary Clinton presidency as they were in enabling her husband s years in office. Prins herself was a former managing director at Goldman Sachs, senior managing director at Bear Stearns, as well as having worked as a senior strategist at the now defunct investment banking firm Lehman Brothers. Following the financial crash in 2007-2008, Prins blew the whistle on the banking world in a book entitled  It Takes a Pillage: Behind the Bonuses, Bailouts, and Backroom Deals from Washington to Wall Street.  Prins has become an advocate for the reinstatement of the Glass-Steagall Act since departing from the investment banking world.The media outlet Common Dreams described the merger between Citicorp and Travelers Group (becoming Citigroup), which was dubbed the  Citi-Travelers Act  on Capitol Hill. It was a conglomeration that went hand in hand with the Clinton administration s influence on banking deregulation marked by the repeal of Glass-Steagall: Then, in 1998, in an act of corporate civil disobedience, Citicorp and Travelers Group announced they were merging. Such a combination of banking and insurance companies was illegal under the Bank Holding Company Act, but was excused due to a loophole that provided a two-year review period of proposed mergers. The merger was premised on the expectation that Glass-Steagall would be repealed. Citigroup s co-chairs Sandy Weill and John Reed led a swarm of industry executives and lobbyists who trammeled the halls of Congress to make sure a deal was cut. At the time, it was the largest financial merger even though it was technically illegal, as stated by the former Bankers of America CEO Kenneth Guenther. In 1999, after 12 attempts in 25 years,  Congress passed the Financial Services Modernization Act, which led to the repeal of Glass-Steagall.The repeal of Glass-Steagall was pushed heavily by Citigroup s co-CEO Sanford Weill and lobbyist Roger Levy and according to a report by The Nation: They laid out more than $290 million for lobbying in 1998, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, and donated more than $150 million in the 1997 98 election cycle a figure sure to be topped in 1999 2000. How much of those contributions made their way to the Clinton family and what kind of impact did this have after they left the White House?In 2005, Bill Clinton was paid over half a million for speaking at three private Goldman events.In 2013, after stepping down from her position as Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton gave a total of three paid speeches at Goldman Sachs events to the tune of $675,000 dollars, in which one attendee said she sounded more like a Goldman Sachs managing director,  according to a quote obtained by Politico. Indeed, Clinton gave a glowing speech to the Goldman gang and in the process, as Wikileaks released in early October, the Democratic nominee believes in  both a public and a private position  on Wall Street reform and that it is an  oversimplification  to suggest that investment banking led to the most recent financial crisis.That Clinton leak provided another window into the much protected alliance between finance and politics, but it s only the tip of a much larger iceberg.In 2015, the Washington Post reported that  Hillary Rodham Clinton and former president Bill Clinton earned in excess of $25 million for delivering 104 speeches since the beginning of 2014, a huge infusion to their net worth as she was readying for a presidential bid.   ANOINTED : Chelsea Clinton with Goldman Sachs-backed hedge funder Marc Mezvinsky.The Clinton family is chock-full of banking connections, as Chelsea Clinton  joined the Avenue Capital Group, which according to reports is a $12 billion hedge fund whose founder has contributed to many Democratic Party campaigns.  Chelsea is married to Marc Mezvinsky, a former investment banker for Goldman Sachs. Chelsea s tenure at Avenue Capital Group was from 2006-2008 just prior to Hillary Clinton s run for president in 2008. Since then Chelsea has risen to vice chairman inside the Clinton Foundation.Marc Mezvinsky was forced to close one of his hedge funds recently, Eaglevale Hellenic Opportunity, after had the fund lost most of its initial investor funds of $25 million   after blowing the money on secondhand junk Greek bank stocks and toxic government debt.The apple doesn t fall far from the tree  As it turns out, Marc is the son of troubled former Congressman Ed Mezvinsky   another close friend of Team Clinton.Politico reports on one of Ed Mezvinsky s financial controversies in 1999:  In the waning days of Clinton s presidency, federal prosecutors and the FBI were bearing down on former Rep. Ed Mezvinsky (D-Iowa), who had fallen for a series of Ponzi schemes and pulled in nearly $10 million money from other investors to cover his losses. Continuing, Politico outlined new information concerning a pardon request sent by from Ed Mezvinsky s wife to then President Bill Clinton: records released last week by the Clinton Presidential Library in Little Rock and obtained by POLITICO show Mezvinsky and his then-wife   ex-Rep. Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky (D-Pa.)   pleaded with the former president for a presidential pardon to head off the looming federal case. In 2016, the Daily Mail reported the following: Chelsea Clinton s husband and his partners have suffered a huge loss after trying to bet on the revival of the Greek economy, and are now being forced to shut down one of their hedge funds.Marc Mezvinsky, 38, and his partners, former Goldman Sachs colleagues Bennett Grau and Mark Mallon, raised $25million from investors to buy up bank stocks and debt from the struggling nation.That fund however has lost 90 percent of its value, investors with direct knowledge of the situation told The New York Times, and will now be closed.

(Image Source: ilovemyfreedom)The NY Times further outlined the long-held Clinton/Goldman connection just two years before the 2007-2008 financial crisis: The Clintons  relationships with Wall Street deepened in the 2000s, when Mr. Clinton set up his foundation in Harlem and Mrs. Clinton was elected to the Senate from New York. That brought her in close touch with the big Wall Street firms, a source of jobs and tax revenue for New York   and a leading source of campaign funds for Mrs. Clinton. During her years in Congress, employees of Goldman donated in excess of $234,000 to Mrs. Clinton, more than those of any other company except Citigroup, accordingto the Center for Responsive Politics.Along with other New York politicians, Mrs. Clinton worked to obtain federal tax breaks to resuscitate Lower Manhattan after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, and those breaks helped Goldman build its new, roughly $2 billion headquarters. When it broke ground in 2005, Mrs. Clinton and other New York officials were on-site. HOW TO MONETIZE INFLUENCE    Lloyd Blankfein at a Clinton Global Initiative event with Hillary Clinton. (Image Source: sputniknews)The Wall Street RacketTo understand who powers the Clinton Foundation s billion dollar RICO influence-peddling slush fund, you need to understand how money is laundered between Wall Street and Washington DC.Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America and Citigroup and many others were all ordered to pay millions for misleading investors after the 2008 crash, then in April of 2016, Goldman was ordered to settle a federal and state probe for $5 Billion dollars. CNBC reported the following: Goldman Sachs will pay $5 billion to settle federal and state probes into the bank s sale of mortgage-backed securities before the financial crisis, the Justice Department announced Monday.Authorities said Goldman misrepresented the quality of loans it securitized and then sold to investors ahead of the housing bubble and 2008 crisis. The settlement includes a $2.4 billion civil penalty, $1.8 billion in relief payouts to underwater homeowners and affected borrowers and $875 million to resolve various other claims.This resolution holds Goldman Sachs accountable for its serious misconduct in falsely assuring investors that securities it sold were backed by sound mortgages, when it knew that they were full of mortgages that were likely to fail,  acting Associate Attorney General Stuart Delery said in a statement. In 2013, a Bloomberg article questioned how Goldman managed to survive and even thrive during the 2007-2008 economic crisis: Whether Goldman could have gone the way of Lehman Brothers or Merrill Lynch remains the subject of much debate. Goldman maintains that it did not need, or want, the $10 billion bailout that Hank Paulson [ former Goldman alum] pushed on it and other firms in October 2008. But the fact remains that when the Federal Reserve allowed Goldman and Morgan Stanley but not Lehman Brothers to become bank holding companies on Sept. 21, 2008, Goldman was able, three days later, to raise $10 billion in equity, $5 billion from the public and another $5 billion from investor Warren Buffett. That would probably not have happened without the Fed s expedited decision and support. (A week later, Morgan Stanley saved itself from bankruptcy when it negotiated a $9 billion equity investment from Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group.) All told the Clinton friendly investment giant Goldman Sachs (after making record profits) became the fifth mega-bank ordered to pay billions to the Department of Justice after the financial crash of 2007-2008. In addition, the firm was ordered to pay $3 billion to the Federal Housing Finance Agency in 2014   not including pending private lawsuits levied on the firm since the Great Recession.In a New York Review article Goldman Sachs was already under investigation for committing fraud at least a year before the economic crash in 2007-2008: Data gathered mostly from the Corporate Research Project, a public interest website, show that on thirteen occasions between 2009 and 2016, Goldman was penalized by US courts or government agencies for fraudulent or deceptive practices that were committed mostly between 2006 and 2009.   CASHING OUT    Bill Clinton with his top economic strategist Robert Rubin. (Image Source: St. Louis Post-Dispatch)Wall Street Selects  Team Clinton The Clinton connection to Goldman Sachs emerged in the early 1990 s as Robert Rubin, a former senior partner with Goldman (with a 26-year tenure with the firm), joined former President Clinton s economic policy team, later becoming Secretary of the Treasury in 1995. Around that time, the Clinton presidency ushered in soaring tax hikes under the  Rubinomics  banner (aka Clintonomics), the plan raised taxes on most Americans, specifically the middle class, in what was said to be the largest increase in American history at the time.According to Congressional record (Vol.146 part 2),  In 1995, the economy grew at a sickly 1.5%   Clinton s vetoes of spending cuts [insured] continued deficits well into the 21st Century. In a Multinational Monitor report entitled  Wall Street s Best Investment: Ten Deregulatory Steps to Financial Meltdown, by Robert Weissman and James Donahue, a clearer picture of the financial collusion spawned in the 1990 s under the Clinton administration was revealed: During the Clinton Administration, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, who had run Goldman Sachs, enthusiastically promoted the legislation. In a 1995 testimony before the House Banking Committee, for example, Rubin argued that  the banking industry is fundamentally different from what it was two decades ago, let alone in 1933.   U.S. banks generally engage in a broader range of securities activities abroad than is permitted domestically. Even domestically, the separation of investment banking and commercial banking envisioned by Glass-Steagall has eroded significantly. With a pedigree that included Goldman Sachs, the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), The Brookings Institution and the Bilderberg Group, Robert Rubin emerged in 1999 as the vice chairman at Citigroup (1999-2009) after overseeing its merger as well as helping to craft the repeal of Glass-Steagall while serving as Secretary of Treasury. Rubin made a fortune with Citigroup causing sharp criticism in media and from those within the financial sector following the 2007-2008 crash. Here s a passage from Bloomberg regarding Rubin in the aftermath of the banking collapse: When it collapsed, due in part to bank-friendly policies that Rubin advocated, he made more than $100 million while others lost everything.  You have to view people in a fair light,  says Phil Angelides, co-chair of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, who credits Rubin for much of the Clinton-era prosperity.  But on the other side of the ledger are key acts, such as the deregulation of derivatives, or stopping the Commodities Futures Trading Commission from regulating derivatives, that in the end weakened our financial system and exposed us to the risk of financial disaster.

(Image Source: thewhitehousespin)Under the MicroscopeOver the summer 21WIRE observed some curious connections between the Clinton Foundation and FBI director James Comey, as well as his questionable handling of other cases related to the Clinton family. Here s the following passage to consider in light of the new information related to the Clinton investigation: Many will also be unaware that before Comey was installed by the Obama Administration as FBI Director, he was on the board of Director at HSBC Bank   a bank implicated in international money laundering, including the laundering of billions on behalf of international drugs and narcotics trafficking cartels.Forbes also points out where Comey was also at the key choke-point during the case involving dodgy auditor KPMG which followed on by the HSBC criminal case: If Comey, and his boss Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez, had made a different decision about KPMG back in 2005, KPMG would not have been around to miss all the illegal acts HSBC and Standard Chartered SCBFF +% were committing on its watch. Bloomberg reported in 2007 that back in June of 2005, Comey was the man thrust into the position of deciding whether KPMG would live or die for its criminal tax shelter violations. In 2015, the Guardian discussed the financial relationship between HSBC and the Clinton Foundation receiving a startling $81 million in donations from clients of the large bank: The charitable foundation run by Hillary Clinton and her family has received as much as $81m from wealthy international donors who were clients of HSBC s controversial Swiss bank.Leaked files from HSBC s Swiss banking division reveal the identities of seven donors to the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation with accounts in Geneva. A new update on the FBI investigation into the Clinton Foundation was announced over the last 24 hours, in addition the recently reopened Clinton email probe from last week. It remains to be seen how in-depth this new investigation will be.To call it collusion would be an understatement. When looking back at the financial affairs of the Clintons, Goldman Sachs and others on Wall Street   it s clearer than ever that what we are looking at is a criminal syndicate.READ MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE   SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",US_News,"November 3, 2016"
4910, HILARIOUS: What A Trump Ad For Black Voters Would REALLY Look Like (VIDEO),"Donald Trump s presidential campaign has been trying hard to convince the media and (white) voters that he is wholeheartedly making an appeal to black voters. But in reality the Trump attempt to speak about the issues that black Americans have been insulting and ham-fisted at best.Taking that into consideration, Conan O Brien broadcast an ad poking fun at what Trump outreach to black voters would really look like:Like the real Trump campaign s efforts, the hilarious ad comes across more as something that a white person who has never interacted with a black person would come up with. It starts out echoing Trump in the way he has argued that black people have terrible lives, then ratchets up to point out different ways that Trump could pander to black voters   including appointing Denzel Washington to run the FAA.The comedic bit points out how bad the actual Trump work has been, showcasing just how little attention Trump gives to how real black Americans are dealing with life. Instead, Trump treats these voters as simpletons who are looking to him to be their savior. His pitch has literally been to ask black voters what else they have to lose, a far cry from a positive sales job.And black voters are   understandably   not responding to the Trump come-on. Polls show that Trump is on track to have less black vote support in the election than either John McCain or Mitt Romney did in their elections, although President Obama was on the ballot in those contests.Some polling in swing states has shown Trump polling at zero percent with black voters. They have largely been turned off by a campaign using the most nakedly racist appeals seen in such an effort since the pro-segregation  Dixiecrat  party was a player in the 1960s.Featured image via screen capture",News,"August 24, 2016"
16671,"A $50,000 FREE-FOR-ALL FOR MINORITIES In The Biggest Obama Scandal Yet","PIGFORD has to be the biggest scam and fraud EVER but I ll bet most Americans haven t even heard about it. IT S ALL ABOUT FREE MONEY! Yes, free money for everyone EXCEPT you have to be a minority to get the $50,000 and it s taxpayer dollars so it s NOT free at all. Our government has spent over $4 BILLION dollars on what was to be a small program to help minority farmers who felt they were discriminated against:Essentially, the process encouraged people to lie and spawned a cottage industry. Claimants had only to file applications for a $50,000 payment by stating that they had  thought about  applying for loans to become a farmer. Where s Congress on this big taxpayer giveaway? Oh, they re voting for billions more to go to this scam of major proportions The Obama administration has again been protected from a troubling scandal by the mainstream media (MSM) using the tactic of omission to simply ignore the scandal, its reality, and the negative blowback attendant to a disturbing story. As sunlight began to illuminate the scandal s inconvenient and troubling facts, charges of racism were used to temporarily silence those sounding the alarm. Seemingly, the alarm-ringers  only crime was having the temerity to respond with a politically incorrect point of view to abuses.The underreported scandal referenced is generally identified as  Pigford.  Pigford s germination occurred in 1997 as a lawsuit (Pigford vs. Glickman) alleging that 91 African-American farmers were unfairly denied loans by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) due to racial discrimination which prevented the complainants from farming. In 1999, the black farmers won their case.Pigford has the distinction of being an out-of-control waste of taxpayer funds and/or a cynical attempt by the Obama administration to curry favor with certain minority groups to which neither President Obama nor Attorney General Eric Holder can plead ignorance of involvement. Both have had knowledge since the court ruled on the Pigford lawsuit; in 2008, then-Senator Barack Obama supported and voted for the funding of the initial settlement. Since then, Eric Holder (and Obama) have been involved in overseeing and managing the Pigford  judgment fund. Yet can Pigford be fairly described as a scandal?Pigford began innocently enough: as a lawsuit to redress a perceived wrong against a group of 91. But then the number climbed to 400 .then 1,600 then The number of black farmers has metastasized   nay, exploded   and the aggrieved group now includes not only blacks, but Hispanics, Native Americans, and females. In fact over 90,000 people have filed claims seeking a payment under the terms of the original Pigford court ruling. That decision, now referred to as Pigford #1, was anticipated to cost approximately $120 million, including legal fees.Pigford #2 is the appellation used to identify an expanded payment regime that funds more payments to African-Americans, Native Americans, Hispanics, and females. This regimen grew out of the fact that thousands of claimants missed the original Pigford #1 filing deadline of October 12, 1999. Interestingly, Native American potential claimants were estimated at 5,300, while plaintiff lawyers pegged the exposure at an estimated 19,000 Native Americans. The judgment fund announced by Agricultural Secretary Thomas Vilsack and Eric Holder in 2010 was expanded from just over $120 million to $1.25 billion, given the expectation of many more filers.However, the explosion of claimants has caused payouts to reach $4.4 billion and has swelled legal fees to over $130 million. More importantly, the claim s process created a rush to get a share of the monies allocated to the judgment fund, even if no real claim existed. Essentially, the process encouraged people to lie and spawned a cottage industry. Claimants had only to file applications for a $50,000 payment by stating that they had  thought about  applying for loans to become a farmer. Proof of a claimant s intent to farm also included a statement from that petitioner saying he or she had attempted to farm by planting a batch of tomatoes in his or her backyard and having that statement verified by a family member. In essence, the need to be a farmer at the time of the alleged discriminatory actions by the USDA was not a requirement to share in the financial redress.Fraud was endemic to the claims process   for example, every apartment in a New York City building received a settlement of at least $50,000. Further, some families received checks of $50,000 for each family member.Read more: American Thinker",Government News,"Apr 3, 2016"

3304, BREAKING: Trump Calls For Increasing Our Ability To Destroy The World With Nuclear Weapons,"Donald Trump is INSANE.In yet another tweet demonstrating that he is poised to wipe out humanity, Trump called for expanding America s nuclear capability because he thinks the only way to convince the world that nukes are bad is if we make more of them.The United States must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 22, 2016But America already has an arsenal of over 6,000 nuclear warheads at the ready, and even that s too much since we could blow up the world over a dozen times and still have some nuclear weapons left.Only Russia has more nuclear weapons than us while most nations have an arsenal of a couple hundred or less, according to the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons.Anyway, lots of people are like,  BUT WE NEED MORE NUKES TO DEFEND OURSELVES!

Instead, it would force other nations to ramp up their own nuclear warhead production and increase the chances of a nuclear weapon falling into the hands of terrorists.And let s not forget that Donald Trump has already inquired into using nuclear weapons and suggested that he would use nuclear weapons in Europe.And now that Trump will have the nuclear codes and the ability to launch them whenever at whomever he pleases, this latest tweet makes it clear how dangerous Trump is. In fact, nothing stops him from nuking someone over the smallest of slights. And we damn sure have to wonder if Trump is set to financially profit from increased nuclear weapon production.Understandably, many Twitter users are freaking out now..@realDonaldTrump Expanding our nuclear weapons program is how we got into this mess in the first place.

18647,"CLASS ACT: Watch Betsy DeVos Respond While Students At Black College Yell, Heckle, Turn Backs On Her During Commencement Speech [VIDEO]","Betsy DeVos just proved to America why President Trump chose her among so many qualified candidates to reform our broken education system. Full-grown men would have crumbled under the kind of pressure and hate she was facing during her graceful commencement speech. Let s face it, most of us would have walked off the stage, but Betsy DeVos, firm in her resolution to deliver the speech she was invited to share, stood at the podium, and against all odds, addressed an angry group of students railing against  the injustice  at a college where 95% of the students receive some form of state or federal grant money.During the roughly 25-minute speech, DeVos took time to address the criticism that s come her way since she was unveiled as the university s graduation speaker, telling the crowd it was important to converse with and learn from people despite disagreements.The natural instinct is to join in the chorus of conflict, to make your voice louder, your point bigger and your position stronger,  DeVos said.  But we will not solve the significant and real problems our country faces if we cannot bring ourselves to embrace a mindset of grace. We must first listen, then speak   with humility   to genuinely hear the perspectives of those with whom we don t immediately or instinctively agree,  she continued.While DeVos spoke, the students continued to heckle and yell over DeVos as she persevered through her speech. The University president who was clearly embarrassed by the behavior of the graduates finally stepped up to the microphone to address the students in hopes of getting the disrespectful group under control telling them,  If this behavior continues, your degrees will be mailed to you. Choose which way you wanna go.  He then implored the students to be seated.The students chose to continue with their embarrassing behavior, at which time DeVos began to once again address the crowd:Many Bethune-Cookman University students, alumni and supporters made their disapproval of DeVos  appearance known well before she took the stage.On Tuesday, Bethune-Cookman University students and alumni delivered thousands of signatures to the school s president, Edison O. Jackson, and the university s Board of Trustees in a last-ditch effort to try and change their minds about inviting DeVos to speak.DeVos, a West Michigan native, initially drew ire from students and supporters from historically black colleges and universities, or HBCUs, throughout the country after she connected HBCUs to the school choice movement in February. MLiveDeVos recently met with presidents and chancellors of historically black colleges and universities, or HBCUs, at the White House. Following that meeting, she said in a statement that a key priority for the administration was to help develop opportunities for underserved communities, and praised HBCUs for fulfilling that mission all along. They started from the fact that there were too many students in America who did not have equal access to education,  she said in the statement.  They saw that the system wasn t working, that there was an absence of opportunity, so they took it upon themselves to provide the solution. DeVos continued:  HBCUs are real pioneers when it comes to school choice. They are living proof that when more options are provided to students, they are afforded greater access and greater quality. Critics were quick to point out on social media that HBCUs were initially founded in part because black students often did not have the option to enroll in existing public institutions in the South.Others noted public HBCUs were generally not offered the same amount of funding and resources predominantly white colleges and universities received.In an interview with The Chronicle of Higher Education about the controversy, Dillard University President Walter Kimbrough said similar comments she made in the listening session  didn t come across as ill-spirited,  but was a poor analogy. I think she was honestly trying to find a way to connect her experience with HBCUs,  he told The Chronicle of Higher Education.  MLive ",left-news,"May 11, 2017"
1871, Nunes’ Replacement In Trump Investigation Defended Russian Hackers And Putin,"The new leader of what can laughably be called an  investigation  into the Trump Team s collusion with Russia to undermine our democracy makes disgraced House Intelligence Committee chair Devin Nunes look almost sane.When he recused himself (temporarily) from the investigation after he became the subject of his own congressional ethics investigation for releasing classified information in an effort to help Donald Trump, Nunes handed off his duties to Texas Republican Rep.

That might work on Saturday afternoon when my wife s (Texas Tech) Red Raiders are playing the Texas Longhorns,  Conaway said.  She really like the Red Raiders.

Those are foreign actors, foreign people, influencing the vote in Nevada. You don t hear the Democrats screaming and saying one word about that. Asked whether that is the same as Russia interfering in our election, Conaway didn t back down: Sure it is, it s foreign influence. If we re worried about foreign influence, let s have the whole story. Assisting Conaway will be Trey Gowdy, who recently found himself the subject of an ethics complaint for accepting donations from anti-Clinton groups while he was investigating her and Tom Rooney, who very vocally opposed Clinton.Something tells me these guys won t be taking this seriously.Featured image via Getty Images (Mark Wilson)/screengrab",News,"April 6, 2017"
6882, National Republican Just Blamed Women For Assaults — Again (VIDEO),"Republican presidential candidate and current Ohio governor John Kasich made strange remarks about sexual assault during a town hall event in New York. Kasich echoed many conservatives and laid the blame on women for these crimes.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8FqEIgQMW0Asked about the risk of campus sexual assault during a Friday campaign event, Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) advised a female student not to  go to parties where there s a lot of alcohol. The Republican presidential candidate was hosting a town hall in Watertown, New York when a freshman student from St. Lawrence University asked how he would help her  feel safer and more secure regarding sexual violence, harassment, and rape,  according to ABC News.Simply going to a party where there s a lot of alcohol is not any kind of excuse for a woman being assaulted. Yet conservatives, who repeatedly have denied that there is a rape culture on many college campuses, have regularly cited how women are dressed or what sort of parties they attend when addressing this vital issue.By comparison, the Obama administration launched the  It s On Us  initiative to highlight the role men have to play in stopping sexual assault on campus. Vice President Joe Biden, who helped to author the Violence Against Women Act has often served as a spokesperson for the initiative.Despite the conservative pushback, progressive groups spearheaded by women s leadership have placed campus sexual assault on the top tier of issues to be dealt with by college officials as well as elected officials at the local, state, and federal levels.Increasingly views like Governor Kasich s that put the onus of responsibility on female victims are becoming the minority, while fathers, sons, and brothers have come to realize that blame is a weak and ineffective response.Republicans have found out more often than not, that their insensitive remarks about rape, abortion, and other issues affecting women have fed into the larger story of a  war on women,  and they end up losing elections.

Haag asked the store employees if they d been robbed and they told him yes, so he decided to take the law into his own hands. Instead of calling the police like an intelligent human being, Haag got into his car and chased the suspected robbers. ABC15 news obtained a video that shows Haag pulling up to the U-Haul the men were driving and firing his gun at the vehicle. After shooting at the suspects, he drove away.According to officials, the people who Haag shot at weren t robbery suspects at all. Instead all they had done was shoplifted from the store. Police said that this crime would not justify the level of force  used by a man who said he wanted to  be a hero. Cops were able to find the idiot after he posted  just witnessed a robbery at Walgreens again, this time, I had my gun true story  on Facebook.Speaking to ABC15, Haag said: I feel I had good intentions. I meant the best. I meant to disable the vehicle. First of all, he completely missed the vehicle that he was firing at   clearly he should not be shooting a weapon when his aim is that bad. Secondly, he discharged the firearm in the middle of traffic and that bullet could have ricocheted and killed someone. Haag went on to say that he thinks more people should try to be heroes: Most people are scared. Tons of people nowadays are in fear of what will happen to them and that s not cool. That s why we have more crime. He s right, I do fear what will happen to me, my family and my friends, but not because of shoplifters. I am way more concerned that I or someone I love is going to be killed by a dumbass like him who thinks it s okay to fire a gun in traffic. I worry that my son is going to be Second Amendmented to death by gun nuts. I worry about things like that because it is obvious that we have millions of gun owners in this country and many of them do not have the common sense given to a squirrel.Haag has been charged with aggravated assault, unlawful discharge of a firearm and drive-by shooting.

14696,"[VIDEO] GERMAN MAYOR Blames Victims Of Mass Rape, Sexual Assault By Muslim Migrants For Not Defending Themselves","Because blaming the Muslim migrants who raped and sexually assaulted an untold number of women on New Years Eve would be politically incorrect and certainly not very hospitable A political scandal is developing in Germany as ordinary citizens wake up to the scale of the migrant crime cover-up, and the callous reaction of the mayor of Cologne to mass-sex crime on new year s eve.The Mayor of Cologne has spoken out about the attacks, but her carefully chosen words are unlikely to delight many. Rather than addressing the root causes of the violence   unlimited mass migration and a totally failed system of integration   the newly elected pro-migrant mayor instead blamed the victims of the sexual abuse for having failed to defend themselves against the immigrant attackers.Here is a video of the shocking chaos that took place on New Years Eve:Speaking on live television this afternoon mayor Henriette Reker, who was near-fatally stabbed in the run up to October elections by an anti mass migration campaigner, said in future women would have to be better prepared in her city to deal with migrants.She remarked:  The women and young girls have to be more protected in the future so these things don t happen again. This means, they should go out and have fun, but they need to be better prepared, especially with the Cologne carnival coming up. For this, we will publish online guidelines that these young women can read through to prepare themselves .What form this guidance will take is presently unclear, the mayor could take inspiration from young victim whose modest clothes protected them from the worst consequences of walking at night in areas controlled by migrant men. The woman said:  Fortunately I wore a jacket and trousers. a skirt would probably have been torn away from me .Despite her words of warning towards women in the city they could prepare for more violence against them, she refuted the suggestion there was any link between the attacks and migrants, contradicting her own chief of police.An opposition council member has today sounded the alarm bell on the deteriorating state of control the local government has over the city of Cologne, and in an official letter from the council group has warned those planning to come to the famous Cologne council next month  the city and the police  are unable to guarantee the safety of locals and tourists .Council group leader and lawyer Judith Wolter said in her letter to the people of Cologne today:  I want as a member of the Cologne City Council  to submit a travel warning for the carnival time in Cologne city centre. Especially the area in and around the central station, the cathedral and the adjoining area towards the banks of the Rhine for tourists (and locals) is no longer considered even in normal times as safe. For months, there is in these areas numerous thefts, open drug dealing, robberies and harassment of all kinds  Dozens of women were sexually harassed in public and there was at least one rape. Neither the city nor the police are able to guarantee in the territory described the safety of tourists and locals. Especially for women it must be assumed that a high security risk is here in the evening and night hours. At New Year s Eve there was a legal vacuum and a no-go area for women. With the climax of the Carnival season it is unfortunately expected to be a similar situation .German police have admitted to losing several urban areas to migrant gangs as so-called no-go zones, but this is possibly the first time a public square in the centre of a European city has been acknowledged by officials as having been lost to criminality, and out of the control of police at night.News of the attacks was suppressed for days, with just short reports of isolated incidents in Cologne city centre making it to local outlets on New Year s Day.The Kolnifsche Rundschau described the scene at the railways station as  largely peaceful  and made no effort to describe those who attacked the young women, one of which told press she had  fingers on every orifice  after she was stripped near naked.Only after nearly 100 victims of assault and abuse came forwards to police, and stories of attacks started circulating on social media did the truth of the situation start to slowly emerge, forcing local police to hold a press conference on Monday afternoon.Despite the chief of police admitting the enormous scale of sexual assault and confirming the attackers were of  North African and Arab  origin, much of the mainstream media is still in damage control mode, either trying to shift the focus from migrants, or avoiding the events completely.

While this is symbolic, it s a big symbol.The Sunday tradition is 138 years old, and as Melinda Bates, the Easter event organizer behind President Bill Clinton s eight times as host, told The New York Times,  It s the single most high-profile event that takes place at the White House each year, and the White House and the first lady are judged on how well they put it on.

Congress members have also not been contacted about tickets for their constituents.Because of this, the event has been cut in half and they ll only have about 1/5th of the security, and it s all because the First Lady has been neglegent in even staffing her office. She named a chief of staff and social secretary in early February but has yet to announce a director for the Visitors Office, normally the crucial player in the daunting execution of the event,  the Times reported.The vacant positions are cause for concern, according to Bates.  I m really concerned for the Trump people. This thing is all hands on deck.

After the Berlin attack, Dr. James Mitchell spoke about what has come to be in Europe and warned America about how this could happen to us too!Dr. James Mitchell is the man who interrogated the 9/11 mastermind and is an expert on terrorism. He warns against immigration and political correctness as two things that will lead us to doom. If you doubt Dr. Mitchell, please see the video below this one for more on the truth of what mass migration is really about. Slow down our immigration from these countries    Dr. James MitchellWE VE REPORTED ON THE TRUTH OF WHAT IMMIGRATION IS DOING   IT S A PLAN   IT S A CALIPHATE!Last September, a shocking video was released showing a Muslim Imam speaking before a group. He told the group to breed with Europeans. Yes, the plan is to breed with Europeans until all of Europe is Muslim. THE VIDEO IS BELOW:So now we have a second video from Denmark where an Imam is telling how Muslims are conquering Europe and that Muslims won t integrate into European society. We ve translated the video in the text below.These two videos follow with what we know. The invasion of Europe has a purpose and it s a very dark purpose. Conquering Europe is the end game Is America next?On hidden camera an imam explains how Muslims are  conquering  Europe and that Muslims should not integrate into society.Danish TV2 right now has a program called  Mosques behind the veil  which is focusing on whether a number of mosques discourage or contribute to integration.  Right now we are in a time when we are opening these countries, says Mohammad Fouad al-Barazi, the head imam of the mosque of the Islamic Union in Denmark, in secret recordings from the third episode of  Mosques behind the veil .The Imam speaks to TV2 s mole  Fatima , who is seeking guidance about how she as a newly immigrated Muslim should act in Denmark, and Mohammad Fouad al-Barazi explains that Muslims are now consuming Denmark and Europe.The link to the video is here but it is not translated: NYHEDER VIDEOAccording to experts TV2 has spoken with, the word open in an Islamist meaning is understood as  conquering .  Actually, opening sounds  beautiful , but this is the classic term for conquering a country, explains Professor Tina Magaard, who has studied the Quran and made fieldwork in Muslim communities in Denmark.According to Tina Magaard, some Islamic movements have the will to conquer Europe and the belief that one can.It is backed by a professor at the University of Copenhagen, Thomas Hoffmann, who has studied Islam and Islamic movements.  What al-Barazi says here, means conquest, but need not necessarily be understood as war-like conquest, he said.On hidden camera, Mohammad Fouad al-Barazi, elaborates what he thinks about Muslims  entry into Denmark and Europe.  Now there are Muslim communities throughout Europe. This means that there are a large number of Muslims. A really large number.The Imam tells  Fatma  that since he came to Denmark, many more Muslims have come to Denmark, and it is important that Muslims are not  merged  with the rest of society.  When I came to this country 23 years ago, we were only 55,000 Muslims. Now we are 300,000. The number of Muslims is 300,000 now. Hence the conclusion of this talk is that it is possible to live in this country without melting in. You must understand the conditions, without melting into society, says Mohammad Fouad Al-Barazi in the recordings.Via: nyheder",politics,"May 28, 2017"

7697, Trump Promises To Defend Racist Fans That Attack Protesters (VIDEO),"When Donald Trump isn t bragging about the size of his d*ck, threatening his enemies, spouting horrific racist remarks, attacking easy targets Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, or screaming angrily that prominent religious figures disagree with his bigotry, he falls back on one of his favorite hobbies: enjoying the show as his racist, violent supporters beat people up in his name. It s almost impossible to watch the three-ring circus that is a Trump rally without seeing his uneducated fans beat someone up for expressing an opinion.Trump s supporters  favorite targets are rather unsurprising given his massive support among white supremacists. Recently, The Donald ordered police to remove about 30 peaceful African-American students from one of his rallies just for being there while black. But, of course, things could have been much worse for them. Normally, if an African-American speaks out against Trump at one of his events, he or she is met with violence.After an African-American man at a rally in Birmingham, Alabama, stood up for himself and declared that black lives matter just as much as white lives, Trump supporters descended on him, punching, kicking, and dragging the man simply because expressed an opinion as well as calling him a  n*gger  and other slurs. Trump could have denounced this violence and hate. Instead, he explained that  maybe he should have been roughed up. One Trump supporter, Robert Kiger, told CNN at the time that the man deserved it because Birmingham, Alabama, a historical hotbed of KKK activity in which many civil rights battles took place, is  no place for Black Lives Matter to try to bring their issues to the forefront. More recently, a Trump fan was discharged from the United States Marine Corp. for his role in an attack on a black woman at a rally in Louisville, Kentucky. Again, Trump responded to the controversy surrounding the regular attacks (In this case, he chose to reference an attack on a New Hampshire protester who was one of the few white people his supporters attacked) by telling his supporters it s OK to attack  protesters. The Donald called the various beatings protesters receive at the hands of his fans  really amazing to watch,  and explained that he was tired of  political correctness    the right-wing term for not being a homophobic, racist, misogynist prick   when it came to how dissent is handled at his rallies. When he was interrupted by a protester, he again condoned his supporters  actions: Are Trump rallies the most fun?  he said.  We re having a good time.  While most would consider an environment where violence is the response to mild dissent an absolute f*cking nightmare,While most would consider an environment where violence is the response to mild dissent an absolute f*cking nightmare, Trump and his fans embrace it wholeheartedly.Watch Trump give his supporters permission to attack protesters below:Featured image via screengrab",News,"March 4, 2016"
22677,Trial By YouTube: Mainstream Media Use Second-hand Oregon Account to Cast Blame on Dead Rancher," Patrick Henningsen 21st Century WireThere exists a famous quote often attributed to 1918 US Senator Hiram Warren Johnson, who once said,  The first casualty when war comes is truth.  The same could be said for Waco, or Ruby Ridge   or with the federal government s version of recent events in Burns, Oregon.  What really happened on Highway 395? We re not sure yet, but in the meantime, it seems as if the mainstream media have already decided who is guilty and and who is not.Regarding the Tuesday evening s events at the Oregon Standoff, where federal agents shot and killed rancher Robert  Lavoy  Finicum, a campaign of disinformation appears to be rapidly underway. The following is a prime exhibit of how the mainstream media can spin a story to favor the government version of events.The Washington Post s brash headline reads,  Report: LaVoy Finicum, armed with a handgun, reached for his waistband just before he was shot. In the absence of any actual evidence, or even analysis to support this deceptive headline, instead Washington Post writer Mike Miller attempts to weave together a classic example of yellow journalism.Any speculation or public skepticism could be easily put to rest by the FBI releasing all video footage of the event in question. (Above screen shot: Washington Post)Miller begins his piece establishing Finicum s guilt in his own murder by nature of the fact that Robert  Lavoy  Finicum had been seen previously carrying a gun. Everyone knew that LaVoy Finicum kept a Colt .45 on his hip. That common knowledge could help explain how the occupier in Oregon died. Miller s article then hammers home the federal thesis that any injured or dead protesters  brought it on themselves : The occupiers had ample opportunity to leave peacefully,  FBI Special Agent Greg Bretzing said Wednesday morning.  They brought this on themselves. In other words, according to the FBI, and with the help of the media, dead rancher Lavoy Finicum is guilty in the court of public opinion.Marginalizing the WitnessMiller immediate moves to cast doubt on the testimony of 18 yr old Victoria Sharp, who was a passenger in the truck Finicum was driving, crassly describing the young woman as a  self-described witness . He adds: Another self-described witness disputes that, saying that authorities opened fire before the getaway chase and that Finicum had his hands up when he was shot.  STOIC: Ammon Bundy, Ryan Bundy and Lavoy Finicum at the Wildlife Refuge last week.Instead, Miller relies heavily on a YouTube video recorded and uploaded by a man named Mark McConnell who was not at the scene of the actual shooting (he admits that he was one mile away) when federal agents reportedly killed Finicum. Admittedly, McConnell s testimony, claiming that Finicum had  charged at the officers  is only second-hand, or possibly third-hand, depending on the accuracy of what he is attempting relaying from other passengers riding with in the vehicle with Sharp at the time, Ryan Payne and Shawna Cox.Here, McConnell is, in effect, issuing a proxy statement on behalf of Victoria Sharp s fellow passengers, Shawn Cox and Ryan Payne. This is hardly admissible, as both Cox and Payne are currently in federal custody and are not able to verify the accuracy of McConnell reiteration. And yet, mainstream media outlets are propping-up McConnell s account as if it were somehow factual.Clearly, this is a  nudging  exercise, carefully attempting to minimize and discredit the young female witness Sharp. The Post s Miller makes this blatantly obvious when he subtly inserts that Sharp,  who said she was the 18 year old in the car with Finicum . What?  Who said she was the 18 yr old ? Here is in context: McConnell s account conflicts with statements made by Victoria Sharp, who said she was the 18-year-old in the car with Finicum. One would think that a Washington Post headline journalist would have ample resources to confirm whether or not Sharp was in the truck or not.Why are mainstream media outlets so quick to try and discredit the testimony of Victoria Sharp? Unlike the mainstream media s  go-to  man McConnell, Victoria Sharp is an actual eye witness who saw first-hand the fateful event in question, and described it in detail immediately after the event during a phone interview. What s more amazing is how a newspaper like the Washington Post, presumably with a good reputation for high journalistic standards (one would think so anyway) would grab a recycled, second-hand account which first appeared on the tabloid news website Raw Story.What The Post is attempting to do here is clear: to try and align a secondhand speculative guess by McConnell with a vague  anonymous  statement leaked from the FBI to CNN.Sadly for news consumers, it s not uncommon that networks like CNN will often accept vague anonymous leaks from  sources  in order to construct an official narrative of any event   with absolutely zero accountability from either the government source, or the news network.It s almost as if Miller is writing this piece on behalf of the FBI.At the very least here, the Washington Post is playing a supporting role   acting as an additional PR channel and echo chamber for a claim which neither CNN or the government are required to either confirm or deny. Sources  Say Finicum Was Reaching for His WaistbandRather than question any of the claims fashioned by CNN and its  sources  journalist Mike Miller does the opposite   he tries to reinforce the government narrative.CNN International s report hinges on a  anonymous government source  claiming that Finicum was killed by federal agents because he was  reaching towards his waistband.  Miller writes: In the moments before he was shot by authorities Tuesday afternoon, Finicum led a high-speed getaway attempt. He then reached for his waistband, prompting authorities to open fire, according to a CNN report.The report, which cites anonymous law enforcement officials but has not been confirmed by The Washington Post, is corroborated by a statement from an occupier who said he was traveling with Finicum at the time of the traffic stop. The fact the media have chosen to label this incident as a  traffic stop  indicates an obvious agenda designed to minimize the obvious   that this was a pre-planned, elaborate ambush by the FBI and Oregon State Police.The Washington Post then tries to enhance CNN s phantom report by aligning the government narrative with the second-hand story presented by Mark McConnell, further propping-up the government s version of events:This same unnamed  source  cited by CNN has also told the network that the incident was captured on video by the FBI, but that authorities  have not decided whether or not the release the video. One indication that this anonymous leak to CNN is likely bogus is the fact that the statement says Finicum  reached for his waistband , but chose not to say,  reached for his gun    which offers the government a convenient exit from their previous statement should an unincriminating video ever surface for public viewing. In addition, the fact that the alleged damning video has not already been released could mean that the video footage in question does not support the government innuendo story which has been leaked out via government-media information channels.Any public distrust or skepticism of the federal authorities would immediately be dispelled by speed release of all video footage (with dozens of agents and surveillance, there should have been more than one video feed taken, including body and gun sight cameras) of the event. Whether or not, and how fast this will happen remains to be seen.Two Versions of EventsWhat s abundantly clear after listening to both McConnell and Sharp s conflicting testimonies, is that McConnell s statement  is quite obviously unreliable and full of self-contradictions and caveats, while Sharp s is clear and concise.The following is the testimony of Victoria Sharp, recorded in the immediate aftermath of the shooting on Oregon highway 395:  Anyone looking at this story can see clearly that protesters  vehicles were traveling to a pre-arranged community event in the nearby small town of John Day   an event supported by neighboring Grant County Sheriff Glenn Palmer. Palmer was sympathetic to the Bundy s protest and publicly called for the release of the Hammond family whom he believes were wrongfully imprisoned. Oregon Live reported the Palmer was there at the FBI roadblock on Highway 395 alongside a large contingent of armed Federal Agents. If true, this would indicates that Palmer had prior knowledge federal ambush, but more importantly, that he clearly ceded his own legal and Consitutional authority as the county s chief law enforcement official over to the FBI s special agent in charge Greg Bretzing. Absent of any public statement from Palmer on the matter, onlookers can only speculate about this situation.IMPORTANT NOTE (UPDATE 1-30-16): According to this recent report by Pedro Quintana from Central Oregon local affiliate News Channel 21, Sheriff Palmer was not at the federal roadblock and had no prior knowledge of the FBI ambush of the Bundy convoy. According to the chat session relayed in Pedro Quintana s report, Palmer was asked in an online chat,  Did you witness Lavoy shooting, or no? , to which Palmer replies,  NO  The shooting from what I hear was close to 4 and I heard of it at about 5:45pm.  News 21continued: Palmer responded he had no knowledge of anything about the plans or who was coming to the public meeting. He went on to say that the  FBI and Oregon State Police know me, they shared nothing with me and they know I wouldn t have allowed it. Earlier mainstream media reports that Palmer was present at the FBI roadblock would lead Bundy supporters to believe that Palmer had betrayed the Bundys and Lavoy Finicum. One the main sources, if not the main source of the original Sheriff Palmer controversy appears to be none other than Oregon Live staff writer Les Zaitz who has slipped-in this key piece of line into his report which which says: They said they didn t know how long the roadblock would be place. Grant County Sheriff Glenn Palmer was there.  Not surprisingly, this has set-off a virtual backlash online against the Grant County Sheriff, as evidenced by the following screen shot of Google search link found here:  Is this a case of media dirty tricks by Oregon Live? Certainly, Oregon Live s coverage of Burns events has been skewed from the beginning, and have been running character assassination pieces against Malheur occupiers in a effort to discredit the protest. Sheriff Palmer is clearly on record as being sympathetic to the Hammond Ranch protest and had recently opened up a constructive dialogue with the Bundys and occupiers from Malheur Wildlife Refuge. If Pedro Quintana s News 21 report is indeed accurate, then one might conclude that Oregon Live put out a piece of disinformation, likely designed to further divide the protest movement and create dissension in militia and activist ranks. However, until Sheriff Glenn Palmer comes out and issues clear statement declaring where he was   and where he wasn t, then people will continue to speculate what really happened. (END OF UPDATE)NOTE: See more in depth and legal analysis on Sheriff Palmer and the FBI s operation at Free Capitalist.Amazingly, The Post s writer Mike Miller goes on to all but admit a premeditated ambush of the protester s vehicles on Highway 395, and yet, will not call it what it was   an ambush: According to the CNN report, the FBI and Oregon State Police had been watching occupiers come and go from the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge near Burns for days before they spotted a rare opportunity to nab the militant movement s leaders all at once: Finicum, Ammon Bundy, Ryan Bundy and a handful of others climbed into two trucks and drove from the refuge to a meeting in John Day, Ore., two hours north. Authorities chose a cold, deserted stretch of highway to attempt a traffic stop. One vehicle complied with orders and pulled over, but the other  allegedly driven by Finicum  sped off at high speed, according to the report. It should be noted (although never by the Washington Post or CNN) that the protest s leader, Ammon Bundy, had met with FBI negotiators that morning continuing an open dialogue that had been going on for weeks. This, plus the fact that Sheriff Palmer had invited Bundy and his fellow protesters to the community event in John Day, demonstrated that both the Federal government and the local Sheriff had acted in bad faith by drawing all of the main protesters out to the town of John Day, along a pre-planned route, before staging such an ambush with overwhelming force just hours later. The fact that a man is dead definitely underlines the seriousness of their course of action   which appears to be a case of deception on the part of authorities.Similarly, right after the event most mainstream media were calling the event a  shoot-out , even though it was obvious that no shots were fired by vehicle passengers. Granted, such deceptive language by media is nothing new, but it s still further indication that there was a deliberate attempt to skew the narrative in favor of law enforcement s official version of events.UPDATE 1-28-2016 at 11:30PM ET: Due to public pressure and intense speculation about the events of Tuesday evening, and because of the YouTube recording of 18 yr old eye witness Victoria Sharp, the FBI has released the unedited aerial video footage from Tuesday evening s incident which took place along Highway 395 here. According to the official FBI statement:  We feel that it is necessary to show the whole thing unedited in the interest of transparency.  The FBI video entitled,  Complete, Unedited Video of Joint FBI and OSP Operation 01/26/2016 , does show the victim Lavoy Finicum exiting the truck awkwardly in at least two feet of snow, and he clearly does not  charge towards  the SWAT team, and his hands are clearly held high above his head as he exits his truck when confronted by a SWAT team, before being shot multiple times by marksmen and falling in the snow. Also, the scale and size of this operation is very evident by the footage, and the apprehension of the protesters was not the result of a mere  traffic stop  as it was wrongly characterized in multiple mainstream media reports. On its own, this FBI drone footage would appear to support previous government and media claims by CNN, Washington Post and others that the victim was indeed  reaching towards his waistband  which gave federal and state police justification to unleash deadly force. However, it is still not completely clear from this aerial footage whether or not Finicum was holstered (he is said to normally carry a gun on the right hip, but FBI are claiming he had a 9mm gun in his inside left breast pocket), but also whether or not he lowered his arms before, or after he was shot multiple times. For example, if Finicum had his hands in the air and was then was shot in the abdomen first, then any man s natural reaction would be to then lower his hand(s) and clutch the wound. Additionally, if any shots were fired, even in the vicinity, then confusion could have ensued which might have prompted Finicum to reach for his weapon. Either way, it is impossible to make any such a forensic determination without a corresponding audio track  which would help to determine if any shots were fired before Finicum s hand(s) could be seen lowering. WARNING: The following images depict violence and death which some readers may find disturbing. Watch: Finicum appears to temporarily lose his balance in the snow at the very moment he looks to be hit by agents.What is clear however from this video is that armed agents did not shoot to disable their suspect, but shot to kill and even had a laser sight trained on him for many minutes after he was downed. Clearly, multiple SWAT shooters could be seen emerging from the woods. After killing Finicum, police then left the victim to bleed to death laying in the snow, and did not check on him for at least another 8 minutes.Flash-bang rounds can be seen around the 14:00 mark of the FBI s  unedited  version, and the FBI has said that it fired CS gas and  non lethal rounds  (possibly pepper spray rounds, or rubber bullets) are said to have been fired at the truck while the passengers were inside. This begs the question: with nonlethal rounds already in play   why did multiple SWAT shooters use so many deadly rounds against Finicum when he exited the truck with his hands up?See 21WIRE s detailed report of the federal ambush on Highway 395 in Oregon here.READ MORE OREGON STANDOFF  NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Oregon Files",US_News,"January 28, 2016"
4917," Trump Caught Illegally Buying $55,000 Worth Of His Own Book… With Campaign Donations","Donald Trump has been caught buying $55,000 worth of his own books and he paid this hefty bill with money from campaign donations, which is flat out illegal if he gets any royalties from the sales.As reported by The Daily Beast: On May 10, the Trump campaign paid Barnes & Noble $55,055, according to a filing with the Federal Election Commission. That amounts to more than 3,500 copies of the hardcover version of Crippled America: How to Make America Great Again, or just over 5,000 copies of the renamed paperback release, Great Again: How to Fix Our Crippled America. According to a spokesperson for Trump, these books were purchased for gift bags given to delegates at the Republican National Convention. Indeed, delegates did each receive a copy of Crippled America along with miscellaneous Make America Great Again gear and a plastic fetus, all neatly stuffed into tote bags bearing the same trademark slogan.But here is where the problem lies, under Federal Elections Committee rules, Trump cannot legally be paid royalties on the books bought by the campaign. Paul Ryan (not the one you are thinking of), from the nonpartisan nonprofit Campaign Legal Center, explains: It s fine for a candidate s book to be purchased by his committee, but it s impermissible to receive royalties from the publisher,  Ryan said.  That amounts to an illegal conversion of campaign funds to personal use. There s a well established precedent from the FEC that funds from the campaign account can t end up in your own pocket. Neither the Trump campaign nor the book s publisher, Simon & Schuster, has been willing to comment. Regardless, federal campaign law clearly states that campaign spending cannot  result in the conversion of campaign funds to the personal use of the candidate or any other person. It may be the case for a candidate to instead donate those royalties to charity that might be a permissible arrangement,  said the CLC s Ryan.  But the bottom line is, no money of this $55,000 from the book can end up in Donald Trump s pocket without violating federal law. It isn t exactly unusual for celebrities or politicians to buy copies of their own books, or to give them away. However, Ben Bruton, who has spent the past 25 years working in publishing public relations, the circumstances surrounding Trump s purchase is suspicious. What any author that I know would most likely do is go to the publisher and say,  I want a bunch of these in the goody bag.  [The author would] come to the publisher and say he needed books for a charity or an event, and we would donate 500 all the time. And we ll sell more to you at a 40 percent discount,  said Bruton. The red flag, I think, would be that they re trying to get back on The[New York] Times Best Sellers list, or they re trying to buy them at retail for royalties. If Trump s books were bought at a brick and mortar store like Barnes and Noble, then they will count towards best-seller lists. I ve worked at four different of the major six publishing houses and a lot of times people want to buy a bunch of books to get on the list. You can t do it from Amazon. You can t buy them from the publisher,  said Bruton.  Only buying from place likes Barnes & Noble at full price is looked at as sales. Bruton added that at least the Times list is aware of the possibility of authors buying their way to the top with bulk sales and has penalties in place to prevent this. That s how the Times keeps that sort of in check, so you can t just buy your way onto the Best Sellers list,  he said. However, I do believe that was definitely an attempt to both make money and to get onto the best-seller list,  Bruton added.Featured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images",News,"August 24, 2016"
14720,"Serial Plagiarist Does Victory Dance Over White People Dying, Trump Can’t Save You!","White people the only lives that DON T matter. Imagine the outrage if he were taking a victory lap over a study showing Muslims dying in increasing numbers Citing a study that shows Middle American whites are dying in increasing numbers, like a twisted and bitter eugenicist, serial-plagiarist Fareed Zakaria doesn t even attempt to contain his glee. By painting those who are supposedly dying as useless, drug-addicted ragers, he paints a picture of a weak, angry, and ultimately stupid ethnic group getting what it deserves.If this were any other group, Zakaria would not be using the pages of the Washington Post for a victory dance. Instead, he would be launching an emotional blackmail campaign to cure this  epidemic  with hundreds of billions of federal dollars. Like most of the elite media, though, Zakaria despises Middle America, so he joyously assumes the study is accurate and bloodlessly screams  Told You So! The headline says it all:  America s Self-Destructive Whites,  and naturally the opening paragraph contains the words  Donald  and  Trump. Why is Middle America killing itself? The fact itself is probably the most important social science finding in years. It is already reshaping American politics. The Post s Jeff Guo notes that the people who make up this cohort are  largely responsible for Donald Trump s lead in the race for the Republican nomination for president. What does this  epidemic  mean to Zakaria?That it s time for compassion?Time for government action?Time for understanding?No. It means  more rage  from creepy Middle America:The key question is why, and exploring it provides answers that suggest that the rage dominating U.S. politics will only get worse.Zakaria hints that the study s numbers are a tad shaky, but that doesn t stop him from doing a happy dance around the fact that Middle America s Got It Coming .The main causes of death are as striking as the fact itself: suicide, alcoholism, and overdoses of prescription and illegal drugs.  People seem to be killing themselves, slowly or quickly,  Deaton told me. These circumstances are usually caused by stress, depression and despair.Middle America s a Bunch of Wussies .A conventional explanation for this middle-class stress and anxiety is that globalization and technological change have placed increasing pressures on the average worker in industrialized nations. But the trend is absent in any other Western country   it s an exclusively American phenomenon. And the United States is actually relatively insulated from the pressures of globalization, having a vast, self-contained internal market.Stupid Middle America Should Stop Voting Against the Welfare State Deaton speculated to me that perhaps Europe s more generous welfare state might ease some of the fears associated with the rapid change.Middle America s Spoiled By White Privilege [O]ther groups might not expect that their income, standard of living and social status are destined to steadily improve. They don t have the same confidence that if they work hard, they will surely get ahead. In fact, Rouse said that after hundreds of years of slavery, segregation and racism, blacks have developed ways to cope with disappointment and the unfairness of life[.]They do not assume that the system is set up for them. They try hard and hope to succeed, but they do not expect it as the norm.Donald Trump Can t Save You!Mwuh, huh, huh, huh Donald Trump has promised that he will change this and make them win again.

2860, Trump Just Praised Fox News’ Ratings And Attacked CNN Again Then Got CRUSHED By Twitter (TWEETS),"If you haven t yet heard that Fox News came out on top in ratings during Donald Trump s inauguration, all you need to do is check President Asterisk s Twitter timeline. After a rousing first few days of working toward dismantling Obamacare, endangering the health of women and girls worldwide, and signing our environment away for a few short-term construction jobs, The Donald hopped on Twitter to get right back to what appears to be his real job: attacking news agencies that report unflattering details about him. Congratulations to @FoxNews for being number one in inauguration ratings,  Trump tweeted.  They were many times higher than FAKE NEWS @CNN   public is smart! Congratulations to @FoxNews for being number one in inauguration ratings. They were many times higher than FAKE NEWS @CNN   public is smart!  Donald J.

Trump is correct that more people watched Fox News than any other individual news station, but he is also correct that the public is smart. What he fails to realize is that the majority of the  smart  public didn t watch Fox.Mediaite reported Monday that during the peak coverage block of 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. EST, Fox News drew 8.77 million viewers. This may seem like a lot, but NBC brought in 5.90 million people, ABC attracted 4.90 million, CBS had about 4.65 million viewers, 2.61 million watched CNN, and 1.38 million tuned in to MSNBC.

9019, Check Out The New Dating Website That Caters Specifically To White Pride (IMAGES),"Let s just say that if you consider being white the best thing about yourself, you must live one sad, lonely, and pathetic life. One of these pathetic people apparently felt the need to create a  whites only  website to meet like-minded folk. And not just any website, a dating website.What is this dating website called?  Where White People Meet,  of course. Duh.Of course, they re not gonna just come out and say they re racist. They re just going to make the website, in the predominantly white state of Utah, and claim that it s just like any other dating website. Here s what it says in their  About Us!  section: We developed this dating website as an alternative to the other dating websites that cater to certain groups. We simply want to help people connect in a safe and fun online environment without costing them a ton of money. Enjoy! Except, who is it an alternative for? It looks as though, for just $4, it s an exclusive alternative for anti-gay white supremacists. It seems as though one can t search for a same-sex pairing, and the website doesn t state where it stands on polygamy.via WhereWhitePeopleMeet.com What s even more bizarre is the fact that they would advertise this  whites only  on billboards in Utah, a state that is 91.4 percent white. Is it really that hard to find other white singles in Utah? Chances are, if you run into a single person, they re going to be white. So, why bother, unless you just want to be a racist douchebag?West Valley billboard promotes Utah-based dating site geared toward white people: https://t.co/aiEKVRuMD8 pic.twitter.com/5PY1rs58pc  Salt Lake Tribune (@sltrib) December 31, 2015Of course, the website states that it has nothing to do with racism: I am sure some of you are wondering about the concept and need for a dating website titled  Where White People Meet.Com.  Our answer to that would be why not? There are various dating websites that promote and cater to just about every origin, race, religion and lifestyle out there. So again, why not  Where White People Meet.Com ? Basically, it s a  don t forget white people exist, too  website. Which is often code among white supremacists who feel they are being overrun by people born with more melanin in their skin. They have to make sure they are seen and heard. So, while they try to say things like: As you navigate the website and begin to interact with other members, please remember the golden rule of  treat others as you want to be treated.  The staff here at Where White People Meet will not tolerate rude, aggressive or racist behavior. The last thing we want it to have to remove a member of this community but please know that we will. They should be aware that creating a website in a nearly entirely white state to cater to only white people is pretty damn racist in and of itself. And while the NAACP has determined that it doesn t seem to be the work of a hate group, the whole thing just seems really weird and unnecessary. In fact, if this whole thing turned out to some satirical joke, it wouldn t at all be surprising. It s that weird.Featured image: WhereWhitePeopleMeet.com",News,"January 2, 2016"

15399,IVANA TRUMP SPEAKS OUT AGAINST LEFTIST RAG’S FALSE ACCUSATIONS OF EX DONALD “RAPING” HER,"Hmmm Ever wonder why the left fears Trump so much? The Daily Beast s Tim Mak and Brandon Zadrozny woke up on Tuesday to find that CNN completely embarrassed them. After publishing a more-than-1,700-word-long invective on Monday evening reprinting old and disproven allegations against GOP presidential frontrunner Donald Trump by his ex-wife in divorce proceedings Trump s ex-wife herself came out with a statement to CNN standing by her ex-husband, and discrediting the liberal outlet s hit piece which relied heavily on statements she made in divorce proceedings 30 years ago. I have recently read some comments attributed to me from nearly 30 years ago at a time of very high tension during my divorce from Donald. The story is totally without merit. Donald and I are the best of friends and together have raised three children that we love and are very proud of. I have nothing but fondness for Donald and wish him the best of luck on his campaign. Incidentally, I think he would make an incredible president,  Ivana Trump, Donald s ex-wife, said in the statement to CNN.Donald and Ivana Trump had three children together Ivanka, Eric and Donald, Jr., Donald s oldest children and now all officials at Trump s company three of Trump s five children.The embarrassing and quick putdown of the Daily Beast story comes just hours after the outlet ran a blistering headline falsely accusing him of rape:  Ex-Wife: Donald Trump Made Me Feel  Violated  During Sex. The sub-headline of the inaccurate article was even worse, directly leveling the false rape allegation:  Ivana Trump once accused the real-estate tycoon of  rape,  although she later clarified: not in the  criminal sense. The way they justified dredging up the three-decade-old allegation from divorce proceeding transcript, which was again per Ivana s statement to CNN clearly false? Donald Trump introduced his presidential campaign to the world with a slur against Mexican immigrants, accusing them of being  rapists  and bringing crime into the country.  Mak and Zadrozny wrote as the lead of their article before delving into the lurid, old and disproven details.  I mean somebody s doing it!  Who s doing the raping?  Donald Trump said, when asked to defend his characterization. It was an unfortunate turn of phrase for Trump in more ways than one. From there, they delve into the old allegations:  Not only does the current frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination have a history of controversial remarks about sexual assault, but as it turns out, his ex-wife Ivana Trump once used  rape  to describe an incident between them in 1989. She later said she felt  violated  by the experience. The incident did come up in the divorce proceedings transcripts and was first reported on widely and publicly by former Texas Monthly and former Newsweek reporter Harry Hurt III in his 1993 book:  Lost Tycoon: The Many Lives of Donald J. Trump. So, what did Mak and Zadrozny do? Bring the old story back up of course.For entire story: Breitbart News",politics,"Jul 28, 2015"

510, NYT Bombshell: Trump And McConnell Not Speaking; McConnell Questioning Trump’s GOP Future,"Donald Trump has never been Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell s (R-KY) favorite person. That uneasy relationship deteriorated further in recent days and weeks, as Trump proceeded to openly mock and humiliate McConnell, blaming him for everything from the failed attempts to repeal Obamacare to the entire situation of the fractured GOP s stalled agenda. Now, since Trump had such a disgraceful response to the white supremacist violence in Charlottesville that resulted in the death of anti-racism activist Heather Heyer and the injuries of countless others, it seems that Trump and McConnell are engaged in what the New York Times is calling their own little, quote,  cold war. According to the new bombshell report, Trump doesn t even talk to McConnell   the one most important man in the legislative branch when it comes to getting his agenda passed. The New York Times reports: The relationship between President Trump and Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, has disintegrated to the point that they have not spoken to each other in weeks, and Mr. McConnell has privately expressed uncertainty that Mr. Trump will be able to salvage his administration after a series of summer crises.What was once an uneasy governing alliance has curdled into a feud of mutual resentment and sometimes outright hostility.The article further suggests that when Trump and McConnell were speaking, Trump didn t just keep his taunts to the usual juvenile derision via Twitter. No, apparently, on August 9th, McConnell and Trump had some kind of conversation, and Trump could not help going after McConnell to his face. There are no details regarding exactly what was said, but knowing Trump, it was likely pretty scathing and humiliating for McConnell, who seems to consider himself your typical dignified grown man. He is likely simply done with Trump s playground bully behavior and is no longer going to dignify Trump s ignorance and taunts with responses.It also doesn t help that McConnell s wife, Elaine Chao, is Trump s Transportation Secretary. She is an immigrant, and arrived from Taiwan as a child, speaking no English. Under Trump s new immigration plans, she would never have been allowed into this country. Further, to top it all off, Secretary Chao had to be humiliated standing next to Trump during his Charlottesville tirade, in which he defended white supremacists. Think about that   how it must have made McConnell feel to see his wife being used that way in such a despicable, bigoted, and unhinged Trump rant.All of this has resulted in much more criticism than one would expect from Mitch McConnell in public, but, according to the Times, McConnell is much more angry with Trump than he is letting on, and he is even wondering if Trump will be the GOP s leader for much longer, given his recent behavior. Again, from the New York Times:Mr. McConnell has fumed over Mr. Trump s regular threats against fellow Republicans and criticism of Senate rules, and questioned Mr. Trump s understanding of the presidency in a public speech. Mr. McConnell has made sharper comments in private, describing Mr. Trump as entirely unwilling to learn the basics of governing.In offhand remarks, Mr. McConnell has expressed a sense of bewilderment about where Mr. Trump s presidency may be headed, and has mused about whether Mr. Trump will be in a position to lead the Republican Party into next year s elections and beyond, according to people who have spoken to him directly.All in all, those two might never speak again. The thing is, though, Donald Trump has severely underestimated Mitch McConnell s power. The GOP took a chance and hitched their wagon to this ignorant, incompetent orange fool because their voters left them no choice. However, they now clearly regret it   and said regret just might be inching toward hastening Trump s removal from office.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"August 22, 2017"
21563,"NEW DISCOVERY REVEALS BALTIMORE STATE’S ATTORNEY’S PARENTS WEREN’T MODEL COPS : Mom Received 20+ Disciplinary Actions, Dad Fired For Criminal Activity","Baltimore City State s Attorney Marilyn Mosby tells FOX News reporter during hostile exchange (at the 1 minute mark) that she comes from five generations of police officers in response to his statement that Baltimore Police officers are concerned she doesn t have their backs:  https://youtu.be/nbDeRqCxJbsThe mother of Baltimore city state s attorney Marilyn Mosby faced numerous disciplinary actions during her 20-year career as a Boston police officer, though the public wouldn t know it based on the Freddie Gray case prosecutor s public statements touting her family s strong policing history.The 35-year-old Mosby has used her family s police ties to rebut critics who say she rushed to judgement and overcharged the six cops involved in Gray s April 12 arrest. The 25-year-old Gray died a week later, touching off rioting in Baltimore and nationwide protests. Law enforcement is pretty much instilled within my being,  Mosby told MSNBC s Chris Hayes on May 1, the day she publicly announced charges against the officers.  I come from five generations of police officers,  she added, pointing out that her mother, father, grandfather and uncles have all served as cops.But there s more to the story than Mosby has let on.Personnel records obtained by The Daily Caller show that Mosby s mother, Linda Thompson, first violated the Boston police department s substance abuse policy in 2006. After serving a 45-day rehab stint, Thompson violated the drug code again and voluntarily resigned on Feb. 1, 2008, rather than be fired.The early retirement allowed Thompson, now 52, to draw a $1,810.69 monthly pension.Thompson is not the only member of Mosby s family to have had a rocky policing career. Mosby s father was fired from the Boston police department in 1991 following accusations that he and his partner robbed drug dealers at gun point. Mosby s uncle was fired from Boston PD in 2001 after testing positive for cocaine. Her grandfather was a well-respected Boston cop, but he ultimately and unsuccessfully sued the department for racial discrimination in the 1980s.Personnel records obtained by The Daily Caller show that Mosby s mother, Linda Thompson, first violated the Boston police department s substance abuse policy in 2006.

Mosby s uncle was fired from Boston PD in 2001 after testing positive for cocaine. Her grandfather was a well-respected Boston cop, but he ultimately and unsuccessfully sued the department for racial discrimination in the 1980s.Mosby has not publicly mentioned any of that during her speeches when running for Baltimore state s attorney or since taking on the Gray case. A majority of police officers are risking their lives day-in and day-out,  Mosby told Hayes during her interview.  Recognizing that, because that s what my family did, I also recognize that there are those individuals that usurp their authority who will go past the public trust. When they do that, you have to hold those individuals accountable,  Mosby added.Mosby s claims are disingenuous, say three retired Boston police officers interviewed by TheDC. Linda Thompson s daughter is lecturing police officers about the right thing to do? You ve got to be kidding me,  said one former cop who reached the highest levels of the Boston police department and has known Thompson since the beginning of her career.The retired officer, who asked not to be named, said that Mosby s message has been,  You can trust me, I come from a family of cops. Mosby has proved a polarizing figure so far in the Gray case. Elected to office last year, she became a national star to many after her public announcement of charges against the cops. But her many critics say her case is flimsy and that she charged the officers for political reasons.The prosecution s theory seems to be that the officers did not do enough to restrain Gray in the back of a police van after his April 12 arrest. Some of the six officers also failed to provide proper medical attention, Mosby has claimed.Gray s April 19 death was ruled a homicide due to  an act of omission.  Mosby charged the driver of Gray s police van with second-degree depraved heart murder and manslaughter. Three other cops face manslaughter charges.Mosby has also been heavily criticized for using activist rhetoric when publicly discussing the case. During her May 1 speech she said that she heard protesters  battle-cry of  no justice, no peace.  Days before that speech   and before the medical examiner s office had even determined Gray s cause of death   she told a group of local clergy members that she was going to seek justice for Gray  by any and all means necessary.

22475,Russian Military: US Coalition Predator Drone Spotted at Time & Place of Syria UN Aid Convoy Attack,"21st Century Wire says Despite proclamations by US official, details of the attack on the UN Aid Convoy yesterday are still sketchy. With no evidence to hand John Kerry and  unnamed  US officials claim that  they know  the Russian attacked the UN aid convoy passing through a  rebel  terrorist-held highway while travelling out of West Aleppo and heading southwest towards al-Foua and Kefraya villages. From the onset, both Russian and Syrian military stated they were not involved in this incident, but US maintain they are the guilty parties. John Kerry blaming Russia for mysterious attack on UN Convoy.The US insistence to blame Russia for attacking this UN Aid Convoy appears to be a desperate deflect-and-divert public relations move to mask the fact the Washington destroyed its own ceasefire agreement on Saturday when it massacred over 70 Syrian Army soldiers and wounding another 100, in a sustained one hour-long attack involving multiple aircraft from the US, UK, Australia and Denmark. Because of that US-led airstrike, ISIS was allowed to advance immediately forward towards taking the key strategic city of Deir al-Zour. In spite of the unlikely coincidence, Washington claimed this was all just  a mistake. In addition, US Coalition and Gulf-backed  rebel  terrorists had already broke the Russia-US ceasefire multiple times, and are also on record boasting earlier in the week how terrorist-held East Aleppo militants would refuse any UN aid convoy that crossed their sights.Did the US and its  rebel  forces on the ground orchestrate another false flag event designed to avoid condemnation of Saturday s massacre? Our western colleages are putting their best efforts to hype up the situation and  blur  the tragedy in Deir ez-Zor and to distract the international community from Al-Nusra s advance on Aleppo and thus cover the US incompetence in distinguishing between the  moderate  opposition and terrorists in Syria.    Russian spokeperson.Now, new evidence suggests that the US Coalition may be misleading the world about their true intentions  RTThe Russian Defense Ministry says that a US coalition drone was in the vicinity of a humanitarian convoy when it was attacked outside Aleppo. According to the Russian military, the unmanned aircraft was a Predator drone. On the evening of September 19, in that specific region, a drone belonging to the international condition, which had taken off from the Incirlik air base in Turkey, was flying at a height of 3,600 meters and traveling at around 200 kilometers per hour,  said Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov. The object was in the area around the town of Urm Al-Kubra, where the convoy was a few minutes before it caught fire,  Konashenkov added.  It left after about 30 minutes. The Defense Ministry spokesman said he wanted to point out that, as was the case with the tragedy on September 17 which saw US-led coalition airstrike kill and injure 200 people, the Russians would not be making any unfounded allegations. Only the owners know what exactly the drone was doing at this particular area at that exact time,  he added.Moscow says it has provided all the data it possesses regarding the attack on the convoy, which was carrying aid to rebel-held areas in Aleppo, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said at a UN Security Council meeting on Wednesday. There was another unacceptable provocation on September 19   the shelling of a humanitarian convoy near Aleppo,  he said.  I am confident that such coincidences require serious analysis and an investigation. On September 19, a humanitarian convoy consisting of 31 trucks was attacked while heading to Aleppo. According to the Red Cross, 20 civilians and one aid worker died as a result. Initial reports claimed the convoy had been targeted by an airstrike. Later the UN said all it could confirm was that the convoy was attacked.On Tuesday, the Russian Defense Ministry reiterated that neither it nor the Syrian military had launched airstrikes on the convoy. Russian and Syrian warplanes did not carry out any airstrikes on a UN humanitarian aid convoy in the southwest of Aleppo,  Konashenkov said in a statement. He added that the military had studied video footage of the convoy, which appeared to rule out that an airstrike took place. We have closely studied the video footage from where the incident took place and we did not find any signs of any ammunition having hit the convoy. There are no craters, while the vehicles have their chassis intact and they have not been severely damaged, which would have been the case from an airstrike,  Konashenkov said. All of the video footage demonstrates that the convoy caught fire, which strangely happened almost at exactly at the same time as militants started a large-scale offensive on Aleppo. In a statement Konashenkov said Moscow was compelled to disclose the  sensitive details  in response to the accusations made by US deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes, who has laid the blame for the attack on the aid convoy on Russia. This type of drone can not only monitor the situation, but also guide ground weapons to their targets and inflict surgical airstrikes at objects located on the ground by itself,  the Russian spokesman explained Read more at RTREAD MORE SYRIA NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Syria Files",US_News,"September 21, 2016"
9709,NEW YORK TIMES BUSTED: Undercover Video Exposes Editor for Bias Against Trump [Video],"Project Veritas  latest installment in the American Pravda series takes aim at The New York Times, the supposed  paper of record.  In the first part of this series, Nicholas Dudich, Audience Strategy Editor for the Times  extensive video library speaks candidly about how his left political bias influences his editorial judgement and reveals an unusual connection to former FBI Director James Comey, and a strange association with domestic terror group Antifa.Since this video came out, the New York Times released a statement saying they ve launched an investigation:This should have been done when hiring this former antifa thug who also worked for Clinton.RT reported:In the video, Dudich calls himself the  gatekeeper  for all the New York Times videos posted online, saying that his  imprint is on every video we do. Any video that goes on Facebook, YouTube, Instagram   I have a hand in that,  Dudich said.When talking journalistic ethics, Dudich is captured sarcastically making air quotes while he said that he will  be objective  working for the Times before quickly admitting:  no I m not. That s why I m there. According to the New York Times ethical handbook, employees  must do nothing that might raise questions about their professional neutrality or that of The Times. As a journalist, I m not able to give any money to any political organization. I m not able to volunteer for any political organization. I m not able to work for any nonprofit or charity. Like, there s a lot of guidelines and ethics,  Dudich said.However, before joining the Times, Dudich worked social media on the 2012 presidential campaign of former President Barack Obama and the 2016 presidential campaign of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.When asked how he was able to be politically active and still work as a journalist, Dudich said that he had to leave his job at ABC to take a job where he  wasn t deemed a journalist anymore  in order to work for the Clinton campaign.Dudich said he made the sacrifice in order to work against Trump, who he said was a  threat. I saw the threat and I was like, I want to do something,  Dudich said.  Trump was a threat and still is a threat, right? Trump is a threat,  the interviewer interjects.  He s a threat. Oh, he s a threat to everything,  Dudich added.Read more President/co-founder of The Dream Corps and CNN contributor Van Jones   Rich Polk CNN s Van Jones calls Russia  nothing burger  video  edited, right-wing propaganda  At one point, Dudich explains his idea to make Trump resign or leave office by going after his businesses and his  dumb f**k of a son, Donald Jr., and Eric.

If you can ruin the Trump brand and you put pressure on his business and you start investigating his business and you start shutting it down, or they re hacking or other things.

1810, Trump Attacks James Comey For Not Jailing Clinton: ‘She Was Guilty Of Every Charge’ (VIDEO),"In an interview with Fox Business that aired Tuesday, Donald Trump responded to news that the FBI had successfully obtained a FISA warrant to look into his former advisor Carter Page by trashing James Comey for not locking Hillary Clinton up. Sure, Clinton did not commit any crimes and was never charged with anything, but according to Trump she is GUILTY GUILTY GUILTY. When Jim Comey came out, he saved Hillary Clinton. He saved her life, Trump said, apparently forgetting that a certain letter from Comey helped swing the election his way. When he was reading those charges, she was guilty of every charge, and then he said she was essentially OK. Nevertheless, for some reason Trump says he trusts Comey to clear him with regard to Russia.Trump also complained that he is understaffed because of  obstructionist  Democrats and other things that prevent him from accomplishing what he wants   like  the law.  In reality, the problem is that The Donald isn t actually nominating people. Democrats have only  obstructed  when there was a legitimate objection, like that the person worked with Russia or is a white supremacist.Trump told Fox that he still believes he was correct when he accused President Obama of  tapping  his  wires  at Trump Tower because numerous members of his administration were and are under investigation by the FBI for their illegal activities (many involving Russia). While it is true that Trump Tower was monitored years ago, it had more to do with the Russian money laundering operation that was happening three floors below Trump s penthouse than anything else. Over 30 Russian mobsters were indicted as a result of the investigation.Watch the interview below:Featured image via screengrab",News,"April 12, 2017"

10570,REPORT: “TOXIC” MEGYN KELLY Just Got Bad News From FOX News After Disastrous Start At NBC,"Hello Megyn Kelly! Time for a little karma! Word on the street is that Megyn Kelly will not be  welcomed back  at FOX News even if she comes crawling back from NBC.She s had a rocky start at NBC with her Putin interview and now with the much-hyped Alex Jones interview. You d think the controversy surrounding her contentious interview with Jones would pump up the ratings but it didn t. Perhaps it s because she s become so unlikeable on camera with her snarky questioning and cold as ice demeanor.Even if she comes calling at FOX, it s a no go according to Breitbart news: After Kelly s controversial and much-hyped interview with Alex Jones tanked by again failing to beat out reruns of 60 Minutes and America s Funniest Home Videos, New York radio host Mark Simone tweeted on Monday that NBC is trying to unload Kelly and convince Fox News to take her back.But a high-ranking Fox News source told Breitbart News that there is  no way  Kelly could come back to the network. Quite simply, the source told Breitbart News, Kelly  would not be welcomed back.  Simone also suggested that if Kelly becomes more toxic and her ratings tank even more,  NBC will have to take her off the network,  and  if they are stuck with her, they ll give her an MSNBC show.  Before she bolted to NBC, Kelly anchored The Kelly File on Fox News. During the 2016 election cycle, Kelly won praise from mainstream media journalists when she tried to undercut Donald Trump during the first Republican presidential debate in August of 2015 in Cleveland, Ohio. She also gave  Never Trumpers  a forum on her primetime show to constantly slam Trump throughout the election cycle.And as the Daily Beast s Lloyd Grove noted, Kelly also  hastened Roger Ailes  forced resignation last July with her fateful decision to recount his misconduct to a team of lawyers hired by 21st Century Fox to investigate allegations made in the sexual harassment and retaliation lawsuit filed by Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson.  New York magazine s Gabriel Sherman reported that Kelly  told investigators that Ailes made unwanted sexual advances toward her about ten years ago when she was a young correspondent at Fox. As Grove pointed out, Kelly, in her book, said there was some  poetic justice  in the role she played in helping boot Ailes out of Fox News. I worked my tail off  I established myself as a serious person,  Kelly wrote.  I built my own power. And when the allegations against Roger hit, I used it. Perhaps there is some poetic justice in that. NBC reportedly invested nearly $20 million a year to bring Kelly to the network, and NBC s investment has not paid any dividends at all. After her interview with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Kelly was mocked for being way out of her league. And when HuffPost obtained the full unedited interview in which a  nervous  Kelly lobbed Putin  softballs,  Kelly was subjected to another round of criticism.Her interview with Jones did not have any news value and may have damaged NBC s and her reputation more than it helped.You know what they say about KARMA it s a B*tch!Read more: Breitbart News",politics,"Jun 20, 2017"
2750, It Took A Scathing Letter From Canada’s Prime Minister To Make Fox News FINALLY Correct Fake Story,"Fox News couldn t wait to try to spin the Quebec mosque attack. Jumping on early reports, Fox tweeted yesterday,  Suspect in Quebec mosque terror attack was of Moroccan origin, reports show.  Well, this turned out not to be the case at all. In fact, the shooter was actually a white man who had quietly become a Trump-loving right-wing extremist.However, Fox never bothered to take down the post once the truth became clear. I mean, a right-wing nutjob shooting up a mosque hardly helps convince their  poorly educated  viewers that every Muslim is a terrorist, now does it?

5145, U.S. Nazi Party Leader: Trump’s Campaign Is A ‘Real Opportunity’ For White Nationalist (AUDIO),"More proof that Donald Trump s presidential campaign is helping the fascist arm of the right-wing has just come in. During the July broadcast of his radio program, Rocky Suhayda, the chairman of the American Nazi Party declared that Trump s campaign is a  real opportunity for people like white nationalists. Not only does Suhayda think that Trump presents an opportunity to build new, politically active white nationalist coalitions, he also believes that Trump will win the election in November for  various reasons.  Suhayda believes that the  enemy  is in for a real surprise: I m gonna project, that I believe that Trump is going to win the election this November, for various reasons which I don t want to go into again. I think it s gonna surprise the enemy, because, I think that they feel that the white working class, especially the male portion of the working class, and with him, his female counterparts have basically thrown in the towel. Given up hope of any politician again standing up for their interests. Suhayda then goes on to say that it is time for an American Nazi political caucus to form in Congress. He also urges his followers to adopt the guise of being  pro-white  rather than overtly racist against minorities. Now, if Trump does win, okay, it s going to be a real opportunity for people like white nationalists, acting intelligently to build upon that, and to go and start   you know how you have the black political caucus and what not in Congress, and, everything, to start building on something like that, okay. It doesn t have to be anti, like the movement s been for decades, so much as it has to be pro-white. It s kinda hard to go and call us bigots if we don t go around and act like a bigot. That s what the movement should contemplate. Alright. Trump has received support from the worst-of-the-worst within the white nationalist and white supremacist movements. It s ridiculous to think that Trump might actually win the presidency this November. Poll after poll shows Democratic challenger Hillary Clinton winning the election. That being said, Trump s campaign itself is being used as a  conversation starter  for the KKK to recruit new members, according to the Washington Post.Trump s campaign is dangerous for the United States. Republicans who support him are supporting white supremacist movements. Well, more so than they already tacitly do through racist policy decisions.

20386,WOW! Suppression Of FREE SPEECH And GUN CONTROL For 2nd Graders Upheld By Circuit Court Judge,"Americans need to know that gun control is not just an issue leftist legislators are pushing.  Educators  and school administrators are making it clear that even the suggestion or thought of a gun by students, regardless of age, is evil and will be punished. When this story first came out in the news, we thought it had to be fake. Once we realized it was a real story and that a 2nd grader had actually been suspended for chewing a pop-tart into the shape of a gun, we applauded his father for taking the matter to court. We assumed any reasonable judge would rule against the irresponsible parties involved in their reckless decision to suspend this 7 year old boy, and that the boy s suspension would be reversed. Were we ever wrong The suspension of second grader who chewed his breakfast pastry into the shape of a gun was upheld by a circuit court judge last week.Joshua Welch was suspended from Anne Arundel County s Park Elementary in March 2013 after chewing his pastry into the shape of a gun and  [pretending] to fire it.  The student s father, B.J.

Anne Arundel County Schools reacted to the ruling by releasing a statement which said,  We have believed from the outset that the actions of the school staff were not only appropriate and consistent, but in the best interests of all students. Welch family attorney Robin Ficker lamented the ruling and pointed out there was  no violence, no real weapon, no ammunition.  But the suspension will now  be on [Joshua s] record in school  every time he goes into a new grade. Via: Breitbart News",left-news,"Jun 22, 2016"
319, Zuckerberg Was Personally Warned About Russian Meddling By Obama And He Completely Blew It Off,"As the investigations into how Russia meddled in our election escalate, Facebook has turned records relating to ad buys from Russian actors over to Congress. Facebook has found itself in the crosshairs of Democrats and Republicans alike because of this (and for other reasons), and Mark Zuckerberg is finally, finally wondering if maybe he should be taking a more active role in his own company.Why? Because Facebook sold over 3,000 pro-Trump and pro-right wing ads to fake accounts run by Russians and people with ties to Russia. They turned those records over to the House and Senate Intelligence Committees and to Special Counsel Robert Mueller. They re going to re-evaluate the processes they use to review political ads, and they will supposedly  offer a higher standard of transparency  on those ads than what the law requires for radio, television and other platforms.For many, it s too little, too late, though. Trump was elected, a hostile foreign power helped him win, and the true scope of how Russia used and manipulated Facebook is still unknown. When they first came under fire for allowing the proliferation of fake news following Trump s  win,  Zuckerberg s excuse was that they were a technology company, not a media company. The implication was that they couldn t be held responsible for any of that.They re only now starting to come around to the truth, but the sad thing about this is that Zuckerberg was warned about people misusing his platform to swing the election several times. In fact, none other than President Obama himself literally pulled Zuckerberg aside during a conference in Peru to practically beg him to take the threat of fake news and disinformation seriously. Obama told Zuckerberg that, unless he actually paid attention, this would only be worse in four years.But Zuckerberg blew him off. He told Obama that such messages weren t widespread on his platform, and that there wouldn t be an easy solution to it. Like his pathetic excuse of being a tech company, Zuckerberg shirked any and all responsibility for it. Obama tried. Zuckerberg didn t really seem to care.Discovering that another country would even dare to try and influence our elections should be a horrific epiphany for any American. It s true that neither Zuckerberg, nor anyone else at Facebook (or anyone really) could have sufficiently predicted that anything like this would happen. As recently as two to three years ago, most of us would have made fun of the conspiracy theorists making bizarre claims about shady and hostile foreign actors working to swing our elections to their favor. That s reality now, but early warnings like Obama s seem to have slid right off Zuckerberg s back, as he was more concerned with his product than with how his product was being misused.Russia weaponized Facebook, and it s not over. Facebook has its part to do and they need to get to it post-haste. But another part may lie with Washington, with our lawmakers. It may well be time to apply laws similar to those that govern political advertising elsewhere to social media. Facebook hasn t yet provided many details about how they ll be transparent, especially given the fact that many of their political ads don t meet current legal definitions for political ads. They are, however, talking the talk. Now they need to walk the walk, or be forced to do so under law.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"September 25, 2017"
17535,THE LIST of 34 House Republicans DEMANDING Permanent AMNESTY For Obama’s DACA “Kids”,"Who wants to deport  Dreamers ? Not many people, it turns out. Even veteran immigration restrictionists seem willing to legalize this subset of immigrants in the country illegally if it is part of a package deal. That s true even though a lot of what s said about the DACA recipients is PR-style hooey.For example, it s often said   indeed, former President Barack Obama just recently said   that the approximately 800,000 of them were  brought to this country by their parents.  Well, many were. But that s not required to qualify as a protected Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program recipient under the various plans, including Obama s. You just have to have entered the country illegally before age 16. You could have decided to sneak in against your parents  wishes. You re still a  Dreamer! Likewise, we re told DACA recipients are college-bound high school grads or military personnel. That s an exaggeration. All that s actually required is that the person enroll in a high school course or an  alternative,  including online courses and English-as-a-second-language classes. Under Obama s now-suspended program, you didn t even have to stay enrolled.Compared with the general population, DACA recipients are not especially highly skilled. A recent survey for several pro- Dreamer  groups, with participants recruited by those groups, found that while most DACA recipients are not in school, the vast majority work. But their median hourly wage is only $15.34, meaning that many are competing with hard-pressed lower-skilled Americans.The DACA recipients you read about have typically been carefully selected for their appeal. They re valedictorians. They re first responders. They re curing diseases. They root for the Yankees. They want to serve in the Army. If DACA recipients are the poster children for the much larger population of immigrants in the country illegally, these are the poster children for the poster children.  Chicago Tribune34 Republicans in Congress are not about to let the pesky facts about Obama s  Dreamers  get in the way of lobbying Speaker Ryan to grant them permanent citizenship.Numbers USA reports  Thirty-four Republicans in the House of Representatives signed a letter to House Speaker Paul Ryan calling for passage of a permanent DACA amnesty before the end of the year. Reps. Scott Taylor (R-Va.) and Dan Newhouse (R-Wash.) led the effort.While the lawmakers stop short of demanding passage of a DACA amnesty before the end of the year or including an amnesty in this month s must-pass spending bill, they don t insist on any other immigration-related provisions that would stop future flows of illegal immigration by calling for mandatory E-Verify or to reduce the numerical impact of the amnesty by calling for an end to Chain Migration.The letter reads:Dear Speaker Ryan,We write in support of passing of a permanent legislative solution for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients before the end of the year. DACA recipients   young people brought to America through no fault of their own   are contributing members of our communities and our economy. For many, this is the only country they have ever known. They are American in every way except their immigration status.Since DACA s inception, the federal government has approved approximately 795,000 initial DACA applications and 924,000 renewals. Since being approved for DACA status, an overwhelming majority of these individuals have enrolled in school, found employment, or have served in the military. Studies have shown that passing legislation to permanently protect these individuals would add hundreds of billions to our country s gross domestic product (GDP). That is why the business community, universities, and civic leaders alike support a permanent legislative solution.We agree with President Trump that executive action was not the appropriate process for solving this issue, as was done under the previous administration, and we believe Congress should act. We are compelled to act immediately because many DACA recipients are about to lose or have already lost their permits in the wake of the program s rescission. Not acting is creating understandable uncertainty and anxiety amongst immigrant communities.While we firmly believe Congress must work to address other issues within our broken immigration system, it is imperative that Republicans and Democrats come together to solve this problem now and not wait until next year. We all agree that our border must be enforced, our national security defended, and our broken immigration system reformed, but in this moment, we must address the urgent matter before us in a balanced approach that does not harm valuable sectors of our economy nor the lives of these hard-working young people. We must pass legislation that protects DACA recipients from deportation and gives them the opportunity to apply for a more secured status in our country as soon as possible. Reaching across the aisle to protect DACA recipients before the holidays is the right thing to do.Here s the list of 34 Republicans who need to be drained from the swamp:Rep. Scott Taylor (VA-2) Rep.

I ve always been confused about my gender identity,  Jenner tearfully said at the beginning of the two-hour special, which was partially filmed inside of his home.Bruce told Sawyer he has always known he was different and believes he has  the soul of a female.  At one point, the former Associated Press Male Athlete of the Year was known for his chiseled physique, but he said his brain is more female than male and that his entire life has been lived as a lie. I am a woman,  he stated. Although he identifies himself as female, Jenner feels a woman can still  kick butt.  He also explained,  It s not like I ve been dressing up like a woman, it s like I ve spent my whole life dressing like a man. While walking Sawyer through his childhood, Jenner described himself as a lonely little boy growing up, who often cross-dressed in order to fight confusion regarding his gender identity. He eventually grew up to be a  lonely big boy. The reality TV star also made it clear that sexuality is separate from gender:  I ve always felt heterosexual  I ve never been with a guy. He is still unsure if his next relationship will be with a man or woman and explained he considers himself  asexual  as of now, and at his current age is more concerned with finally living under his true identity.Speculation about Jenner s changing appearance has heated up over the past year, but the 65-year-old also revealed that at one point in the early eighties he started taking hormones but lost his nerve after five years. Due to the hormones, he actually developed size-36B breasts.In addition to starting hormone treatment 30 years ago, Bruce also started changing his face with a series of cosmetic procedures and removed the hair on his face and chest with electrolysis. He claimed that two of his three ex-wives, Linda Thompson and Kris Jenner, were both aware of his secret, and it played a part in ending his marriages.Jenner explained he was also once caught wearing a dress by stepdaughter Kim Kardashian and later by daughters Kendall and Kylie, after he was captured on a computer spy cam in Kylie s bedroom. After a talk from Kanye West, he said Kim became more accepting of his transition.WATCH THE INTERVIEW HERE: Among the more surprising revelations, Bruce told his guest he is both a Christian and a Republican. He admitted he has at times been concerned his lifestyle puts him at odds with the Bible in particular, the book of Deuteronomy, which classifies a man dressing as a woman as sin. I would sit in church and always wonder,  In God s eyes, how does he see me?    Maybe this is my cause in life   This is why God put me on this earth  to deal with this issue. When asked about President Obama s support for LGBT rights during the State of the Union, the former Olympian admitted he is not a big fan of Obama. I ve always been more on the conservative side,  he said.A puzzled Sawyer asked him if he identifies as a Republican, to which Jenner answered,  Yeah. Is that a bad thing? I believe in the Constitution. While he admitted he has at times had moderate suicidal thoughts, he now feels great about ridding himself of the anxieties of hiding his identity from his children and others.His four older children also spoke to Sawyer during the interview and all showed their support. His son Brandon said:  I feel like I m getting an upgraded version of my dad. His son Brody said of him coming out:  It finally makes sense. Jenner has been taking hormones again for a year and a half now but has not yet made a decision about full gender reassignment surgery. If this is the only problem I have in life, I ve got it made,  he told Sawyer.  In the next house, I m building a glam room. The interview was a  farewell to Bruce Jenner,  according to Sawyer, but Bruce explained he wasn t necessarily saying goodbye but rather:  I m saying goodbye to people s perceptions of me  I m just doing what I have to do. I m going to learn a lot in the next year,  Jenner added.  2015 is going to be quite a ride. Sawyer then teased that she may again catch up with the TV star for an additional interview in a year.Via: Breitbart News",left-news,"Apr 26, 2015"
1707, WATCH: Republican Heartlessly Tells A Mother That If Her Son Wants Healthcare He Should Get A Better Job,"Wow. The cruelty of Republicans knows no bounds.Apparently, Republicans truly believe that healthcare is a privilege that only people with money should be able to receive.That s basically what Ohio GOP Rep. Warren Davidson told a mother who expressed her concern that her son won t have healthcare coverage if Republicans repeal the Affordable Care Act.The woman s son works in the service industry, which usually does not provide health insurance to workers. Pay is also low enough that workers qualify for Medicaid, a program that Republicans fiercely oppose because it benefits low-income Americans.Prior to the passage of the Affordable Care Act, her son did not have health insurance. He, like millions of other Americans, could not afford it. But the Medicaid expansion finally gave him the healthcare coverage he desperately needed. Now that is being threatened by Donald Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress. Can you explain why my son and millions of others in his situation are not deserving of affordable, decent health care that has essential benefits so that he can stay healthy and continue working?  the mother asked Davidson at a town hall event on Tuesday.Davidson responded by giving a heartless answer that resulted in a round of boos and jeers from the crowd in attendance. OK, I don t know anything about your son, but as you described him, his skills are focused in an industry that doesn t have the kind of options that you want him to have for health care. So, I don t believe that these taxpayers here are entitled to give that to him. I believe he s got the opportunity to go earn those health benefits. First of all, service industry workers pay taxes, too. So they have every right to be covered by Medicaid. Second, healthcare is a right that everyone should have regardless of where they work or what industry they work in. Third, there are not enough of the kind of jobs Davidson is talking about to provide everyone in this country with workplace-provided healthcare coverage benefits. And finally, if Davidson and his Republican colleagues got off their asses and passed a law requiring the multi-billion dollar service industry to provide healthcare to their workers or pay their workers enough so they can afford to buy good health insurance plans themselves, this woman s son and millions of others would not have to live in fear of losing their coverage.But Davidson literally told this woman to tell her son to get a different job. And he dug the hole deeper for himself by compare health insurance to cell phones. If he doesn t want a catastrophic care plan, don t buy a catastrophic care plan. If you don t want a flip-phone, don t buy a flip-phone,  Davidson said. Once again, the crowd reacted in total disgust.Buying a cell phone is NOT the same as buying health insurance, and it s time for Republicans to that through their thick skulls.Health insurance costs hundreds of dollars a month or more while a cell phone payment plan is relatively cheap.In response to Davidson s remark, the woman snapped back and then walked away with the knowledge that her own congressman doesn t give a damn about her or her family. I m sorry, health care is much different than a cell phone and I m tired of people using cell phone analogies with health care,  she said.Here s the video via YouTube.

15994,BROTHER OF SETH RICH Works For Cyber Security Firm…Reportedly BLOCKED Family’s Private Investigator From Determining If Seth Was Wikileaks Source…Refused To Let Investigator See Seth’s Computer: “I already checked it…Don’t worry about it”,"What the heck is going on? Why is the media, who has been virtually silent about former DNC staffer Seth Rich s death until now, coming out to attack President Trump and his administration, accusing them of pushing a false narrative about his murder? Shouldn t every American regardless of political affiliation want to get to the bottom of Rich s suspicious death? Why is there so much secrecy and mystery surrounding the staffer who was getting ready to move over to the Hillary campaign when he was murdered on the streets of DC, only blocks from his home early in the morning, after he was last seen leaving a local bar he frequented. The DC police called it a robbery. The  robbers  didn t take his wallet, the contents of his wallet or his expensive watch.Aaron Rich, who had reportedly been blocking his family s private investigator from looking into whether or not his brother Seth was a WikiLeaks source, works for an influential defense contractor that provides cyber security.According to a source close to the Rich family, Aaron works for Northrup Grumman, which was named as the fifth-largest defense contractor in the world in 2015. The source did not provide what his specific role is at the company. It s not just hacking and defending, there s a lot more to it,  a cyber software engineer at Northrup Grumman says in a video on the company s website.As we previously reported, Aaron Rich was actively attempting to shut down anyone looking into the WikiLeaks connection according to Rod Wheeler, who was brought on as a private investigator in his brother s murder case.Wheeler said that brother Aaron Rich tried to block Wheeler from looking at Seth s computer, even though there could be evidence on it.  He said no, he said I have his computer, meaning him,  Wheeler said.  I said, well can I look at it? He said, what are you looking for? I said anything that could indicate if Seth was having problems with someone. He said no, I already checked it. Don t worry about it. Aaron also blocked Wheeler from finding out about who was at a party Seth attended the night of the murder. All I want you to do is work on the botched robbery theory and that s it,  Aaron told Wheeler, according to Wheeler s claim on the audio. Wheeler said that Seth s father Joel  does not appear to have any hidden agenda. Rich was shot in the back in the early morning hours of July 10, 2016, near his home while he was on the phone with his girlfriend   12 days before the publication of the DNC emails by WikiLeaks. The police initially ruled that it was a botched robbery   but his wallet, watch, and necklace were still on his person when he was discovered by police.Big League Politics has also released an audio recording of journalist Seymour Hersh stating that Seth Rich was in fact WikiLeaks  source.Listen to the Seymour Hersh interview here: All I know is that he offered a sample, an extensive sample, I m sure dozens of emails, and said  I want money.  Later, WikiLeaks did get the password, he had a DropBox, a protected DropBox,  he said. They got access to the DropBox. Hersh also states that Rich had concerns about something happening to him,  the word was passed, according to the NSA report, he also shared this DropBox with a couple of friends, so that  if anything happens to me it s not going to solve your problems,  he added.  WikiLeaks got access before he was killed. For entire story: Big League Politics ",Government News,"Aug 2, 2017"
5533, WATCH: President Obama Dares Republicans To Support Gun Control To Prove They Care About Cop Safety,"Conservatives talk the talk but can they walk the walk?That s exactly what President Obama dared them to do during a press conference in Warsaw, Poland on Saturday when he asked them to prove they truly care about the lives of police officers by supporting common sense gun measures to make the jobs of cops easier and safer.Republicans have repeatedly blamed President Obama and Black Lives Matter for the killing of five police officers in Dallas, Texas all while professing their own love of police officers and concern for their safety.President Obama told reporters that police have a tough job to do and made it clear that the actions of the Dallas shooter should not be assumed to be supported by all black people just as people did not blame all white people for the Charleston church shooting in South Carolina. When some white kid walks into a church and shoots a bunch of worshipers who invite him to worship with them we don t assume somehow he s making a political statement that s relevant to the attitudes of the rest of America. And we shouldn t make those assumptions about a troubled Muslim individual who is acting on their own in that same way. President Obama then moved on to speak about guns and the role they play in these tragedies. I am going to keep talking about the fact that we cannot eliminate all racial tension in our country overnight. We are not going to be able to identify ahead of time and eliminate every madman or troubled individual who might want to do harm against innocent people. But we can make it harder for them to do so. President Obama mentioned the harrowing number of gun violence incidents that have occurred in this country for the last ten years, pointing out that there is a  pattern  of gun violence that makes America  unique in the scale of violence that we experience  including mass shootings and gun murders we mostly consider  routine.  President Obama mentioned his hometown of Chicago as an example.President Obama then made a connection between all of these shootings and the lack of gun restrictions that make it harder for people officers to do their jobs. Part of what s creating tensions between communities and the police is the fact that police have a really difficult time in communities where they know guns are everywhere,  he said before using Dallas as an example because protesters participating in the rally that night exercised their right to open carry because Texas is an open-carry state. Because of all the guns around, the confused police initially had trouble figuring out who was shooting at them, even aiming their guns at the crowd before discovering where the shots were really coming from.With that said, President Obama challenged Republicans to put their money where their mouth is and treat guns as a contributing factor to gun violence if they really care about the lives of police as they claim: If you care about the safety of our police officers, then you can t set aside the gun issue and pretend that s irrelevant We can t just ignore that and pretend that that s somehow political or the president is just pushing his policy agenda. It s a contributing factor, not the sole factor, but a contributing factor to the broader tensions that arise between police and the communities where they serve There is a way to talk about that that is consistent with our Constitution and the Second Amendment. The problem is even mention of it somehow evokes this kind of polarization between a very intense minority and a majority of Americans who think we could do better when it comes to gun safety. Here s the video via Youtube.Conservatives want everyone to believe that there is a war between cops and black people, probably because they are hoping for one so the NRA and gun industry can make more money selling guns to every person they successfully scare with their bullshit. But the fact is that if the Dallas shooter had not had access to a high-powered assault rifle, there would be more police officers alive today. But Republicans refuse to do anything that would tighten gun restrictions in this country even though such restrictions could reduce gun violence and save lives, including the lives of police officers who have to work in these guns everywhere states wondering who is going to open fire next.Featured image via screenshot",News,"July 9, 2016"
11166,“SENIOR U.S. OFFICIAL” Releases Damaging Information On Russian Involvement In Syria Gas Attack,"This is very curious! The AP is reporting a story from a  Senior U.S. Official  on Russia s involvement in the Syria gas attack. This official is saying that the we have evidence that Russia knew about the chemical weapon attack before it happened. This Associated Press report is interesting for a couple of reasons. Is the release of this information by a Senior U.S. Official an effort to embarrass Rex Tillerson or cause trouble for his trip to Russia?Tillerson will be in Russia in 36 hours so this will only add to the tension. Could this actually be the strategy of the Trump administration to give the upper hand to the U.S.?WASHINGTON (AP)   A senior U.S. official says the United States has concluded that Russia knew in advance of Syria s chemical weapons attack last week.The official says a Russian-operated drone flew over a hospital in Syria as victims of the attack were rushing to get treatment.Hours after the drone left, a Russian-made fighter jet bombed the hospital in what American officials believe was an attempt to cover up the usage of chemical weapons.Until Monday, U.S. officials had said they weren t sure if the drone was operated by Russia or Syria. The senior official said it still wasn t clear who was flying the jet that bombed the hospital.The official said the presence of the drone couldn t have been a coincidence, and that Russia must have known the chemical weapons attack was coming and that victims were seeking treatment.The official wasn t authorized to speak publicly on intelligence matters and demanded anonymity.

Bones jokingly volunteered to serve as Senator Rock s  Secretary of Useless Information. Kid Rock has announced voter registration drives but has yet to declare his candidacy for the US Senate.

During that interview, it s clear that Bob Ritchie, aka Kid Rock, who is a rock star in more ways that one in the state of Michigan, has many similarities to President Donald Trump.Piers Morgan starts out his interview by pointing out that after he and Kid Rock spent several hours together during his interview, when Rock was asked about his time with Piers, he responded,  Who the (bleep) is Piers Morgan? , giving the impression that the leftist media doesn t really have much value in his eyes, or at the very least, he doesn t hold them in very high regard.Watch:Part II of Kid Rock s interview with Piers Morgan delves into Rock s political views on gun control, abortion, gay marriage and his support for the Republican Party. Although his pro-choice stance won t likely resonate with many Republicans, there will be a number of pro-choice Republicans as well as crossover Democrats and pro-life Independents his pro-choice stance will appeal to.

5010, You Really Don’t Want To Miss Ana Navarro PUMMEL Trump’s Chief Racism Apologist (VIDEO),"When it comes to Donald Trump and his number of apologists sent out to every media outlet to justify his horrific behavior, the media has been less than extraordinary at calling out their utter bullsh*t.However, leave it to Ana Navarro, notably a conservative, to absolutely rip Trump s number one apologist apart during a recent segment on CNN.Former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski is now a regular commentator on CNN.  Remember that the next time Trump wants to say the media has a liberal bias. Lewandowski decided he would defend Trump s racism and awful remarks, and Navarro clearly has had just about enough of his shenanigans.Navarro, laying it all out on the table, brilliantly came back at Lewandowski and said: I will tell you something. I will take credit for insulting him. Because he s been insulting communities since the first day he launched his campaign, when he started talking about Mexican rapists   The reason I can call Donald Trump names and I can insult him back is because I am the sister of a disabled man and he mocked that disabled man, because I am the friend of a POW and he mocked that POW, because I m an immigrant and he has insulted immigrants, because I m a Hispanic and he has insulted Hispanics, because I am a woman and he has insulted women. So, yeah, we re at the point where there s insults and name-calling. But I would just say that he threw that rock first. He is the one who has lowered the debate to the level that it is at. However, honestly, my favorite part is when Lewandowski tried to go after Navarro personally trying to discredit her own experience, because this is what Trump and his lackeys do, and she swung back with: Oh, Corey, do me a favor, before you go attacking me   oh, let me tell you something, let me play my little violin for you. Ha!As it s long been said, the moment you need to enter into personal attacks and not just attacks on policy, you have already lost. Both Trump and his lemmings, including Lewandowski, are nothing but losers who resort to just insulting people because that s honestly all they have.

20469,ITALIANS FURIOUS! Have You Ever Dreamed Of Living FREE OF CHARGE In A 4-Star Seaside Resort In Italy?…Become A Refugee And You Can!,"One short trip on a boat and this could be all yours! No papers required A group of local citizens from the Italian Island of Sicily have denounced a recent political decision to turn a 4-star seaside resort into the latest migrant welcome center, near the historic city of Agrigento. The hotel Capo Rossello Realmonte is located just a short distance from the Scala dei Turchi, or  Turkish Steps,  an unusual white, rocky cliff popular with tourists that has also been proposed for the UNESCO Heritage list.The Region of Sicily, led by governor Rosario Crocetta of the Democratic Party, has decided to transform the hotel into a hub where asylum-seekers will be accommodated, theoretically just for 48 hours for registration purposes before being transferred to other centers or possible repatriation. Critics have noted that the migrants and refugees will actually be staying considerably longer, judging from the way such centers work elsewhere in Italy.The local City Council of Realmonte, chaired by Mayor Calogero Zicari has joined a local citizens  movement in collecting signatures protesting the plan to convert the hotel into a migrant center.The mayor told local media that since the area depends on tourism, the proposal would have  a major impact on the economy,  recalling that the arrival of large groups of migrants in other areas has destroyed investments that had been developed over years. We are angry and worried by this latest irresponsible decision,  said Angelo Attaguile, the local leader of the Noi con Salvini populist political party. Some people forget that we are talking about a site with enormous touristic value, which was recently nominated as a UNESCO Heritage site, and which could be jeopardizes by this foolish decision,  Attaguile said. We cannot accept that top-tier hotel facilities, close to the sea and tourist destinations like the Scala Dei Turchi, continue to be turned into reception centers,  he added.Another political operative from the Noi con Salvini party, Giuseppe Di Rosa, has accused politicians in office of reaping economic benefits from public funds coming in for the construction and operation of refugee centers. They are transforming our land into a mega hotel that houses refugees of all kinds without any sanitary control of the territory,  he said. -Via: Bretibart News ",left-news,"Jun 6, 2016"

8734, ‘Shoot Hillary In The F*ckin Head’: Conservatives Freak Out Over Benghazi Movie,"The new movie about the attack on the U.S. facility in Benghazi, Libya, is stirring up conservatives and their now legendary hatred of Hillary Clinton.Gawker writer Christopher Hooks went to the premiere of Michael Bay s 13 Hours at the Dallas Cowboys stadium in Arlington, Texas. After interviewing some of the attendees, he came back with a report on the intense Clinton hate that the movie had activated. It wasn t pretty.Certainly, the people who d come to the stadium because they didn t like Clinton felt fired up after seeing it.  She s a piece of shit,  said one man who declined to give his name and didn t make eye contact.  But I already knew she s a piece of shit. I hope it defeats Hillary,  said another, Don Lochran.  They covered the whole thing up.  It was Lochran who then suggested bombing them all.Others were less sanguine.  Oh yeah. I d shoot Hillary Clinton in the fuckin  head. I don t like the bitch at all,  said Len Toomey, who identified himself as a veteran of Desert Storm and Somalia. He d seen the movie with some VFW friends.  Choke her. She should be in the pisser and I should be pissin  on her every night. Whether you back Clinton or not, the abject misogyny and hate that base conservatives have for her is grotesque to behold. About the only thing rivaling it in intensity is their hatred for President Obama.To many factions of the right   and those are often the same people yelling the loudest for Donald Trump s white power presidential campaign   the former Secretary of State and First Lady is the absolute devil incarnate.In this go-around they erroneously believe she and the President left men to die in Benghazi, when in fact real life is NOT like an action movie and forces were constrained by the reality of time and space in how they could respond. Even so, they did eventually get on the scene, something conservatives leave out of their Benghazi storytelling.13 Hours is unlikely to change anyone s minds pro or con with Clinton, but it at least is serving a purpose in once again putting on display just how hateful the right can be without even trying that hard.Featured image via Paramount Pictures",News,"January 15, 2016"
9817,WOW! TOP SPONSORS OF NFL Issue Statements About National Anthem Protests,"Despite massive boycott threats by consumers, at least 3 major sponsors of the NFL have come out in support of players disrespecting our flag and our veterans. NFL players have joined the now unemployed 49 ers QB Colin Kaepernick to take a knee on the field during our national anthem as a way to show support for the Black Lives Matter anti-cop movement. The protest exploded over the weekend when President Trump spoke out against the disrespect NFL players are showing for our flag, turning the protest into an anti-Trump protest for players who many believe are still angry that Trump won the election, defeating the seriously flawed Democrat candidate, Hillary Clinton.Ford Motor Co., Armour Inc., and Anheuser-Busch InBev SA issued statements that affirmed NFL players  rights to kneel during the pre-game national anthem, while also sounding patriotic notes and affirming their support for the flag.Ford Motor Co, one of the biggest sponsors of the NFL just revealed that they are supporting the national anthem protests.

Ford Motor Co chairman Martha Firestone Ford took her support for the players anti-cop, Black Lives Matter and anti-President Trump protests one step further when she joined her players on the field and linked arms with her daughters. The tangled responses are the latest version of the challenges faced by corporations in a world in which the president makes public demands and denouncements of companies via Twitter.

7616, Benjamin Netanyahu Just Snubbed Obama AGAIN – And In The Scummiest Way Possible,"It s no secret that there is little love lost between President Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, but this is ridiculous.Somehow unsatisfied by his pathetic use of an unprecedented speech delivered to Congress at the behest of the Republican Party in an attempt derail sensitive Iranian nuclear negotiations, Netanyahu has found a new low. Out of the blue, and with no official statement to the White House, Netanyahu cancelled a trip to Washington and a meeting with the president. The Pope met with the President. The Denver Broncos met with the President. A 106-year-old lady danced with the President. But Netanyahu, a supposed American  ally  in the Middle East will snub him in what is likely the pair s last opportunity to meet face-to-face.Netanyahu didn t even attempt to hide his contempt for Obama, either. Rather than do the respectable thing and give the White House a heads up, the president and his staff learned of Netanyahu s snub from  media outlets like CNN.The White House said Israel had proposed two dates for a meeting between the leaders and the U.S. had offered to meet on one of those days.  We were looking forward to hosting the bilateral meeting,  said Ned Price, a spokesman for the White House s National Security Council.  We were surprised to first learn via media reports that the prime minister, rather than accept our invitation, opted to cancel his visit. Classy.According to Israeli news networks, insiders in the Netanyahu administration told reporters that he was  unwilling to meet with Obama.  However, the Israeli government publicly disputed those reports.Ironically, Netanyahu s own defense for cancelling was so that he did not sway the upcoming U.S. election   something he didn t mind doing in the past. For instance, Netanyahu spoke with Obama on Super Tuesday in 2012. He didn t seem concerned that his actions would throw a wrench in the Democratic process   or perhaps more accurately, he rather hoped it would. And two years later during the mid-term elections, his love for Republicans was so obvious, that it was discussed with casual openness in Israel. Here, for example, is a typical report from the time.It s no secret that Netanyahu and his aides are praying for control of the U.S. Senate to fall to the Republicans, who already hold the majority of the House of Representatives. Based on recent U.S. polls, there s a fairly good chance those prayers will be answered. However, Netanyahu won t break open any champagne prematurely. He did that two years ago, before the presidential elections, only to see his favored candidate, Mitt Romney, lose to incumbent President Barack Obama.Unfortunately for the prime minister, he got his wish and still lost the battle. They really tried, but Republicans were unable to stop the Iranian nuclear agreement   even after skirting America s treason laws to try to elbow their way in.It seems apparent that the Israeli Prime Minister is still livid over the fact that Obama went ahead with the Iranian nuclear disarmament instead of listening to his calls for war. The two world leaders have never exactly seen eye-to-eye on the issue of Iran or anything else. Netanyahu, a right-wing hardliner, has resented Obama s calls for peace, including chastising Israel for its policies towards Palestinians. The fact that the United States still provides financial and military support to Israel to the tune of billions of dollars a year doesn t seem to calm him down, either.So rather than swallow his pride, Netanyahu has resorted to shameful displays of pettiness. What that means for the future of U.S.-Israel relations will be better known after the election.Featured image via Flickr ",News,"March 8, 2016"

20037,HOW CAN THIS HAPPEN IN AMERICA? Atheist Mayor Suspends And Jails LA Fireman For Praying At Scene Of Fire," Communism begins where atheism begins. -Karl MarxEarly this morning, a small town in Louisiana suspended one of its firefighters, 39-year-old Ronnie Edwards, without pay for praying at the scene of an uncontained fire. Edwards, who has been with the DeQuincy Fire Department since he was 21, was also arrested and sentenced to 30 days in jail. I just do what our Lord & Savior, Jesus Christ, would do,  Edwards told local DeQuincy news station DQLA6.  It s not about me, it s about spreading his message, you know? He works through me, I m just fortunate enough to be part of that. According to sources within the DeQuincy Fire Department, Edwards, known to locals as  The Praying Fireman , has been praying at the scene of fires since he joined the department in 1998, and it is only recently that the ritual has become an issue. Ronnie [Edwards] would always pray after we put out a fire, most of the time in the front yard or something,  fellow firefighter Eugene Ketchum said.  It never really bothered anyone, it was just something he did. We put our lives on the line whenever we respond to a fire. I figure if praying helps him out then why not let the guy pray? Ketchum said that things changed in 2014 when DeQuincy elected the first democratic mayor in its history, an African American atheist named Lawana Jones. He said that when Jones heard that Edwards made a habit of praying at fires she sent a memo to all city employees advising them that any expression of personal religious belief while on duty was a violation of their contract with the city.According to DeQuincy city attorney Paul Horner, Jones made four previous attempts to address the issue personally with Edwards, but Edwards became more defiant with each meeting. Refusal to obey an official city order is a misdemeanor and we must take action to address the crime,  Horner told reporters.  We didn t want to suspend the man and have him arrested but we were out of options. Mayor Jones, spoke with ABC News, about her decision to suspend and imprison Edwards for praying while at work. I m not anti-religious,  said Mayor Jones in a written statement,  But there is an appropriate time and place for everything. When he prays while on duty, he gives the impression that the City of DeQuincy is endorsing one particular religion over another. That is not the message that my office wants to send; it s not what the people of DeQuincy elected me to do.  Jones continued,  If you live in a county where democracy is established, you should be aware that the idea of the separation of church and state is the only way to prevent the government from forcing religion on you and directing your religion and its doctrines. Religion is one of the most important factors in most people s lives and it should be treated with reverence. In order to keep the government from directing religion and making it change how you are allowed to believe, church and state need to be separate. This allows for more openness when it comes to the decisions of the country. And in a world where everyone has different beliefs and different religions, a forced religion can cause an uprising and the dissolvent of a nation. You re supposed to do your job, not involve politics and religion into it. Republican Presidential Nominee, Donald Trump, caught wind of Edward s misfortune and while speaking to Fox News offered some harsh words for Mayor Jones. I can tell you; when I win the White House, there s gonna be some changes in DeQuincy. They re gonna reinstate Ronnie Edwards; they re gonna give him his back pay; they re give him restitution for the time he spent in jail; and Lawana Jones is going to pay for it. And if Mayor Jones doesn t want to do that, I ll have her thrown in jail so fast her head will spin. In spite of all that has happened, Edwards says that he is not bitter. The Bible says that there will be sacrifices when you choose to follow the path of righteousness; it says that you will be reviled by the wicked. I will continue to pray that Mayor Jones comes to accept Jesus Christ, and will keep praying that God sees fit to put Donald Trump in the White House, but whether or not any of that happens, I still trust God and know that everything is happening according to his divine plan. Edwards is scheduled for release from the DeQuincy City Jail on September 29th.  ABC",left-news,"Sep 2, 2016"
2471, Snowflake Trump Kicks Off Campaign Rally By Attacking The ‘Fake News’ Media,"America s so-called president held a rally in Melbourne, Florida, after just a few weeks into the job. Donald Trump spoke of the mess he has inherited (LOL) and of course, he lashed out at the media. This was Donald s campaign rally for 2020 and he s already been on vacation three times since taking the oath of office. His guest speakers were laughable, with one saying he s kept all of his campaign promises, including  draining the swamp. Trump promised to achieve his agenda despite the  lies, misrepresentations and false stories  thrown at him by the media. He said that without offering proof and the crowd ate it up. I want to speak to you without the filter of the fake news,  Trump said. The crowd, of course, erupted in cheers. The dishonest media, which has published one false story after another with no sources, even though they pretend they have them they make them up in many cases,  the scandal-plagued amateur president said.  They just don t want to report the truth. Many of our greatest presidents fought with the media and called them out,  Trump said while mentioning Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson and Abraham Lincoln, according to The Hill. When the media lies to people, I will never, ever, let them get away with it. I will do whatever I can that they don t get away with it,  Trump said.  They have their own agenda and their agenda is not your agenda. But despite all their lies, misrepresentations and false stories they could not defeat us in the primaries or general election and we ll continue to expose them as what they are and most importantly we ll continue to win, win, win,  Trump continued. Do you think that one media group back there, that one network, will show this crowd? Not one, not one,  Trump declared. Meanwhile, at that very moment, CNN was panning the crowd. I ve ordered the construction of a Great Border Wall that will start very shortly,  Trump said at the adulation rally. The problem is, though, that Trump did not tell his supporters that we, the taxpayers, will be footing the bill, not Mexico. We are going to drain the swamp in Washington, DC,  he said. The crowd chanted  Drain the swamp, Drain the swamp!  Trump s gullible supporters did this after he already filled the swamp up with terrifying creatures.On Air Force One, Trump told reporters,  Life is a campaign. Making our country great again is a campaign. For me, it s a campaign. To make America great again is absolutely a campaign. It s not easy, especially when we re also fighting the press.

17156,SOCIAL SECURITY RELIES ON “SELF REPORTING” ON DISABILITY BENEFITS – THE DECADES AND DOLLARS OF WASTE IS SHOCKING!,"We know that SS disability is full of fraud in the first place so why the heck does the SSA rely on people to  self report  overpayments? Just another BIG government idiotic program wasting our tax dollars unreal!We just reported on the cut in Social Security payments to 77% and it s no wonder the way they handle our money.The Social Security Administration (SSA) overpaid individuals a total of $371.5 million in disability benefits from fiscal year 2009 through fiscal 2013, according to a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report.These overpayments are cause for concern, as the Social Security s Disability Insurance Trust Fund is expected to go broke by 2016, according to SSA s 2015 annual report. During a time of growing concern about the solvency of the DI trust fund, it is important for SSA to take every opportunity to help improve the financial status of the program,  the GAO said. The report examined how these concurrent Federal Employees  Compensation Act (FECA) payments affect Disability Insurance (DI) overpayments.The GAO found that SSA did not detect concurrent FECA payments for about 1,040 individuals during at least one month from July 1, 2011, through June 30, 2014.To test SSA s internal controls, GAO randomly selected 20 beneficiaries for review. In all 20 cases, SSA s controls failed to detect and prevent overpayments. In seven of the cases, SSA did not detect overpayments for more than a decade, and each of these individuals received $100,000 in overpaid benefits.One of these seven individuals received FECA benefits in the 1980s and was approved for disability benefits 14 years later in 1994. The GAO found that this individual received $200,000 in overpayments for more than 20 years.The SSA s  internal controls  rely on beneficiaries to self-report overpayments.Read more: WFB",Government News,"Aug 4, 2015"
11152,OUCH! NEW BOOK Takes Readers Inside Hillary’s Nasty Campaign: Self-Righteous Hillary Was ‘so mad she couldn’t think straight’…Attacked Her Aides…Focused Too Much On Black Voters…Bill Gave Aides An “Ass-Chewing”,"The failed Presidential candidate attacked her aides with a  potent mix of exhaustion and exasperation  after the embarrassing loss to her rival Bernie Sanders in March last year.Clinton s top staff said she was  visibly, unflinchingly p***ed off at us  and blamed them for making her look  vulnerable .During another tirade Bill Clinton took over and gave aides an  a** chewing  on the phone and told them to  do their d**n jobs .The details of the rows show the tensions at the top of Clinton s presidential campaign, tensions that she did her best to keep quiet during the election.They are revealed in  Shattered: Inside Hillary Clinton s Doomed Campaign , which is out next week and delivers the scathing verdict that her campaign was  living in denial .The book says that neither Clinton nor her husband  could accept the simple fact that Hillary had hamstrung her own campaign and dealt the most serious blow to her own presidential aspirations .  Daily MailAn extract of the book was published by The Hill which said it showed that Clinton s campaign was  plagued by bickering : We Got An Ass-Chewing Hillary was so mad she couldn t think straight. She was supposed to be focused on the prep session for that night s Univision debate in Miami, but a potent mix of exhaustion and exasperation bubbled up inside.She d been humiliated in the Michigan primary the night before, a loss that not only robbed her of a prime opportunity to put Bernie Sandersdown for good but also exposed several of her weaknesses. How could she have been left so vulnerable? She knew   or at least she thought she did. The blame belonged to her campaign team, she believed, for failing to hone her message, energize important constituencies and take care of business in getting voters to the polls. And now, Jake Sullivan, her de facto chief strategist, was giving her lip about the last answer she d delivered in the prep session. That s not very good,  Sullivan corrected. Really?  Hillary snapped back.The room fell silent. Why don t you do it? The comment was pointed and sarcastic, but she meant it. So for the next 30 minutes, there he was, pretending to be Hillary while she critiqued his performance.Every time the Yale lawyer and former high school debate champ opened his mouth, Hillary cut him off.  That isn t very good,  she d say.  You can do better.  Then she d hammer him with a Bernie line.It wasn t just Sullivan in her crosshairs. She let everyone on her team have it that day.  We haven t made our case,  she fumed.  We haven t framed the choice. We haven t done the politics. She was visibly, unflinchingly pissed off at us as a group,  said one aide who was in the room for the humiliating scene.  And she let us know she felt that way. Hillary had been up into the wee hours the night before, agitating over her loss. This is because we made poor choices about where we traveled, she thought. She emailed Robby Mook to tell him she believed she d spent too much time in the cities of Detroit and Flint and not enough in the working-class white suburbs around them. Sensing just how angry she was, Mook responded by putting together a morning conference call so that Hillary could vent. But that didn t settle her; if anything, it left her more perplexed and angry, as her debate-prep team witnessed firsthand.Her aides took the browbeating   one of several she delivered in person and on the phone that day   in silence. They had a lot of their own thoughts on what went wrong, some of which echoed Hillary s assessment: her message was off for Michigan, and she had refused to go hard against trade; Mook had pinched pennies and failed to put organizers on the ground; the polling and analytics were a touch too rosy, meaning the campaign didn t know Bernie was ahead; she had set up an ambiguous decisionmaking structure on the campaign; and she d focused too heavily on black and brown voters at the expense of competing for the whites who had formed her base in 2008. The list went on and on.The underlying truth   the one that many didn t want to admit to themselves   was the person ultimately responsible for these decisions, the one whose name was on the ticket, hadn t corrected these problems, all of which had been brought to her attention before primary day. She d stuck with the plan, and it had cost her.Months earlier, Hillary Clinton turned her fury on her consultants and campaign aides, blaming them for a failure to focus the media on her platform.In her ear the whole time, spurring her on to cast blame on others and never admit to anything, was her husband. Neither Clinton could accept the simple fact that Hillary had hamstrung her own campaign and dealt the most serious blow to her own presidential aspirations.That state of denial would become more obvious than ever to her top aides and consultants during one conference call in the thick of the public discussion of her server. Joel Benenson, Mandy Grunwald, Jim Margolis, John Anzalone, John Podesta, Mook, Huma Abedin and Dan Schwerin were among the small coterie who huddled in Abedin s mostly bare corner office overlooking the East River at the campaign s Brooklyn headquarters. Hillary and Bill, who rarely visited, joined them by phone.Hillary s severe, controlled voice crackled through the line first. It carried the sound of a disappointed teacher or mother delivering a lecture before a whipping. That back end was left to Bill, who lashed out with abandon. Eyes cast downward, stomachs turning   both from the scare tactics and from their own revulsion at being chastised for Hillary s failures   Hillary s talented and accomplished team of professionals and loyalists simply took it. There was no arguing with Bill Clinton.You haven t buried this thing, the ruddy-cheeked former president rasped. You haven t figured out how to get Hillary s core message to the voters. This has been dragging on for months, he thundered, and nothing you ve done has made a damn bit of difference. Voters want to hear about Hillary s plans for the economy, and you re not making that happen. Now, do your damn jobs. We got an ass-chewing,  one of the participants recalled months later.Hillary came back on the line to close the lecture. It was hard to tell what was worse   getting hollered at by Bill or getting scolded by the stern and self-righteous Hillary. Neither was pleasant. You heard him, she admonished.  Get it straight.

Sunday September 20th is the Minnesota Vikings  home opener, big money day, so what better day to shut the light rail down and disrupt business as usual,  they said in a press release.  Enough is enough of business as usual! We must bring an end to white supremacy and the status quo. Black Lives Matter Saint Paul refers to an incident on Aug. 31 when Marcus Abrams, 17,  was beaten into multiple seizures by a group of Metro Transit police officers.  On Sunday, the group will be joined by Abrams, his mother,  and many others to talk about Autism, police brutality, and bringing an end to white supremacy. The demonstration is set to occur around 9:30 a.m. in St. Paul, starting just south of University Ave. on Lexington across from Dairy Queen. The light rail Green Line runs along University Avenue and includes stops on the University of Minnesota campus, where the Vikings are playing at noon at TCF Bank Stadium.Organizers are using the hashtag #BlackRail for Sunday s protest.Via: Progressives Today",politics,"Sep 19, 2015"
7385, WATCH: President Obama Just Landed In Cuba And The GOP Is Going Crazy,"President Obama, accompanied by First Lady Michelle along with his two daughters, just landed in Cuba and he is looking to thaw political differences between the two countries that has spanned decades. Obama, who has made reaching out to Cuba one of the main objectives of his presidency, earned the ire of the Republican party which has preferred divisive politics rather than open dialogue and understanding between the two countries. Florida senator and former presidential candidate Marco Rubio was upset after Obama had announced the visit. He said: Rather than achieving several long-standing U.S. goals and national security interests, you have methodically squandered this opportunity, legitimizing the Castro regime and enriching it in the process. A presidential visit to Cuba absent of any concessions from its government is a dangerous idea, and I urge you to reconsider. With that lack of innovative thinking, one can see why Rubio was trounced in his home state of Florida by Donald Trump. Then there s Ted Cruz, whose father is a Cuban American. The creepy Cruz also disagreed to the visit. He said: He has alienated and abandoned our friends and allies. You know, one of the first things he did when he became president was send the bust of Winston Churchill back to the United Kingdom. That was shameful. Despite Republican resistance, the president and dozens of U.S. lawmakers and business leaders joined him in Cuba for the visit. Air Force One touched down at Havana s airport on Sunday after a three-hour flight from Washington. While deep differences persist, Obama s approach in thinking outside of the box on Cuba will bring fruitful economic and political ties for both countries in the future.Instead of embracing the president s ingenuity, the Republicans will always be Republicans.Here s the video:",News,"March 20, 2016"

The Obama administration will agree to let Iran bypass questions about its past nuclear military work under any final deal signed in the coming weeks, according to reports.Western officials were quoted as telling the Associated Press on Friday that the United States has given up a major concession to Iran on the military front.While senior U.S. officials, including Secretary of State John Kerry, have long insisted that Iran will immediately have to submit to wide-ranging inspections and disclosures regarding its past nuclear work, the new reports indicate that this demand has been cast aside as world powers work to strike a final deal with the Islamic Republic by the end of June.According to the AP report:After a November 2013 interim accord, the Obama administration said a comprehensive solution  would include resolution of questions concerning the possible military dimension of Iran s nuclear program.  But those questions won t be answered by the June 30 deadline for a final deal, officials said, echoing an assessment by the U.N. nuclear agency s top official earlier this week.

22956,BIGGER THAN SNOWDEN: Wikileaks ‘Vault 7’ Classified CIA leak  – What Does It Mean?," He who controls the spice controls the universe.    Frank Herbert,  from the Dune seriesShawn Helton   21st Century WireOver the past week, much of the CIA s cyber hacking capabilities were allegedly laid bare by the Wikileaks  Vault 7  publication. According to the transparency seeking website, they ve published less than 1% of the intelligence regarding their Vault 7 series under the moniker Year Zero. All in all, the Wikileaks Vault 7 release is said to be the largest publication of classified intelligence in history. While there are still many unknowns associated with this latest CIA centered leak, there are a quite a few things to consider.Let s explore some of what we know to date and how it relates to other suspicious tech related stories over the past few years   YEAR ZERO   ZERO DAYS     Wikileaks discloses the CIA s cyber hacking capabilities   still no official comment from the intelligence agency. (Photo Illustration 21WIRE s Shawn Helton)Wikileaks  Vault 7 In 21WIRE s first report regarding the new revelations concerning Wikileaks Vault 7, we discussed how some of the content exposed in part one of Year Zero revealed what many in new media and other investigative fields have thought technologically possible for years.Here s a portion from the 21WIRE news alert mentioned above that describes the latest controversial publication by Wikileaks: WikiLeaks has released its largest ever publication of confidential documents on the Central Intelligence Agency. Entitled  Vault 7  and containing a password that echoed the alleged JFK quote  splinter the CIA into a thousand pieces and scatter it into the winds,  this leak comprises 8,761 documents and files from an isolated, high-security network situated inside the CIA s Center for Cyber Intelligence in Langley, Virginia. Year Zero , which is part one of the leak and conveniently named after a  zero day  exploit used by intelligence agencies, was gathered throughout 2016 and is said to be the  largest intelligence publication in history .Whilst a lot of the information and methodology outlined in  Year Zero  is of no surprise to security analysts and researchers since the Edward Snowden (image, left) revelations, once again the public has explicit confirmation of how one of the most powerful intelligence agencies in the world, aided by their international counterparts like GCHQ, have been infiltrating and scooping vast quantities of private information from Apple and Android devices right up to Samsung  Smart TV  technology where false  stand-by  modes and live microphones can be executed to record information and send it back to the appropriate servers. The  Year Zero  leaks a simple but cleaver play on the term zero day   something which is defined on Wikipedia as an undisclosed computer-software vulnerability that hackers can exploit to adversely affect computer programs, data, additional computers or a network. A zero day, zero hour exploit is said to leave a software author without the necessary time to correct coding or  workaround  actions of a particular hack or intrusive malware damage. (Image Source: daily express)According to Wikileaks and its editor-in-chief  Julian Assange, their most recent  treasure trove  of confidential files were obtained by a current or former CIA contractor, a story similar in scope and impact to the collection of documents dropped by former CIA/NSA contractor Edward Snowden but are said to be much larger.This time, the public has been given a glance inside the prism of the CIA s cyber hacking potential and data mining efforts similar to the NSA.In May of 2013, Snowden revealed information displaying that American citizens as well as other foreign nations throughout the world were subject to unprecedented levels of spying at the behest of the NSA. Massive data mining via XKeyScore and other similar applications proved to be very controversial particularly in America   as it seemed to be in direct contradiction to the US Constitution s 4th Amendment.Over the past decade other aspects of NSA spying activities were revealed under the George W Bush administration in 2005 and further brought to light by Mark Klein, a former AT&T technician who exposed how the multinational telecommunications company was working with the intelligence community to collect the public s data.In 2011, Gadgets and Gizmos reported the following: The recent Web 2.0 2011 conference in San Francisco saw the issue made public and now the worry is that private information could be obtained by third parties using this secretly stored data.Once the data is accessed it can even be downloaded onto an interactive map which shows where the owner of the device has been lately. So far the best way to avoid this causing a problem is to go into the settings menu and turn of the location services all together. The newly leaked Vault 7 documents identify specific cyber weapons, hacking systems, viruses and malware created by the CIA that can be used on just about anyone or any entity. This most assuredly will cause other countries to become more critical of the agency s cyber capabilities. By the looks of it, this is something that appears to be happening in Germany, as the Wikileaks docu-dump exposed an apparent CIA spy-hub in Frankfurt.Zero Hedge reports: The consulate was the focus of a German investigation into US intelligence capabilities following the 2013 revelation that NSA agents had tapped Chancellor Angela Merkel s phone.German daily  S ddeutsche Zeitung  reported the building was known to be home to a vast network of intelligence personnel including CIA agents, NSA spies, military secret service personnel, Department of Homeland Security employees and Secret Service employees. It reported the Americans had also established a dense network of outposts and shell companies in Frankfurt. Germany s reaction could prove to be more theatrical than that of true concern   only time will tell.If Vault 7 is to be accepted wholesale, it also reveals that since the 9/11 attacks the CIA has gained political and budgetary preeminence over the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA). The CIA found itself building not just its now infamous drone fleet, but a very different type of covert, globe-spanning force   its own substantial fleet of hackers.  Part and parcel to this, Wikileaks contends that CIA hackers have developed cyber weaponry to spy on people through cell phones, computers and smart TVs.According to  Year Zero  part one of the Wikileaks Vault 7 release: The increasing sophistication of surveillance techniques has drawn comparisons with George Orwell s 1984, but  Weeping Angel , developed by the CIA s Embedded Devices Branch (EDB), which infests smart TVs, transforming them into covert microphones, is surely its most emblematic realization.The attack against Samsung smart TVs was developed in cooperation with the United Kingdom s MI5/BTSS. After infestation, Weeping Angel places the target TV in a  Fake-Off  mode, so that the owner falsely believes the TV is off when it is on. In  Fake-Off  mode the TV operates as a bug, recording conversations in the room and sending them over the Internet to a covert CIA server. Interestingly, Wikileaks published a batch of classified CIA spy/hacking documents that not only include the privacy invading  Weeping Angel  developed by the clandestine agency to listen on microphones covertly but also ways the CIA has sought to remotely infect and control Microsoft Windows,  with viruses like  Hammer Drill  as well as automated infestation and control of CIA malware, such as  Assassin  and  Medusa. According to security analysts, the CIA has designed the covert methods listed above for hostile foreign actors. However, since the intelligence service has had a propensity of going rogue, these technological leaps made by the secretive agency should be a major concern to the general public.Over the past few decades there have been other spoken critics of intelligence services such as well-known journalist James Bamford and former high-ranking NSA official William Binney, both who have come forward to share the inner workings of the security world. The screenshot above from Wikileaks Vault 7 discusses CIA s techniques that can be used to frame other entities for a malware attack.Framing the Big Bear?One of the more curious details contained in Vault 7 were the revelations concerning the CIA s ability to mask any hacking  fingerprints that could potentially implicate the agency. Additionally, the secretive agency could also leave behind potential evidence that a cyber attack was carried out by a foreign body or nation. Here s another passage from the Wikileaks publication on the matter: Tradecraft DO s and DON Ts  contains CIA rules on how its malware should be written to avoid fingerprints implicating the  CIA, US government, or its witting partner companies  in  forensic review . QUESTION: Is it possible that the CIA could use its highly specialized malware to frame a foreign country for violating US national security?Zero Hedge reported the following Wikileaks information concerning the CIA s ability to bypass device encryption before it can be applied as well as mask itself from forensic review via its own entity, the Center For Cyber Inteliigence (CCI):Among the more notable disclosures which, if confirmed,  would rock the technology world , the CIA had managed to bypass encryption on popular phone and messaging services such as Signal, WhatsApp and Telegram. According to the statement from WikiLeaks, government hackers can penetrate Android phones and collect  audio and message traffic before encryption is applied. Another profound revelation is that the CIA can engage in  false flag  cyberattacks which portray Russia as the assailant. Discussing the CIA s Remote Devices Branch s UMBRAGE group, Wikileaks  source notes that it  collects and maintains a substantial library of attack techniques  stolen  from malware produced in other states including the Russian Federation. Here s an image originally published by Wikileaks Vault 7 that displays the CIA s Center For Cyber Intelligence apparatus With claims of alleged Russian hacking at the forefront of Western intelligence, let s take another look at how that meme started Prior to the 2016 US presidential race taking place the mainstream media along with the White House, set the stage for a massive PR push implicating Russia as a disrupting force for democracy   allegedly through Kremlin-sponsored hacking of US democratic institutions and through  sophisticated Russian propaganda. In August, the western media s claims against Russia began to hit overdrive, when the  New York Times s Moscow bureau was the target of an attempted cyber attack this month. But so far, there is no evidence that the hackers, believed to be Russian, were successful. Flash forward to September here and here, as well as early October in the lead up to President Obama s Russian Hack decree, the Clinton-friendly outlet, the NY Times, had all but solidified the Russian cyber-hack claims   but once again, without any definitive evidence or proof.Throw in another American  October surprise  in the form distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, renewed calls for the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) internet, led to so-called cyber experts blaming the largest  hack on America  because of the inability to pass SOPA   in effect, reigniting the previously stalled SOPA in Washington DC, along with all of its draconian copyright law positions   all perfectly timed as mainstream reports regarding  fake news suddenly became all the rage across all forms of media.Will Vault 7 prove to shed light on other CIA related activities?The screenshot above from Wikileaks Vault 7 discusses the CIA S HIVE multi-platform software control system.DDoS AttacksIn October of 2016, I noted some of the suspicious activity surrounding America s biggest distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack that was said to be caused by the malware Mirai. Given that there was a  hardcoded blacklist  of certain government entities and major multinational companies/defense contractors from being attacked   its seems more likely that the attack was US government created: Interestingly, according to Bradley Barth, a senior reporter for the IT security online magazine SC, the Mirai (supposedly leaked on September 30th) contains a very unique subset of characteristics that will not attack certain IP addresses such as the Department of Defense (DoD), the US Postal Service and consumer giant General Electric (GE) due to its coding: An Imperva analysis of the source code revealed several unique traits, including a hardcoded blacklist of IPs that the adversary did not want to attack, perhaps in order to keep a low profile. Some of these IPs belonged to the Department of Defense, the U.S. Postal Service and General Electric (GE). Though SC claims that the makers of Mirai may have been trying to keep a low profile, the recent DDoS attack attributed to the malware was as high-profile as you can get   so this begs the question, what was the real reason the malware creators put an IP blockade on the DoD, the Postal Service and GE? Is it possible that the DDoS attack originated from whitehat hackers associated with the US government, a major US defense contractor like GE or some other intelligence service, possibly the CIA?  HACKED?    Michael Hastings death sparked a wave of controversial theories. (Image source: pinterest)CIA Hacking Tools Upon closer inspection of the Wikileaks Vault 7 release, we see that in addition to the public s privacy apparently being invaded through the CIA s ability to bypass encryption on Android and iOS phones, computers and smart TVs   there was also the Wikileaks revelations exposing the agency s development of vehicular control.Wikileaks Vault 7 stated the following stunning revelation: As of October 2014 the CIA was also looking at infecting the vehicle control systems used by modern cars and trucks. The purpose of such control is not specified, but it would permit the CIA to engage in nearly undetectable assassinations. It is this part of Year Zero that has revived the conspiracy surrounding the death of investigative reporter and war veteran Michael Hastings, who died after his Mercedes C250 coupe supposedly burst into a giant fireball in the early hours of June 18 2013. According to eyewitness accounts, Hastings was going at a high rate of speed as  sparks and flames  were seen before his fiery automobile crashed.The UK s Sun recently revisited the Hastings tragedy. Here s a passage of that report: Hastings   a vocal critic of government mass surveillance   had sent an email to colleagues and friends just 12 hours earlier, telling them he was onto a  big story  and was under investigation.The Buzzfeed and Rolling Stone contributor, 33, wrote: The Feds are interviewing my  close friends and associates . May be wise to immediately request legal counsel before any conversations or interviews about our news-gathering practices. I m onto a big story and need to go off the radar for a bit. WikiLeaks also tweeted after the crash to say Hastings had contacted its lawyer Jennifer Robinson just before his death, claiming the FBI was investigating him.The FBI took a  departure from normal policy  to deny that Hastings had ever been under investigation after receiving a barrage of calls about his death. The CIA has failed to confirm or deny the authenticity of the Vault 7 release, only deepening the mystery surrounding the death of Hastings.The question of CIA control over cars and trucks naturally leads us to what was revealed regarding high-tech avionics in recent years  (Photo Illustration 21WIRE s Shawn Helton)Uninterruptible Flight ControlIn my article entitled  FLIGHT CONTROL: Boeing s  Uninterruptible Autopilot System , Drones & Remote Hijacking, I noted the CIA s involvement in certain advancements in flight technology. Lets revisit a portion of that article describing the agency s involvement: On December 4th of 2006, it was announced that Boeing had won a patent on an uninterruptible autopilot system for use in commercial aircraft. This was the first public acknowledgment by Boeing about the existence of such an autopilot system.The new autopilot patent was reported by John Croft for Flight Global, with the news piece subsequently linked by a Homeland Security News Wire and other British publications around the same time. According to the DHS release, it was disclosed that  dedicated electrical circuits  within an onboard flight system could control a plane without the need of pilots, stating that the advanced avionics would fly the aircraft remotely, independently of those operating the plane: The  uninterruptible  autopilot would be activated   either by pilots, by onboard sensors, or even remotely via radio or satellite links by government agencies like the Central Intelligence Agency, if terrorists attempt to gain control of a flight deck. Continuing, I outlined the suspicious nature of both the MH370 disaster and that of MH17. Since then there have been a number of strange airline catastrophes including Germanwings 9525 and EygptAir MS804. Following the apparent  vanishing act  of Malaysian Airlines flight MH370, many investigators and researchers began to question the likelihood of such an event happening in today s high-tech world.At 21WIRE, we ve also looked into the unprecedented disappearance of MH370 and the subsequent downing of MH17, as certain details came to light regarding the history of the remote autopilot function installed within Boeing commercial airliners (a subject which also opens the door to the events of 9/11).The Boeing 777 along with other Boeing models, can in fact be flown remotely through the use of independent embedded software and satellite communication. Once this advanced system is engaged, it can disallow any pilot or potential hijacker from controlling a plane, as the rooted setup uses digital signals that communicate with air traffic control, satellite links, as well as other government entities for the remainder of a flight s journey.This technology is known as the Boeing Honeywell  Uninterruptible  Autopilot System. Has the CIA had the ability to remotely hack vehicles for much longer than we think?The Wikileaks release once again opens questions about 9/11, the deep state and what intelligence agencies have control over in the War on Terror era.  CLOAKED    What other blueprints will Wikileaks provide regarding the CIA s capabilities? (Image Source: offgraun)Public Privacy Vs. the  Deep State In an article detailing the encryption saga between Apple and the FBI, we stated that there are no guarantees in the security world, especially if a digital master-key were to be created, as this would potentially make it easier for invaders (either the government, or various hackers) mining for data moving forward into the future.If the CIA has been secretly data mining just like the NSA, they have unquestionably violated the public s constitutional rights and trust.Is this really what the CIA has been up too?In a 2016 the Guardian interviewed some of those involved in the technology and security sector. These individuals offered their thoughts regarding the government s continued encroachment on individual privacy. here s another look at that passage:Dan Kaminsky, the security expert who made his name with the discovery that one of the most basic parts of the internet, the domain name system, was vulnerable to fraud   disagrees:  Feds want final authority on engineering decisions, and their interests don t even align with fighting the vast bulk of real-world crime. Continuing, The Guardian interviewed former FBI agent Michael German, currently the Brennan Center, a judicial think-tank. The following is a part of that interview: After 9/11, you had this concept of total information awareness. The intelligence community was very enamoured of the idea that all information was available. Much like the NSA, they wanted to see it all, collect it all, and analyse it all. Western political leaders and their media arms often discuss the dangers of so-called terror sleeper cells residing in a nation near you, but none of them acknowledge or attempt to explain the historical fact that for decades, they themselves have helped to harbor, grow, foment and radicalize individuals through their own clandestine  counter-terrorism  operations.Many of these operations have directly implicated security agencies (and military alliances) such as the FBI, CIA, MI5, MI6 and NATO   in the production of real terror.While most of these counter intelligence operations have fallen under the umbrella of the so-called War On Terror era, they have also largely served to obfuscate the nature of various government programs that some critics suggest is the work of a  deep state  apparatus.QUESTION: Will there be a large public outcry regarding the lack of oversight over the CIA s spying and hacking capabilities?Watch below as 21WIRE s Patrick Henningsen discusses the  NSA-like body  of the CIA on Peter Lavelle s Cross Talk show on RT In Summary The timely release of Vault 7 comes amid a flurry of wiretapping claims from President Donald Trump, while a review of US cyber capabilities and vulnerabilities is currently underway.Additionally, the Wikileaks Vault 7 publication revealed the following stunning information concerning the scope of the CIA s cyber capabilities previously unknown to the public: By the end of 2016, the CIA s hacking division, which formally falls under the agency s Center for Cyber Intelligence (CCI), had over 5000 registered users and had produced more than a thousand hacking systems, trojans, viruses, and other  weaponized  malware. Such is the scale of the CIA s undertaking that by 2016, its hackers had utilized more code than that used to run Facebook. The CIA had created, in effect, its  own NSA  with even less accountability and without publicly answering the question as to whether such a massive budgetary spend on duplicating the capacities of a rival agency could be justified. In 2012, then CIA Director David Petraeus, mused about the emergence of an  Internet of Things    that is, wired devices   at a summit for In-Q-Tel, the CIA s venture capital firm. The Wired magazine article continued, disclosing that the future of spying hinged on smart devices and a smart home: All those new online devices are a treasure trove of data if you re a  person of interest  to the spy community. Once upon a time, spies had to place a bug in your chandelier to hear your conversation. With the rise of the  smart home,  you d be sending tagged, geolocated data that a spy agency can intercept in real time when you use the lighting app on your phone to adjust your living room s ambiance. The public has long been prepped for the surreal level of surveillance we are only just beginning to understand, whether through books, film or tech magazines or by the government itself   the warning signs of lost privacy and protection have been hidden in plain sight for decades.Even still, Wikileaks Vault 7 shocks the avid researcher, writer and pundit as it gives further insight into the CIA s multi-pronged ability to distort the perception of the public, while vacuuming up all kinds of data.*** Author Shawn Helton is Associate Editor of 21st Century Wire, as well as an independent media forensic analyst specializing in criminal investigations and media coverage from war theaters.

He is (quite understandably) angry by Trump Jr. s misappropriation of his image to promote a xenophobic, racist and anti-refugee policy: This was not done with my permission, I don t support his politics and I would never take his money to use it.In 1974, when I was six-years old, I was a refugee from the Turkish occupation of Cyprus so I would never approve the use of this image against refugees. Oops. That s only a minor faux pas   oh wait. It s a major embarrassment to use an image that originates with a refugee to speak out against refugees.Kittos took the picture six years ago in his studio while he was experimenting with a specific type of flash. He s not on Twitter, but friends familiar with his work let him know of this unauthorized and offensive use of one of his photos, which does appear on Flickr.Just what is up with this campaign acting like copyright only applies to other people?We digress. Anyway.Kittos  photo was never intended for political use and he certainly would never release it or sell it for such usage. Trump Jr. and others, like the disgraceful former Congresscritter Joe Walsh, don t seem to care, though, as long as they can make their point that refugees are dangerous.Wrigley, the makers of Skittles candy, also upbraided Trump Jr. for his baloney: Skittles are candy. Refugees are people.We don t feel it is an appropriate analogy. We will respectfully refrain from further commentary as anything we say could be misinterpreted as marketing. For his part, Kittos isn t sure if he s going to pursue legal action. However, he did say: I would like the Trump campaign to delete the image, but they are probably not interested in what I have to say.I was thinking about getting lawyers involved but I don t know if I have the patience.This isn t about the money for me. They could have just bought a cheap image from a micro stock library. This is pure greed from them. I don t think they care about my feelings. They should not be stealing an image full stop. And they definitely need to learn how to source copyrighted work if they re the so-called  law and order campaign  that they claim to be. But that s beside the point. Kittos is, himself, a refugee. It s natural that he would feel especially upset by this use of his image. It also speaks to the insanely tone-deaf nature of the Trump campaign. They don t care about such trivia as long as their point is made.Featured image by John Sommers II/Getty Images",News,"September 20, 2016"
5044, Breitbart Fails HARD In Trying To Prove Polls Are Biased,"We have roughly 92 billion opinion polls going around regarding the presidential election, and right now, they all show Trump and Hillary either locked in a dead heat, or Hillary leading, across the nation and in key states. Of course, this means the polls are rigged, or at least biased, right? Right. So Breitbart, being of sound editorial judgment, commissioned Gravis to conduct their own poll. The results?Hillary leads Trump 42 percent to 37 percent.That s in a four-way race, not a two-way. The poll surveyed 2,832 people on August 9, and carries a 1.8 percent margin of error. So Hillary is outside of even that.Alex Marlow, editor-in-chief at Breitbart, has this to say about their poll: It s an open secret that polls are often manipulated and spun to create momentum for a particular candidate or issue. Breitbart News Network s first national poll marks the start of a major initiative to give our readers an accurate assessment on where the American people stand on the key topics and people of the day   without the mainstream media filter. It s pretty telling when the poll you conducted, with the intent of being as neutral as possible, brings back the same results as the polls you think are biased. This poll has Hillary leading Trump by five percent. In a four-way race, Reuters/Ipsos  most recent poll likewise has Hillary leading by five points, Economist/YouGov has her up by six points, and even Rasmussen Reports has her up by three points.But Trump s crowds are huge and Hillary s aren t, so of course the polls are screwy. Breitbart and Gravis are trying to put a positive spin on it, though, saying that the poll reveals areas where Trump can reach more voters. For some reason, Doug Kaplan, managing partner at Gravis, thinks things like 11 percent support for Trump from the black community presents a problem for Hillary. His rationale seems to be based only on the fact that Hillary has less support from the black community than Obama did in 2012.Hillary also won big when it came to the question,  Do you agree or disagree? Donald Trump/Hillary Clinton would fight for people like me.  Overall, only 39 percent feel that Hillary would fight for them, and Trump had 38 percent of that. However, when it came to Muslims, a stunning 84 percent said they think she ll fight for them.Obviously, Trump won t have that kind of support from the Muslim community. Not with his Islamophobic remarks toward them.Overall, Breitbart walked away from this with egg on their face, because they sought to prove one thing and failed miserably. In the end, all they showed is that either Gravis is biased, too, or that (gasp!) the polls are more accurate than the right would like to believe.Photo of Hillary by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images.

22616,(Don’t Hold The Press) Jeb Bush Endorses Ted Cruz For President,"21st Century Wire says OK. As political endorsements go, this one is about as sexy as a box of Wheaties.This exciting development comes just hours after Cruz was declared the winner in Utah s GOP primary contest.Now if it was Barbara giving the honors, then we might be intrigued  Of course, we should be so lucky   Huff PostFormer Florida Gov. Jeb Bush is endorsing Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) for president, Politico reported. Bush, who dropped out of the race last month, confirmed the endorsement on Wednesday in an email from the Cruz campaign. Ted is a consistent, principled conservative who has demonstrated the ability to appeal to voters and win primary contests, including yesterday s Utah caucus, Bush said on Facebook.The statement also went out in an email to supporters from the Cruz campaign, the New York Times said.

14054,NBA THREATENS NC…Let Men Share Bathrooms With Your Daughters Or We’ll Cancel All-Star Game,"So in other words, parents better allow men to use the same bathrooms and locker rooms as your little girls or the NBA is gathering up their balls and running away. Is the NBA still a professional sports organization, or have they morphed into a radical social change group? If the answer is the latter, you won t see me pay another dime to sit in the stands of another NBA game. I don t think I m alone in that thinking either. Putting social issues before the safety and well-being of women and children is misguided and dangerous. Click HERE to comment on NBA Commissioner Adam Silver s Facebook page. Commissioner Adam Silver believes the NBA has been  crystal clear  that the 2017 All-Star Game only stays in Charlotte if a North Carolina law goes.Political and business leaders he s spoken with in the state believe it will, so he s holding off for now on setting any deadlines for when the NBA might act.Silver said last week that the law that limits anti-discrimination protections for lesbian, gay and transgender people was  problematic  for the league, but he believed dialogue was more useful than ultimatums at this point, so has continued discussions with North Carolina officials. The sense was that if the NBA could give us some time, they in the community of North Carolina were optimistic they would see a change in the law. They weren t guaranteeing it and I think which was why my response was the event still is 10 months from now, we don t need to make a decision yet,  Silver said Thursday during a meeting of Associated Press Sports Editors. We ve been, I think, crystal clear that we believe a change in the law is necessary for us to play in the kind of environment that we think is appropriate for a celebratory NBA event, but that we did have some time and that if the view of the people who were allied with us in terms of a change, if their view, the people on the ground in North Carolina, was that the situation would best be served by us not setting a deadline, we would not set a deadline at this time. The North Carolina law directs transgender people to use public toilets corresponding to the sex listed on their birth certificate. The law also excludes LGBT people from state anti-discrimination protections, blocks local governments from expanding LGBT protections, and bars all types of workplace discrimination lawsuits from state courts.Several entertainment acts have already canceled plans for North Carolina but Silver said last week he didn t think a warning that the NBA could pull the All-Star weekend out would send the proper message, particularly because the league still has the Charlotte Hornets, owned by Michael Jordan, playing there. The Hornets host playoff games this weekend.All-Star weekend is scheduled for February. Silver said there is no urgency to make a decision because the league could very easily find out which arenas would take on the event if necessary.Via: AP News  ",politics,"Apr 23, 2016"
7726, Trump Releases His Health Care Plan – Here’s The One Thing You’ll Hate The Most (VIDEO),"For the longest time, Donald Trump has been advocating for the complete and utter repeal of Obamacare   yet through all his talking he hasn t released a plan of his own   that is until now. On Wednesday, The Donald laid out a seven-point plan, which is so lacking in detail and void of specifics that a high school student could fit the entire thing on one page, double spaced even.So   what s the first thing he wants to do? By getting rid of Obamacare altogether, as he says, Trump will allow insurers to discriminate once again against people with pre-existing conditions, giving insurers the option not to provide coverage as they see fit, along with all the other protections Obamacare provides. For a full list of those shelters, visit HERE. Trump has said in the past that he would replace the pre-existing condition rule with something else, something  much greater  but he must have forgotten about that promise because he didn t offer any alternatives, not in this one-page plan.While Obamacare may seem complicated to some, getting rid of common sense provisions like this should alarm every American. And, Trump isn t alone on this. Paul Ryan, the new Speaker of The House, was forced to admit that popular rules like this (even among Republican voters) would end up going away along with Obamacare.So   that s number one   gut anything and everything, even if it makes sense   just because it s something Obama came up with. Got it.What else is in there?Trump wants to allow insurers to compete across state lines. You might remember this if you watched the debate last week, where Rubio got the applause of the night for making fun of Trump about it. This was before Trump made his entire plan available, and the only thing he could think of was this aspect of it.  Get rid of the state lines,  you could hear him say, over and over.It s possible this is the only real part of Donald Trump s plan that he cares about. After all, this was the only part he could remember when called out on the debate stage in front of everyone.The other remaining 5 points of Trump s plan, are as follows:Healthcare reform is much more complicated than this, however. This seven-point plan doesn t tell us much. All it really says is what Republican voters want to hear.And   here s another doozy. He made a statement trying to link his strict immigration policies as being one factor in limiting the cost of health insurance for illegal immigrants, but what he really did was admit that illegal immigrants only cause a tiny fraction of the total cost of healthcare. Donald Trump says illegal immigrants cost the U.S. $11 billion annually, but total health care spending in the U.S is around $2.9 trillion. That s not even a drop in the bucket. This is just further proof, straight from the source, that illegals aren t driving up the cost of healthcare like Republicans claim.It s possible that the real reason Trump s plan is so short is because he s perfectly happy with insurance companies filling in the small details instead of the government. We ve already been there and done that. It didn t work for the majority of Americans before, and it won t now, either.Featured image via Facebook.",News,"March 3, 2016"
8457, Carson Campaign Demands Gay Soldiers Go Back In The Closet Lest They Get Too ‘Militant’ About It,"Ben Carson is having a really bad week. He s had a lot of bad weeks recently, but this one is particularly bad.The last Republican debate was considered Carson s do or die moment and he died  unambiguously  while we all watched. The once rising star of the 2016 election went out, not with a bang, but with a characteristic whisper. A soft, monotone word salad. His trademark. By the end of the night, Carson was misquoting the preamble to the Constitution and perhaps slowly realizing that this would be the last time many people would ever remember he ever had run for president at all.The very next day, while Carson slept off his post-relevancy hangover and waited to come in 6th in Iowa, his campaign chairman Robert Dees was talking to reporters. Normally this would be a good thing, but Dees happens to be a raging homophobe and the questions happened to be about gay soldiers.Speaking with radio host Alan Colmes, Dees was insistent that gay people cannot be allowed to be open about their sexual orientation or risk destroying the entire military. Well the ultimate test for military effectiveness is readiness, it s cohesion, and anything that detracts from that is important. Dr. Carson often says it s important for people to have rights in accordance with life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness in the U.S. Constitution, but no particular group ought to have extra rights. Why would the right to be yourself be considered an  extra  right? Dees explains: Where the extra rights come in is when the gays in the military become somewhat militaristic to the detriment of unit cohesion,  he said.Dees added that a question to be considered in determining policy toward gay people in the military was,  whether they, in the military, flaunt it and disrupt cohesion. Heaven forbid soldiers become too militaristic in the military. However, Dees was not talking about fighting. He was worried that gay people would use their secret weapon:  Flaunting  their gayness.What makes Dees  statements so cringeworthy is that he isn t just an idiot, he s an idiot who used to be a general in the military. As such, he might have bothered to read up on the military s own research into how gay people effect a unit s cohesion. All the way back in 2010, the Pentagon was telling the president and the nation that repealing  don t ask, don t tell  and letting gay people serve openly did nothing but bring the military in line with where the country already was. The general lesson we take from   transformational experiences in history is that in matters of personnel change within the military, predictions and surveys tend to overestimate negative consequences, and underestimate the U.S. military s ability to adapt and incorporate within it ranks the diversity that is reflective of American society at large,  the report concluded.Going further:This report confirms that  by every measure   from unit cohesion to recruitment and retention to family readiness   we can transition to a new policy in a responsible manner that ensures our military strength and national security,  Obama said in a written statement.Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and the Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen were also strongly in favor of dropping the ludicrous DADT policy. Since its dissolution, the military hasn t crumbled. Nobody is  flaunting  anything. The military continues to be one of the strongest and best trained fighting forces in the world.Dees is certainly living in a fantasy world, but it s hard to expect much who decided to ride Ben Carson s coat tails all the way to a massive loss in the very first primary and an inevitable campaign suspension. Carson s track record on talking about gay Americans isn t much better. During his brief moment in the national spotlight, he once floated the idea that prison rape turns people gay.Much of Carson s campaign has been predicated on the idea that he is above the fray. He s consistently pleaded with his fellow candidates and the nation more generally to stop the mudslinging. It s an admirable goal   which happens to be total malarkey. Carson has never had a problem with going after  liberals ,  gay people ,  Muslims , or any other group he feels doesn t align with his worldview. Gay people can t serve in the military. Muslims can t be president. Liberals can t well  do anything.In the end, the only group of people who seem safe in Carson s America are conservative Christians like himself.

7030, White Catholic Schoolkids Threaten To Lynch Black Classmate (VIDEO),"An as yet unconfirmed number of white students of a Catholic school in California have been suspended after sending a video to a black student threatening a lynching.The Modesto Bee reports:A racist death threat video posted on social media by a Central Catholic High junior has led to the suspension of students involved and a criminal investigation, but an African American community group is calling for calm while police do their work. People are asking me,  What can I do?,  but I want to find out what s been done, first. Let the natural process take its course,  said attorney Jacq Wilson, who is working with the family of the boy targeted in the video.Efforts to dismiss the incident as a high school prank fell on deaf ears in the community. As Wilson puts it: When has bullying ever been a joke? When has a death threat ever been a joke? Right now, with everything going on (nationally), what were they waiting for, for someone to die? The fact is that people are hurt. People are scared. It s a hate crime. It s possibly even a domestic act of terrorism. It s a criminal threat, It is also reassuring that Central Catholic High President Jim Pecchenino came out immediately with his own unambiguous statement on the matter. Students involved in that video have been suspended. They are not on our campus. We ll follow our process for discipline,  he said. The whole video is despicable, every part of it. The noose, the gun going off, it s just unconscionable to view. It s very unsettling. The students remain on suspension while the matter is investigated further, with a view to pressing chimerical charges against those responsible. Featured image via Screengrab",News,"April 8, 2016"

21178,EVERY U.S. CITIZEN TAKEN HOSTAGE IN IRAN To Be Awarded Millions…With A Catch…Iran’s Not Paying…YOU Are!,"Just another slap in the face to US citizens. Our government arranges massive payments to hostages taken by the terrorist nation of Iran, as they walk away unscathed .A fund of over $1 billion has been created for the U.S. embassy personnel taken hostage by Iran after the 1979 Islamic Revolution, but it is the U.S. taxpayer, not Iran, who will be paying for it.The new fund, known as the  United States Victims of State Sponsors of Terrorism Fund,  was an addition to the omnibus bill put forward by Congress and signed into law by President Barack Obama Dec. 28. As much as $4.4 million could go to each of the 52 Americans held by Iran, with another $600,000 going to each spouse and child of the victims. The provision authorizes $1.025 billion from the Department of the Treasury to be used to pay for the new fund. Additionally, the legislation includes a 25 percent cap on any attorney s fees, which could lead to as much as $250 million total going to lawyers of the various victims involved.The victims were taken hostage during Iran s Islamic Revolution led by former Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khomeini. Hundreds of student protesters stormed the U.S. embassy in Tehran taking 52 U.S. personnel hostage for 444 days. Several months after the takeover, former President Jimmy Carter authorized Operation Eagle Claw, a rescue attempt by U.S. special operations forces which would later fail. The hostages would eventually be released after a lengthy negotiation process the day of President Ronald Reagan s inauguration in January, 1981. Victims of the embassy attack have been seeking compensation for their captivity for some time, but have been prevented from taking legal action against Iran. The 1981 Algiers Accords, the agreement which secured the release of the hostages, had a provision barring the victims from suing the Iranian government.  Iran is not paying the money, but it s as close as you can get,  says Thomas Lankford, an attorney for one of the victims, speaking to The Washington Post. Lankford refers to a clause in the new law which mandates that any money collected from the BNP Paribas scandal will be used for the new fund and the various 9/11 victim funds. The U.S. levied a fine of $9 billion on the French bank in June 2014 for its evasion of sanctions against countries like Iran, Cuba and North Korea.The staggering amount of compensation being paid to the victims is remarkably higher than the $262,000 suggested by the George W. Bush administration in 2003.  Some may be surprised that a fiscally conservative Republican-controlled Congress would authorize payments of more than $250 million from the U.S. Treasury to private attorneys, even on behalf of victims of terrorism deserving compensation,  writes attorney John Bellinger in the Lawfare blog.

18510,HILARIOUS! TRUMP Reserves “Special Seats” For NYT’s Reporters At Press Conference After Publishing FAKE NEWS On Russian Probe,"Former FBI Director James Comey admitted to the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday that he asked a Columbia professor friend to leak a memo he kept regarding his conversation with President Trump to the press.The memo was leaked to one of the key players in the witch hunt for a Russian connection with President Trump Russia, the New York Times, the leftist media arm of the Democrat Party. The New York Times ran with the story that Trump was pushing Comey to drop the Flynn investigation.GP: Comey also told the Senate Intelligence Committee he knew The New York Times was publishing leaked reports that were not accurate. But James Comey said he would not tell the NY Times about their fraudulent report because that would not be right (?).Jame Comey s priorities are a bit confusing.Zero Hedge   For those of you who continue to consume anonymously-sourced news from the likes of CNN, NYT, WAPO, etc, as pure fact and a perfect substitute for actual, unbiased journalism, while blindly ignoring the overwhelming evidence which continues to suggest these outlets are simply pushing a sensationalized narrative aimed at bringing down an administration of which they disapprove, please consider Comey s testimony from earlier today in which he describes a February NY Times story, which alleged numerous contacts between Trump associates and Russia, as  almost entirely wrong Meanwhile, in earlier testimony with Senator Risch, Comey further explained why anonymously sourced stories can often be pure  nonsense. Comey:   In the main it was not true.  And, again, all of you know this, maybe the American people do not, the challenge, and I m not picking on reporters, about writing stories about classified information is, the people talking about it often don t really know what s going on and those of us who actually know what s going on are not talking about it.And we don t call the press to say  hey, you got that thing wrong about his sensitive topic.'

6803, Ben Carson Mistakenly Makes The Case NOT To Vote For Trump While On The Daily Show (VIDEO),"After dropping out of the Republican presidential race, Dr. Ben Carson made the quick shift to endorse Donald Trump. He insists that Trump is the best person for the job, besides himself of course, because he s an  outsider  who will supposedly get us away from the status quo. However, upon his recent visit to The Daily Show, Carson just made a perfect case against voting for Trump.Daily Show host Trevor Noah wasted absolutely no time in getting to the pressing question of why Carson chose to endorse Trump, saying the neurosurgeon must think  he can only be president for four years, so it can t be that bad. Carson s response was actually a far worse reason that Noah s joke, he said: What I actually said is that would be the worst-case scenario. Which left the audience not knowing whether to laugh or cry, and the sound that emanated from the crowd indicated it was probably a hybrid of the two.Yet, after discussing the supposed two different versions of Trump that exist, Carson said something that could make people stop and think twice before casting their ballot for Trump, because it s clear that Carson s vision of and for America is very different from that of the Republican front-runner s. He said: We are the child of every other nation, so we should have the welfare of every other nation at heart and conduct ourselves in a very different way. And if we can learn from them and we can conduct ourselves in a way that demonstrates compassion towards others, I believe that it can be a dawning of a new world. To which Noah responded as we all likely would with,  I hope Donald Trump is watching this show,  because that is certainly a message of inclusiveness that needs to be heard, and a far step away from the divisive, xenophobic rhetoric that Trump has been touting daily.It looks as though Carson may want to rethink who he s throwing his support behind.Watch the whole segment here:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"April 20, 2016"

Sadly, there are a large number of students who have bought into the whole  Peter Pan and the  I m never growing up  thing Remember these clowns who wore signs around their necks bemoaning the amount of money they WILLINGLY borrowed to pay for their education as a reason Americans should vote for Bernie? Per a survey of 500 college co-eds, LendEDU found that 31% of students, or roughly 2.4 million kids, admitted to using student loan money to fund their binge drinking trips to Cancun and Daytona Beach for spring break.According to the LendEDU poll, 30.60% of college students with student debt claim that they are using money they received from student loans to help pay for their spring break trip this year. For reference, you can use student loan funding for living expenses.The National Center for Education Statistics calculated that 20.5 million students will be attending college this year in the United States. Orbitz reported that 55% of students will be going on spring break. Using this data, we can roughly calculate that 11,275,000 students will be going on spring break this year.Factoring in our data, and assuming the claims made in our survey are accurate, this means that 2.38 million students are using money received from student loans to pay for their spring break excursion this year.Adding insult to injury, 24% of students admitted to using their student loan money for alcohol and 7% use those federally-subsidized checks for drugs.Nearly a quarter (23.80%) of respondents stated that they have used money received from student loans to pay for drinking some type of alcohol. This answer also included spending money at bars.A third (33.40%) of students answered that they have used money received from student loans to pay for clothing and other accessories.Similarly, the same amount (33.40%) of students said that they have used money received from student loans to pay for restaurants and take-out.6.60% of respondents responded saying that they have used money received from student loans to pay for drugs.Finally, 5.60% of students that participated in our survey stated that they used money received from student loans on gambling or sports betting.

19111,WHY DID OBAMA APPROVE $418 Million Sale Of U.S. Weapons To Kenya On His Last Day In Office…And Why Was The Contract Awarded To A Firm Who Never Produced One Of These Planes?,"A group of lawmakers is planning to request a congressional investigation of a $418 million U.S. weapons sale to Kenya approved by the Obama administration on its last day in office. The sale, approved by the State Department and privately notified to Congress on January 19, would allow Kenya to buy 14 weaponized crop-duster-like planes   including two trainer planes and services, for missions against terrorist group al-Shabaab.The deal was publicly announced the Monday after Trump s inauguration.A handful of lawmakers, led by Rep. Ted Budd (R-NC), are questioning why the contract to produce the planes was awarded to major defense firm L3 Technologies   which has never produced such a plane   while a smaller, disabled veteran-owned company in North Carolina that already make those planes at a lower cost was not considered.The L3 contract would primarily benefit its Platform Integration Division in Waco, Texas. An L3 spokesman did not respond to a phone call asking for comment.Budd said the current deal is not a good one for the Kenyans either. He met with the Kenyan Deputy Chief of Mission last Monday, who was allegedly  flabbergasted  they were potentially paying almost $200 million more than necessary.

Instead, the bacteria enters the body through the lungs, via water droplets in the air.On Wednesday Snyder officials claimed that they can neither confirm or deny that the outbreak is linked to the city s contaminated water supply.As The Atlantic reports here, the outbreak began shortly after the Snyder administration switched the city of Flint s water supply to the Flint River.According to the US Center for Disease Control (CDC) an outbreak of Legionnaire s Disease occurs when two or more people are infected with the bacteria.In Flint, almost ninety people are known to have been infected by the disease between June 2014 and November 2015.What s infuriating about the Legionnaire s outbreak in Flint is that officials in the Snyder administration certainly knew about it long before Wednesday s press conference. Yet they said nothing until now.As reported here, between June 2014 to March 2015, the number of confirmed cases of Legionnaire s Disease in Flint skyrocketed.During the previous five years the city saw a fairly steady number of cases of the disease, which averaged about eight to ten cases during a ten month reporting period.But by March of 2015, the number of confirmed cases had spiked to 4x the prior average. Between June 2014 and March 2015, there were 45 confirmed cases of the disease. Seven people died from Legionnaire s Disease during that ten month period.Yet after seeing this sudden increase, officials in the Snyder administration took no action. There was no effort made to identify a possible source, although the Center for Disease Control provides specific guidelines for doing so. The public was also not notified that there was an outbreak, although the state health department knew, or should have known, at least by March of last year, if not sooner.Between March of 2015 and November of 2015, another 42 cases of Legionnaire s Disease were confirmed in Flint. Three more people died after being exposed to the waterborne bacteria.Still there was no mention of an outbreak until January 13, 2016.Snyder s press conference on Wednesday was the first time any official made mention of a Legionnaire s outbreak in the city, although at least ten deaths have been caused by the disease.State officials virtually ignored this deadly outbreak for almost a year. Then all of the sudden, on Wednesday, Governor Snyder called a press conference to inform the public that there is an outbreak of Legionnaire s Disease in the city.The question of how state officials could have just now discovered something that has been going on for this long may not be difficult to answer.Last week the federal government announced a Justice Department probe into the Flint water crisis. The announcement followed an investigation by the ACLU, which revealed that state officials had falsified documents and rigged tests to cover up the fact that the city s water is contaminated with lead.Over 200 children are confirmed to have lead poisoning because of the actions of Snyder and his appointed representatives. An additional 9,000 children are likely to be impacted. The number of adults who are affected is currently unknown, but likely stretches into the thousands.A Justice Department investigation into the Flint water crisis would undoubtedly reveal that the Snyder administration concealed information on the Legionnaire s outbreak from the public.What else has Rick Snyder s administration been hiding and lying about? We may never know.Just as the Snyder administration was coming under intense scrutiny over the city s toxic water, someone allegedly broke into Flint City Hall. As Addicting Info reported here, the break-in conveniently targeted the vacant office where Flint s water records are stored.According to the CDC, a state health agency is responsible to conduct an investigation into the source of an Legionnaire s outbreak. Such an investigation is advised by the CDC any time there is an increase in the number of people who are diagnosed with the disease or an increase in the severity of cases (such as when the disease causes hospitalizations and deaths.)Outbreaks of Legionnaire s disease, such the one happening in Flint, would require an immediate investigation to determine the source as well as an urgent response from the state health department.Because of the timing and severity of the outbreak, which directly coincided with the switch of the water source, public health officials should have started an investigation into the source of the bacteria months ago. Instead they did nothing.State officials say they haven t made a  direct connection  between the city s contaminated water and the outbreak of the disease. That s more than likely because they never tried to identify the source of the outbreak. They just ignored it.Watch this video, recorded by club937 in January of last year, which shows the quality of the city s water.  We know that the water in Flint is contaminated with lead, a substance that causes a wide range of physical and mental disabilities, especially in children. We also know that the citizens of Flint were repeatedly told by the governor and members of his administration that the water was perfectly safe to drink.What s most frightening about the possibility that the city s water is the cause of the outbreak of Legionnaire s Disease is that people do not have to drink it to be exposed to the bacteria. This bacteria is associated with inhaling water particles, meaning that people can become deathly sick from simply bathing, showering, washing their hands or performing other tasks that most of us take for granted.Handing out bottled drinking water and lead filters isn t going to cut it.I cannot think of a single reason why the people of Flint would trust anything that Governor Snyder or members of his administration tell them about the water. They have been told lie after lie by this administration, ever since the city s water source was switched to the Flint River.What we can already say about the Legionnaire s outbreak is that state officials were aware of it months ago, yet they took no steps to protect public health. Ten people are dead.Snyder says he s not sure if the city s water is responsible for those deaths. That acknowledgment alone is enough to cause public outrage. It is his job to know. It was his job to know back in March, when there were already seven deaths attributed to this disease. But he didn t give a shit back in March. You know why? Because the federal government was not investigating Flint s water crisis back in March.Snyder and every member of his administration has got to go. Every shred of trust the public may have had in this administration is gone. It will never be back. No amount of PR from the governor s office is ever going to repair this.These are life and death issues for Flint residents. They need answers that they can trust, and they deserve to have representation that they can trust as they try to navigate their way through this incalculable nightmare.It was bad when they couldn t drink the water. Now there s a new threat looming over their heads, and that threat comes from the possibility that any contact with the water whatsoever could cause them to become deathly ill.These citizens cannot be expected to look to the same people who caused this disaster for answers now. They cannot be asked to trust the same administration that has lied to them over and over in the past, to tell them the truth now.Snyder and his administration are now saying they aren t sure if the city s water killed ten people. They don t exactly know if the water is safe to shower in, bathe in, wash your hands in. That s what they re saying now, when last week they said they were sure the water was safe for all of those things.At least a dozen petitions to recall Governor Rick Snyder have been filed in recent days. The Michigan Board of State Canvassers continues to throw the recall Snyder petitions out.Oddly enough the right wing majority board had no problem approving two Tea-Party backed recall petitions targeting state legislatures who voted in favor of a tax increase to help repair the state s dangerously neglected roads.To the citizens of Michigan I would ask, how many people have to get sick, and how many children have to be poisoned, and how many deaths have to be counted, before partisan political bullshit takes a backseat to the health and safety of your fellow citizens?You need to get this man, and every member of his blatantly corrupt administration out of office.*Featured image credit: Video screen capture club937.com",News,"January 14, 2016"
1490, Watergate Reporter Says Trump’s Russia Scandal Is Way WORSE Than Watergate (DETAILS),"James Fallows has been a journalist since 1972 and he covered the Watergate scandal so he knows what he s talking about.And when Fallows says that Donald Trump s ongoing and ever-growing Russia scandal is WORSE than Watergate, every American should take notice.That s exactly what Fallows did in a new article for The Atlantic published on Friday.Fallows remembers the Watergate scandal clearly despite the fact that it unfolded 45 years ago.The scandal is known as the Watergate scandal because some of President Richard Nixon s goons broke into the Democratic National Committee offices at the Watergate hotel.Nixon tried to cover up the crime by repeatedly lying and refusing to cooperate with investigations. He went so far as to fire Archibald Cox, the special prosecutor assigned to the investigation. Cox wanted Nixon to release White House recordings and Nixon refused. Nixon wanted Cox to back off but Cox refused. Nixon then fired him. After that, it was all downhill for Nixon. The Supreme Court ordered him to release the tapes and they were so damning that Nixon resigned before he could be impeached.But Trump s Russia scandal is worse. Based simply on what is known so far, this scandal looks worse than Watergate,  Fallows wrote.  Worse for and about the president. Worse for the overall national interest. Worse in what it suggests about the American democratic system s ability to defend itself. Fallows points out that Watergate was a mere burglary in an effort to find information on Nixon s political opponents. Trump s scandal, on the other hand, is:Nothing less than attacks by an authoritarian foreign government on the fundamentals of American democracy, by interfering with an election and doing so as part of a sustained effort that included parallel interference in the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and elsewhere. At worst, such efforts might actually have changed the election results. At least, they were meant to destroy trust in democracy. Not much of this is fully understood or proven, but the potential stakes are incomparably greater than what happened during Watergate, crime and cover-up alike.Fallows then compared Nixon s firing of Cox to Trump s firing of FBI Director James Comey.While Nixon  paid lip-service to the concept of due process and checks-and-balances  and at least acted like he was  sticking to some recognizable rules,  Trump s has openly disdained and flouted the rules. Nothing Donald Trump has done, on the campaign trail or in office, has expressed awareness of, or respect for, established rules,  Fallows continued.  Nixon s private comments could be vile, but nothing he said in public is comparable to Trump s dismissing James Comey as a  showboat,  or the thuggishly menacing tweet that Trump sent out today. The tweet Fallows referenced is a clear threat from Trump aimed at Comey in an effort to keep him from speaking to the press.James Comey better hope that there are no  tapes  of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 12, 2017And while Nixon was a  dark and complex  person who was  deeply knowledgeable  and  publicly disciplined  and possessed  political and strategic intelligence,  Trump has repeatedly proven that  he is impulsive, and ignorant, and apparently beyond the reach of any control, even his own. And what s also worse about Trump s Russia scandal is the way Republicans have circled the wagons around Trump and have made attempt after attempt to bury any investigations into his misconduct.While Republicans like Jason Chaffetz, Mitch McConnell, and Devin Nunes have all tried to sabotage investigations on Trump s behalf, it was Republicans like Charles Wiggins, Barry Goldwater, and Howard Baker who put their country before party and sided against Nixon.The Republicans who turned against Nixon will be remembered for doing the right thing when their country needed them most. Today s Republicans will only be remembered for doing nothing while their country burned to the ground. Fallows even points out that all it would take is three brave Republicans in the Senate to join Democrats to get a truly independent investigation rolling.The question is whether they actually care about their country, the Constitution, and the integrity of the office of the presidency enough to do so.Our country needs heroes now more than ever. Republicans could be those heroes if they would just stop being cowards and stop being Trump s puppets.Featured Image: Olivier Douliery-Pool/Getty Images",News,"May 12, 2017"
21995,MSM Fake News: How Washington Post Sexed-up its ‘Facebook Russian Bot’ Conspiracy,"This is a story about how once trusted mainstream media outlets like Washington Post and the New York Times have used their vast platforms to distort reality and spread disinformation en masse   to both the American and global public. It s also a story about a new  excuse industry  which has sprung up to medicate Hillary Clinton s tragic defeat.The article below, written by award-winning journalist Robert Parry, reveals the shocking extent to which the establishment is willing to go to achieve both domestic political, and international geopolitical outcomes.In September, we were told by multiple US mainstream media that  suspected Russian operators  used Facebook and Twitter accounts to spread  anti-Clinton  messages which somehow affected the electoral outcome in 2016. This was followed by a dramatic announcement by Facebook officials that they had responded to the crisis by  shutting down  several hundred accounts (approx. 470) suspected to have been created by a firm  linked to the Kremlin  who used  Russian bot  accounts to purchase $100,000 worth of Facebook post ads   3,000 ads in total   over a 3 year period (that s only $33,000 per year) which we re told were  pushing divisive issues during and after the American election campaign  (so said the New York Times).As it turns out, the story was not only wildly exaggerated, it provided a convenient smoke screen to cover-up another case of real collusion.The scale of American propaganda is simply breathtaking.In this single passage taken from the recent New York Times  scoop  on the alleged  Facebook Russian Bot  phenomenon, you can see the full compliment of packaged lies which has become a set piece in US mainstream discourse now: The Russian information attack on the election did not stop with the hacking and leaking of Democratic emails or the fire hose of stories, true, false and in between, that battered Mrs. Clinton on Russian outlets like RT and Sputnik. Far less splashy, and far more difficult to trace, was Russia s experimentation on Facebook and Twitter, the American companies that essentially invented the tools of social media and, in this case, did not stop them from being turned into engines of deception and propaganda. It gets worse though. What the Washington Post and others like the New York Times have obscured from the American people through this massive propaganda exercise   is the Obama Administration and partisan Democrats  own role in helping to generate this contrived conspiracy, or fake news. In the absence of any actual evidence of  collusion  between the Trump campaign and Russia   what we have now is a case of Silicon Valley giant Facebook, actually colluding with the White House and the Federal government officials in order to help fabricate a highly politicized false conviction. Here are some of the main points in the article below:  Powerful politicians pressured Facebook executives to come up with any evidence to support the Democratic Party s theory of  Russian meddling.  The Washington Post and others tried to convince a naive portion of the public to believe that somehow $100,000 in transient Facebook ad impacted the tens of billions of dollars spent during U.S. political spending for the 2016 election cycle.  With all of the hype about  Russian operatives,  the mainstream media has not produced evidence to show who bought the ads.As journalistic hoaxes go, this is one of the biggest we ve seen.Perhaps an even bigger fraud in all of this however, is how a corporate mainstream media outlet like the Washington Post can use it s unlimited resources and media might to push out a blatantly fake narrative, intentionally distorted to deceive the public in order to achieve some partisan political objective   and then site on the board of the establishment s  First Draft  project which they claim is leading the fight against  fake news . How can a major purveyor of fake news be left to lead the fight to  tackle fake news ?  This is the danger of allowing an establishment cartel comprising of the corporate media, Facebook, Google and other tech monopolies   to devise their own information policing regime.More on this incredible story from award-winning Consortium News here . . By Robert ParrySome people are calling the anti-Russian hysteria being whipped up across the U.S. mainstream news media a new  golden age of American journalism,  although it looks to me more like a new age of yellow journalism, prepping the people for more military spending, more  information warfare  and more actual war.Yes, without doubt, President Trump is a boorish and dangerous demagogue, now highlighted by his reckless speech before the United Nations last week, his schoolyard Tweet taunts toward North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, and his ugly denunciation of black athletes for protesting against police killings of often unarmed African-Americans.And, yes, I know that some people feel that the evidence-lite and/or false allegations about  Russian meddling  are the golden ticket to Trump s impeachment. But the unprofessional behavior of The New York Times, The Washington Post and pretty much the entire mainstream media regarding Russia-gate cannot be properly justified by the goal of removing Trump from office.Ethically in journalism, the ends   however much you might wish them to succeed   cannot justify the means, if those means involve violating rules of evidence and principles of fairness. Journalism should be a place where all sides get a fair shake, not where some get a bum s rush.But the U.S. mainstream media has clearly joined the anti-Trump Resistance and hates Russian President Vladimir Putin, too. So, we are given such travesties of journalism as appeared as a banner headline across the front page of Monday s Washington Post, another screed about how Russia supposedly used Facebook ads to flip last November s election for Trump.The article purports to give the inside story of how Facebook belatedly came to grips with how the  company s social network played a key role in the U.S. election,  but actually it is a story about how powerful politicians bullied Facebook into coming up with something   anything   to support the narrative of  Russian meddling,  including direct interventions by President Obama and Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee and a key legislator regarding regulation of high-tech industries.Finding the  Evidence In other words, Facebook was sent back again and again to find what Obama and Warner wanted the social media company to find. Eventually, Facebook turned up $100,000 in ads from 2015 into 2017 that supposedly were traced somehow to Russia. These ads apparently addressed political issues in America although Facebook has said most did not pertain directly to the presidential election and some ads were purchased after the election.Left out of the Post s latest opus is what a very small pebble these ads were   even assuming that Russians did toss the $100,000 or so in ad buys into the very large lake of billions of dollars in U.S. political spending for the 2016 election cycle. It also amounts to a miniscule fraction of Facebook s $27 billion in annual revenue.So the assertion that this alleged  meddling    and we ve yet to see any evidence connecting these ads to the Russian government    played a key role in the U.S. election  is both silly and outrageous, especially given the risks involved in stoking animosities between nuclear-armed Russia and nuclear-armed America.Facebook: Colluding with government.Even the Post s alarmist article briefly acknowledges that it is still unclear who bought the ads, referring to the purchasers as  suspected Russian operatives.  In other words, we don t even know that the $100,000 in ads over three years came from Russians seeking to influence the U.S. election. (By comparison, many Facebook advertisers   even some small businesses   spend $100,000 per day on their ads, not $100,000 over three years.)But this diminutive effort by  suspected Russian operatives doesn t stop the Post from going on and on about  fake news  and  disinformation,  albeit again without offering evidence or specifics of any Russian  fake news  or  disinformation. It has simply become Official Washington s new groupthink to say that everything linked to Russia or its international TV network RT is  fake news  or  disinformation  even though examples are lacking or often turn out to be false accusations themselves.For instance, there is nothing in the Post s article acknowledging that nothing from the various Democratic email disclosures, which have been blamed on Russia (again without real evidence), has been identified as untrue. So, how can truthful information, whether you like how it was obtained or not, be  fake news  or  disinformation ?Falsehood as FactBut Monday s Post expos  simply asserts the claim as flat fact. Or as the article asserts:  what Russian operatives posted on Facebook was, for the most part, indistinguishable from legitimate political speech. The difference was the accounts that were set up to spread the misinformation and hate were illegitimate. In responsible journalism, such an accusation would be followed by a for-instance, giving an example of  the misinformation and hate  that the  Russian operatives    note how they have been magically transformed from  suspected Russian operatives  to simply  Russian operatives    were disseminating.But there is no example of the Russian  misinformation and hate,  a classic violation of the reporting principle of  show, don t tell.  In this story, it s all tell and no show.Indeed, what is shown in the article is often contradictory to the story s conclusion. The article says, for instance,  A review by the company found that most of the groups behind the problematic pages had clear financial motives, which suggested that they weren t working for a foreign government. But amid the mass of data the company was analyzing, the security team did not find clear evidence of Russian disinformation or ad purchases by Russian-linked accounts. So, Facebook initially   after extensive searching   did not find evidence of a Russian operation. Then, after continued pressure from high-level Democrats, Facebook continued to scour its system and again found nothing, or as the Post article acknowledged, Facebook  had searched extensively for evidence of foreign purchases of political advertising but had come up short. That prompted Warner to fly out to Silicon Valley to personally press Facebook executives to come up with the evidence to support the Democrats  theory about Russia paying for carefully targeted anti-Clinton ads in key districts.The Post s article reported that  Finally, [Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex] Stamos appealed to Warner for help: If U.S. intelligence agencies had any information about the Russian operation or the troll farms it used to disseminate misinformation, they should share it with Facebook. The company is still waiting, people involved in the matter said. Under PressureStill, faced with extraordinary pressure from senior Democrats, Facebook finally delivered the desired results, or as the Post reported,  By early August, Facebook had identified more than 3,000 ads addressing social and political issues that ran in the United States between 2015 and 2017 and that appear to have come from accounts associated with the [St. Petersburg, Russia-based] Internet Research Agency. So, the ads covering three years, including post-election 2017, only  appear  to be  associated  with some private Russian operation that only allegedly has ties to the Kremlin. And the total sums of the ad buys are infinitesimal compared to what it actually takes to have any real impact on Facebook or in a U.S. presidential election.If the context of this story were changed slightly   say, it was about the U.S. government trying to influence public opinion in another country (which actually does happen quite a bit)   the Post would be among the first news outlets to laugh off such allegations or dismiss the vague accusations as a conspiracy theory, but since these allegations fit with the prejudices of the Post s editors, an entirely different set of journalistic standards is applied.What the article also ignores is the extraordinary degree of coercion that such high-level political pressure can put on a company that recognizes its vulnerability to government regulation.As Facebook has acknowledged in corporate filings,  Action by governments to restrict access to Facebook in their countries could substantially harm our business and financial results. It is possible that governments of one or more countries may seek to censor content available on Facebook in their country, restrict access to Facebook from their country entirely, or impose other restrictions that may affect the accessibility of Facebook in their country for an extended period of time or indefinitely.  In the event that access to Facebook is restricted, in whole or in part, in one or more countries or our competitors are able to successfully penetrate geographic markets that we cannot access, our ability to retain or increase our user base and user engagement may be adversely affected, we may not be able to maintain or grow our revenue as anticipated, and our financial results could be adversely affected. Avoiding RealityIn other words, another way to have framed this story is that powerful politicians who could severely harm Facebook s business model were getting in the face of Facebook executives and essentially demanding that they come up with something to support the Democratic Party s theory of  Russian meddling. The Democratic leaders wanted this finding as an explanation for Hillary Clinton s (image, left) stunning defeat, rather than going through the painful process of examining why the party has steadily lost ground in white working-class areas across the country.What is missed in these Russia-bashing articles is that the Democratic brand has been sinking for years, including massive losses in statehouses across the country as well as in Congress. The party s decline was not a one-off event with Donald Trump suddenly snaking away with significant parts of the white working class because the Russians bought some Facebook ads.However, instead of looking in the mirror, national Democrats demanded that Facebook executives ferret out whatever tiny or imaginary information there might be about some Russians buying Facebook ads   and then allow those coerced findings to be fed into the excuse industry for why Hillary Clinton lost.And, what about the Post s repeated accusations about Russia engaging in  disinformation  and  fake news  without offering a single example? Apparently, these assertions have become such articles of faith in the U.S. mainstream media that they don t require any proof.However, honest journalism demands examples and evidence, not just vague accusations. The reality is that the U.S. government has stumbled again and again when seeking to paint RT as a disinformation outlet or a vehicle for undermining American democracy.For instance, the Jan. 6 report on alleged Russian  cyber operations,  released by Obama s Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, included a lengthy appendix, dated from 2012, which decried RT for such offenses as allowing a debate among third-party presidential candidates who had been excluded from the Republican-Democratic debates; covering the Occupy Wall Street protests; and citing the environmental dangers from  fracking. The idea that American democracy is threatened by allowing third-party candidates or other American dissidents to have a voice is at best an upside-down understanding of democracy and, more likely, an exercise in hypocritical propaganda.False AccusationsAnother misfired attempt to discredit RT came from Obama s Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy Richard Stengel, who issued a  Dipnote  in April 2014, which helped establish the narrative of RT as a source of Russian disinformation.For instance, Stengel claimed that RT reported a  ludicrous assertion  that the United States had spent $5 billion to produce Ukraine s  regime change  in February 2014.But what Stengel, a former managing editor of Time magazine, apparently failed to understand was that RT was referring to a public speech by Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs Victoria Nuland to U.S. and Ukrainian business leaders on Dec. 13, 2013, in which she told them that  we have invested more than $5 billion  in what was needed for Ukraine to achieve its  European aspirations.  In other words, the RT report wasn t  ludicrous  at all.Nuland also was a leading proponent of  regime change  in Ukraine who personally cheered on the Maidan demonstrators, even passing out cookies. In an intercepted pre-coup phone call with U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt, Nuland discussed who should run the new government and pondered with Pyatt how to  glue  or  midwife this thing. So, Stengel was the one disseminating false information, not RT.Similarly, senior U.S. politicians, including Hillary Clinton, and the U.S. mainstream media have falsely asserted that all 17 U.S. intelligence agencies signed off on the Russia-did-it hacking claims.For months, that canard was used to silence skepticism. After all, how could you question something that all 17 U.S. intelligence agencies confirmed to be true?But it turned out that   as DNI Clapper, himself a hardline Russia-basher, belatedly acknowledged   the Jan. 6 report on the alleged Russian hacking was the work of  hand-picked  analysts from only three agencies, the CIA, FBI and NSA, and the  assessment  itself admitted that it was not asserting the Russian conclusion as fact, only the analysts  opinion.The New York Times finally retracted its use of the fake claim about  all 17 U.S. intelligence agencies  in late June 2017 although it wouldn t let the lie lie, so instead the Times made misleading references to a  consensus  among U.S. intelligence agencies without using the number Continue this story at Consortium NewsREAD MORE RUSSIAGATE NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Russiagate FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE  SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @ 21WIRE.TV",US_News,"September 26, 2017"
8589, This One Image Reveals The Right-Wing Racism That Fueled Flint’s Water Crisis (IMAGES),"The human rights debacle that is being referred to as the Flint water crisis has just been summed up perfectly by political cartoonist Matt Wuerker, who found a brilliant way to express the true underlying issues behind this massive issue in one powerful image:Cartoon by Matt WuerkerThanks to the irresponsible, neglectful actions of Republican governor Rick Snyder and Emergency Manager Darnell Earley, a city with over 100,000 residents   the majority of which are African American   has been poisoned. Almost a dozen people have died from Legionnaire s Disease as a result, with dozens more becoming seriously ill.As more evidence surfaces, Snyder s disturbing role in the crisis has become crystal clear, adding to the outrage as many call for Snyder to resign and be held accountable for allowing this to happen to Flint. Among those speaking out is filmmaker and Flint native Michael Moore, who called Snyder out for having  knowingly poisoned a black city  and  racial killing. Flint homeowners have been lied to and were told that their tap water   which in some areas is polluted enough to meet the EPA s standards for toxic waste   was safe to drink, even though it was discolored.Twitter TwitterThe damage that Snyder s carelessness has caused is irreversible, and it will take 10-15 years for the real damage of the lead-poisoned, highly corrosive water to be calculated. For the children of Flint, this could be deadly. It s not just homeowners that have been affected either   even hospitals are without safe water.TwitterWe cannot ignore the fact that Flint is a predominately black city with a large low-income population.Even as more evidence is gathered, many GOPers in Michigan (aside from Snyder) are calling the water crisis a hoax. Republican L. Brooks Patterson has even called reputable reports of the lead poisoning  false . Earlier today, Snyder said that race played no role in the water crisis when asked a question from a New York Times article that asked,  If Flint were rich and mostly white, would Michigan s state government have responded more quickly and aggressively to complaints about its lead-polluted water?  He s lying through his teeth.Featured image via Matt Wuerker",News,"January 22, 2016"
22719,ABC News Suspend Anchor Brian Ross Over Fake News Report on Trump-Flynn ‘Russian Collusion’,"After 18 months of rampant speculation over Trump and  Russian collusion  and alleged  Russian hacking  in the 2016 election, in a cloud of non-stop, 24/7 fake news being generated by CNN, ABC, NBC, CBS, Washington Post, New York Times, LA Times, as well as notorious MSM fake news outsourcing agencies like The Daily Beast   the Never Trump Resistance has yet to present a single item of evidence to justify their year and a half-long political witch hunt.In this sea of delusion, there are still a number of desperate media persons who are willing to punt on a contrived plot or narrative   hoping that theirs will be  the one  to finally nail the embattled President on grounds for impeachment beyond a reasonable doubt. Already a number of mainstream journalists, including three reporters from CNN, have been fired or let go as networks are now fear legal repercussions from their new normalized practice of lying and inventing plots about the White House and  Russian meddling. This week saw another high-profile casualty, ABC s Chief Investigative Correspondent Brian Ross, as the  resistance  continues to launch blind media attacks on the President.On Saturday, ABC News executives announced that star anchor Ross would be suspended for one month without pay over an alleged  botched   exclusive  implicating former national security adviser Michael Flynn.Clueless: ABC s Chief Investigative Correspondent Brian Ross.During Ross s live  special report , an invented story-line was fed to a clueless Ross which claimed that Flynn would testify that Donald Trump had  ordered him  to make contact with Russians about foreign policy   while Trump was still a candidate in the general election.According to FOX News, the fake news report  raised the specter of Trump s impeachment and sent the stock market plummeting. Later in the day, ABC issued a  clarification  to Ross s report, saying that Trump s alleged directive came after he d been elected president. Ross himself appeared on  World News Tonight,  several hours after the initial report, to clarify his error.Afterwards, ABC News tried to justify the fake news release, claiming that Ross  report  had not been fully vetted through our editorial standards process. Clearly, Ross took one for the team (The Resistance) here, as anyone who works in media will know. He would have been fed the bogus report by news producers, before doing what mainstream media news anchors do everyday of their careers   unwittingly reading whatever words are scrolling down his teleprompter.ABC News statement went on to try and gloss over their fake news report saying,  It is vital we get the story right and retain the trust we have built with our audience. News officials then sounded even more ridiculous as they scrambled to pave-over their propaganda practices claiming that,  These are our core principles. We fell far short of that yesterday. What s clear from this story is that when it comes to all things Trump and Russia, the US mainstream media feel they are within their right to dispense with all normal journalistic standards so long as the story falls in line with a specific political agenda.Unfortunately, this is just one more reason to always be cautious when trusting watching mainstream media reporting of any any major news event.READ MORE ABOUT MAINSTREAM FAKE NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Fake News FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE   SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV ",Middle-east,"December 5, 2017"

If that sounds like a strange thing to do you aren t alone. Even among conservatives, some have pushed back on Beck s suggestion.In response, Beck is now saying that the backlash proves that the church is  dead.  He wrote a message to his followers on Facebook as part of his push back:Since when has a fast and prayer been crazy?It was standard practice to beseech the powers of heaven for not just your country but personal guidance and revelation at one time.Have we really become a nation that mocks those who pray and fast?The sad answer is yes.I am not telling you who to vote for. I am asking people to pray and humble themselves before the Lord. If you wish to do that for your candidate please do so. God will not answer you or me. With prayer and fasting, approached with humility and a broken heart, we may fall closer into alignment with His will.Beck goes on to say that  we are closer to losing our nation and Liberty than we were on September 11th.  In his view, candidates like Marco Rubio and Donald Trump are not pure of heart enough to save America the way that Ted Cruz would.Beck is prone to dramatics and oddball announcements   which are part of the reason he was eventually let go from Fox News.Having a freak out over Ted Cruz s lackluster performance is just the latest episode of Beck having a tantrum when he doesn t get his own way.Featured image via YouTube",News,"February 21, 2016"
15811,"LOW FLUSH TOILETS, DELTA SMELT, PAYOFFS, NEIGHBORHOOD SNITCHES AND STATISTS…Why The Radical Left Is Lying About A Water Crisis In CA","Dr. Gina Loudon is hands down one of our favorite conservative writers. She nails it with this piece about the truth behind the lies of the California drought I found it supremely ironic this week that two of the big stories were about a man-made lack of water in California, and a man lost in a vast sea off of Florida.Gov. Jerry  Moonbeam  Brown announced the dire circumstances, not from the Capitol in Sacramento, but from the dramatic backdrop of a mountaintop. His narrative held that there should be five feet of  snow pack,  but alas, there was none. Brown, and the radical Marxists, couched as  environmentalists  he represents, have convinced most Americans to hold two radically opposing views simultaneously. Ostensibly, California is in danger of being flooded by rising sea levels caused by global warming and melting polar ice caps, and it is also utterly out of water.There is no shortage of water. This is an environmentalist-created drought that is costing billions.I waver between utter disgust and admiration when I watch how the leftists sell these things, always with straight faces. Every major news outlet in America and many around the world swallowed the narrative like fish on a baited hook. They tell us there is no water, no snow to provide water for the summer, and the farmers are taking too much so people must suffer. There is an all-out war on grass, and no one is safe. Sorry, Shaggy, your  grass  is to blame as well.There is hand wringing in every club house as the boards are told they are coming for the rough grass, your fairways and greens are safe, for now. Evil rich guys in colorful knickers and almond farmers in overalls are the scourge of California. Off with their heads! Oh, and you can forget about the luxury of children playing on the lawn. If you want that, you breeders should move to flyover land! Don t you dare sneak and water the backyard after dark; Brown makes it easy for your neighbors to snitch on you. I m not making this up. They really have a state hotline for that.Those of us who pay attention know well the proverb,  Where there is no vision, the people perish.  The people who built California into the greatest agricultural producer in America gave us dams, canals, reservoirs and all kinds of conveyance of water. They harnessed the rivers that reach from the Pacific Northwest down well into Northern California and even draw water to the Golden State from the Colorado River. That was then. Nothing has changed since then, except political power.For the last several decades, the radical fringe has taken full control of California, and it hates people. Dennis Prager observed that statists love humanity but hate humans. Watch how they latch onto dreams of egalitarian states but begin the execution of their plans by marginalizing, isolating and then executing anyone who disagrees with them. They dine in the finest restaurants in San Francisco, the likes of Brown, Pelosi, Boxer and Feinstein, planning lawsuits to cut the flow of water to the farms of Central California and the people in Southern California, caring not a wit that 40,000 agricultural workers, mostly Hispanic, are unemployed.Just this week, in the middle of a human crisis, federal fish agents ordered the release of billions of gallons of water purportedly to save six fish. You read that right. Not to save six species of fish, but literally, six fish. Apparently, these special six stood their, err ground, and when 29 of their compadres rode the 10 billion gallon man-made wave to the ocean in March, they refused to go with the flow (sorry).You can t make this stuff up. But when you do, people actually believe it.So Obama administration agents want a second toilet flush to give these hard-headed steelheads a second nudge. The idea that nature itself may be holding the fish where they are is of no concern to statists who love telling both man and beast what they think is good for them. Sadly, this latest mind-boggling atrocity is getting very little media coverage. I found excellent coverage in the Manteca Bulletin. Why hasn t the Los Angeles Times reported on this?The current shortage is based primarily on the release of billions of gallons daily into the San Francisco Bay to sustain the bait fish known as the Delta smelt. This is a simple distribution issue; there is plenty of water.Prior to the statists taking over California, massive pumps were diverting water from rivers into the canal system (built before Brown and his ilk took control of the state). They have all but turned these pumps off to protect the fish from their Darwinian demise, and billions upon billions of gallons of fresh water is continuously dumped into the ocean.For the people-hating San Francisco cabal, cutting off water from the people is the real goal. They want fewer people to begin with, but the ultimate goal is control. Few environmentalists admit it publicly, but they want zero farming in the central valley, preferring to  allow  land to return to its prehistoric state. The cabal wants to control water so they can control people. Brown is just the messenger today. He is telling America that water access is a privilege, he has the power to pick winners and losers, and we have to just take it.If Brown decides tomorrow that he wants to withhold water from almond farmers, Americans will just have to accept it. Have you ever wondered why any business owner would give campaign donations to Marxist, business-hating politicians? Now you know why. They must give to buy protection. Business owners do not donate to Brown, Pelosi or Harry Reid because those politicians are good for business; they give to be sure they are not the next targets.The problem with all of this is that water is a limitless natural resource. Just ask the sailor who faced drowning daily or the people in the Midwest who were deluged this week. It is one thing to argue for conservation of animals, or even trees, or  green space,  but water? Water is a limitless natural resource. Not even the most self-important leftist believes he could make water go away, no matter how hard he tried. How did they convince us to accept this lie?They got us to buy the lie that water is scarce by telling it often enough and pounding it into generations of schoolchildren. Using federal law and acts of Congress, they forced people from water-soaked regions to accept low flush or what some call  two flush  toilets the same as desert-dwelling Californians. And we fell for it. At least the Democrats among us fell for it.Thus it is that Brown got to have his cake and eat it, too. He told Californians, and really all Americans and the world, that lack of water was not his fault for lacking the vision to feed the distribution system created by the real men who built California. He repeats that it is not the fault of the Marxists  Endangered Species Act that prefers hard-headed fish over people. The lack of water is the result of the lack of  snow pack,  which is the result of  climate change,  which is the result of greedy people being well, people. The Delta smelt and steelhead trout must live and we mere humans should all just die.Meanwhile, Jerry Brown is committed to spending $100 billion for trains, but he has made zero commitment to allowing water to flow to people instead of fish, and zero commitment to finding funding for his  twin tunnels  alternate solution. And why would he? We are cutting back our water use, ratting on our neighbors and accepting higher produce prices across America. The Marxists in San Francisco are toasting total victory. The farmers and country club board members are suing for peace. Lord help usVia: WND",politics,"Apr 17, 2015"
12533,CAMPAIGNING WHILE DRUNK? Video Showing Hillary Dancing Reopens “Booze Swilling” Past [Video],"Hillary Clinton was reportedly drunk at a rally in New Jersey according to several sources but you be the judge: Rumors of Hillary Clinton s chronic alcohol use have been swirling around the politician for years, but have proven especially rampant this campaign season with the focus and national debate on the Democrat s lingering health issues. And for good reason. Wikileaks recently released an email chain where her aides talked of sobering up the Democratic presidential candidate.An Aug. 2015 email from communications aide Jennifer Palmieri instructs campaign chairman John Podesta to locate and sober Hillary up so that she can return or respond to documents that were emailed to her hours before. I think you should call her and sober her up some,  Palmieri said.The Wikileaks email chain between Palmieri and Podesta shows that Clinton was not reachable throughout the entire afternoon on Aug 8. Additionally, other emails released by Wikileaks and Judicial Watch indicate Clinton sleeps well into mid afternoon on many days and as secretary of state, overslept and missed key national security meetings and daily briefings.New York Times national reporter Amy Chozick covered the Clinton s vicious primary campaign in 2008 against Barack Obama. In a 2015 profile for ABC News about Clinton, Chozick said she was surprised how much booze Clinton swilled on the campaign trail. Chozick said: Hmm. She likes to drink. We were on the campaign trail in 2008 and the press thought she was just taking shots to pander to voters in Pennsylvania. Um, no. Clinton family insider and campaign manager at the time in 2008, Terry McAuliffe, now governor of Virginia, concurred: She loves to sit, throw  em back. So to me this is nothin  new,  McAuliffe said.  We all hear about the story that she and John McCain actually had a shot contest, I think in the Ukraine or somewhere around the world. And she actually beat John McCain in a shot contest. She s a girl from Illinois who likes to throw  em down with the rest of us.

2489, WATCH: Morning Joe Hosts Wipe The Floor With Trump’s Chaotic Lie-Infested Press Conference,"It s safe to say that Donald Trump and Joe Scarborough are no longer buddies.After an embarrassing first solo press conference in which Trump repeatedly lied and called the media  fake news  while bragging about himself and claiming that his administration is a well-oiled machine, Joe Scarborough was gauging what his Republican lawmaker friends were thinking and they are starting to understand why millions of Americans are frightened.Mika Brzezinski reacted to Trump s words by saying  And the public doesn t believe US anymore? Scarborough lambasted the entire conference, telling the Morning Joe panel on Friday that it  would have been a really funny hour or so of television if he weren t President of the United States. It was one of the most chaotic, rambling press conferences anybody has ever seen,  he continued.Indeed, Saturday Night Live has their work cut out for them if they plan to spoof Trump s conference this weekend. Because they could literally just play the real conference and take the night off.Scarborough has also seen a lot of presidential press conferences, both as part of the media and a former lawmaker. When he says this is the  most chaotic, rambling press conference,  he s not kidding.Scarborough then noted that Trump s hardcore supporters are going to support him no matter what.Panelist Mike Barnicle then chimed in that Trump has lost touch with reality. Yesterday, the first 35 minutes of that press conference was watching a President of the United States who has lost a grip on reality. It was as if he performed for himself because he needed to perform like that because he needed to convince himself he was president. Indeed, Trump spent minutes talking about his Electoral College win as if it was the greatest win in history in an apparent effort to convince everyone of his legitimacy. Except that it wasn t as  yuuuge  as Trump says because his win ranks as one of the smallest on record and he lost the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes. Trump was even called out by NBC reporter Peter Alexander over the lie. He says things that are verifiably false,  Scarborough said before adding,  Everybody I talked to on the hill, including a lot of Republican senators and congressmen, were scared to death by what they saw. And more than one said,  This just isn t going to last long because he just doesn t have control of reality. The Morning Joe host then went on to say that many Republicans are absolutely  freaked out  because of Trump s embarrassing press conference.Here s the video via YouTube:It s clear that Donald Trump is unfit to be president and if Republicans have even a splinter of spine left they will do the right thing for America and impeach him before we become even more of a laughingstock to the world.Featured image via screenshot",News,"February 17, 2017"
4665, Wells Fargo To Give Strikingly Fat Reward To Top Exec For Ripping Off Customers,"Wells Fargo, one of the biggest banks in the U.S., was recently caught running a scam known as  sandbagging,  to inflate bankers  numbers and get them more money. Basically, they were opening fake accounts and transferring customers  money into those accounts without their authorization. They ve been slapped with $185 million in fines, but the executive who is most closely and directly linked to this scam is walking away with a nice, fat reward for it at the end of the year, when she retires.Carrie Tolstedt, the head of Wells Fargo s Scamming Department, will receive almost $125 million at the end of this year despite being in charge of a department that ripped off its customers to inflate its own bottom lines. Of course, as is standard procedure whenever a big company is caught ripping people off, Wells Fargo isn t admitting any wrongdoing, even though this has been going on for the last five years.Tolstedt herself isn t saying anything about it, either, but Wells Fargo is praising her service, saying she s been  a standard bearer of our culture  and  a champion for customers. Yeah, right, charging your customers fees they don t owe because you put their money into accounts they didn t open to inflate your bottom line is being a champion for customers. At least the head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau saw right through that drivel: It is quite clear that [the actions of Tolstedt s unit] are unfair and abusive practices under federal law,  said Cordray.  They are a violation of trust and an abuse of trust.' Wells Fargo has fired some 5,300 employees for these tactics, but their clawback provision, which they expanded after the 2008 financial crash, didn t seem to deter this department, and they kept up these secret and deceptive practices. It s bad enough that Elizabeth Warren, who s been after the big banks since she was elected in 2012, wants hearings into Wells Fargo s sandbagging. She doesn t believe Wells Fargo didn t know about the fake accounts any more than anyone with any sense does: Come on this went on for years and they didn t smell anything in the air about fake accounts? And if they did, she believes, then Wells Fargo is too big to manage. Either way, they defrauded their customers and should pay. As should the head of their department.Instead, Wells Fargo has decided to send a message to other banking executives that this kind of behavior is okay. It s the same problem we ve had with the big banks since before 2008. Tolstedt should be fired, and walk away with nothing.Featured image by Joe Raedle/Getty Images",News,"September 12, 2016"
6612, Obama Invades Iran With A Moderate Reformist Government–Defies GOP Logic Of Democracy Via War,"How many times more are we going to get to say this before 2017?  While Republicans were bashing Obama for <insert situation here>, he was busy taking care of the same problem they were crying about better than they ever could have hoped to do.  This is a common theme between Republicans and President Obama. Every time President Obama does something good, they call it the biggest disaster imaginable. Do they think we re not watching?Remember during President Obama s Iranian nuclear deal, when Republicans said  going easy  on Iran (translation   not invading their country) would only make them a worse threat?Huge shock incoming: literally nothing Republicans swore would happen from the Iran deal happened. In fact, yet again the exact opposite happened.The latest proof of President Obama s phenomenal and historic success comes with news of the recent Iranian elections. Supporters of Hassan Rouhani swept to power in run-off elections that gave the Iranian moderate reformist movement legislative control of the Iranian parliament for the first time in over 10 years.Forty-two percent of the total seats were won by Rouhani s moderate supporters. Independents took nearly 30 percent of the remaining seats, and the vast majority of them are also moderate reformists. This leaves a paltry 28 percent left for the Iranian hardliners, which essentially amounts to a seat at the  kid s table,  where their rhetoric means diddly squat and they can do no legislative harm.The landslide success of the Iranian moderate reformists has been linked directly to the success of the nuclear agreement reached between President Rouhani and the United States. The deal brought a great amount of both social and financial relief to the people of Iran, and Rouhani s big win is being viewed as an endorsement of it by the Iranian people.The seriousness of this would be difficult to overstate. President Obama not only won on the Iran deal, but he helped move into place a reformist government that could carry things far beyond the deal alone.As if the electoral results were not enough of a statement for a more moderate future in Iran, the first priority of the new government is going to be a bill to guarantee citizens  rights. This is IRAN we are talking about. The idea of citizen rights being the first priority for a newly elected government is astounding, considering they were viewed by most of the world as a terrorist state for decades.While Iran won t be turning into a mirror image of the West anytime soon, just the fact that the nation took such a huge pivot so quickly is all anyone needs to know when it comes to how President Obama did on the Iran deal.Republicans just can t win when it comes to President Obama. Every time they bash the hell out of him in the media for handling a situation poorly, he literally does the exact opposite   quite often simultaneously   while the rest of the world laughs at the GOP. We sure are going to miss him.Featured image via Getty",News,"May 1, 2016"

You are witnessing the single greatest WITCH HUNT in American political history   led by some very bad and conflicted people! #MAGA  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 15, 2017Boy, was Trump ever correct!GP   Robert Mueller continued with his now widely reported corrupt and criminal activities last night by leaking information sealed by the courts to CNN. This is just another corrupt and criminal act in Mueller s corrupt and criminal career.Last night we found out from information leaked to CNN that the Mueller investigation has filed charges in the ongoing superfluous investigation into President Trump and the far out possibility that he colluded with Russia in the 2016 election. CNN reported that:A federal grand jury in Washington, DC, on Friday approved the first charges in the investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller, according to sources briefed on the matter. The charges are still sealed under orders from a federal judge.In typical bad cop form, former FBI Head and current Special Counsel Mueller proved again that he is as dirty as it gets.Trump came out today after the crooked deep-state with these series of tweets:Never seen such Republican ANGER & UNITY as I have concerning the lack of investigation on Clinton made Fake Dossier (now $12,000,000?), .

Is this coincidental? NOT! All of this ""Russia"" talk right when the Republicans are making their big push for historic Tax Cuts & Reform. Is this coincidental? NOT!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 29, 2017Mueller s career is littered with numerous investigations of major scandals and likely crimes that he did not meaningfully investigate as FBI Director resulting in no arrests and no consequences. All of these resulted in the Clintons and/or Obama Administration getting away with criminal activities:IRS Targeting (2010-2013): the IRS intentionally selected and then delayed or denied tax-exempt 501(c)(3) applications from conservative groups to prevent them from participating in the 2012 election, followed by IRS agent Lois Lerner invoking her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. (No charges have been filed of any wrong doing by any government officials in this case.)Fast and Furious (2010): this ATF program, which seems to have served no rational purpose, allowed over 2,000 guns to be purchased illegally inside the United States and then  walked  into Mexico for use by criminals, one of which was later used in the 2010 murder of Border Agent Brian Terry by the member of a Mexican cartelAssociated Press Spying (2012): the Department of Justice illegally seized the communications of AP reporters made during April and May 2012, allowing the DOJ to unmask journalists  confidential sourcesClinton Foundation Pay-for-Play (2009-2013): during the period in which Hillary Clinton held the office of Secretary of State, the Clinton Foundation and Bill Clinton received millions of dollars in paid speaking fees and a million dollar  gift from countries involved in matters with the State Department, many of which had ties to terrorism and human rights abuses; some of these funds were apparently diverted from charitable causes to personal expenses, such as Chelsea Clinton s 2010 wedding.Russian Uranium Deal (2009-2013): Hillary Clinton s State Department approved a deal allowing a Russian company to control 20% of the uranium mining production capacity inside the United States, which was followed by millions of dollars in donations to the Clinton Foundation from people associated with the transaction. This past week information was reported that prior to the Obama administration approving the very controversial deal in 2010 giving Russia 20% of America s Uranium through the approved sale of Uranium One, the FBI had evidence that Russian nuclear industry officials were involved in bribery, kickbacks, extortion and money laundering in order to benefit Vladimir Putin, says a report by The Hill. Mueller was the head of the FBI at this time! He was even hand picked by Hillary Clinton to hand over uranium to Russia on an airport tarmac at this time.Clinton Private Email Server (2009-2013): during her entire tenure as Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton dodged Freedom of Information Act requirements by using a private email server to conduct official government business, as well as sent and received classified information that was Top Secret over an unsecured system an  extremely reckless  (and obviously illegal) act. Mueller s acceptance of the lead role in the investigation into Russia is another obvious example of his corrupt and criminal tendencies. Based on numerous accounts he has obvious conflicts of interest and even liberal publications like the USA Today have called for Mueller to step down as special prosecutor because of his conflicts of interest with the investigation he is carrying on. Now we know he took over the investigation in spite of his criminal activities in covering up the FBI investigation into Uranium One. A person of integrity would easily have seen his conflicts of interest and would recuse himself.Independent UK   Donald Trump s former campaign Paul Manafort has said he has not been informed of any possible criminal charges against him, after it was reported the first indictments had been filed by the team investigating Russia s alleged meddling in the 2016 election.Reports said a grand jury working with Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, had approved the first charges to result from the ongoing probe that is looking at possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. The reports, which have not specified what the charges are or who they were filed against, said a suspect could be taken into custody as soon as Monday.CNN, which broke the news, said the charges were filed on Friday and placed under a seal by a federal judge. Yet, that has not stopped a flurry of speculation as to who may be the focus of Mr Mueller s charges and the nature of them. ",left-news,"Oct 29, 2017"
2919, WATCH: Bill Maher Returns And Hilariously Mocks Drug Addicted Red States For Voting Trump,"Bill Maher returned from break just in time for Donald Trump s inauguration and dedicated one of his  New Rules  to the red states that have massive drug addiction problems.Maher began by telling liberals that they need to stop calling Trump supporters  rubes and simpletons,  and  feel their pain  instead.Maher even proved that Trump supporters are truly in pain because he pointed out that of the 14 states that have the highest number of painkiller prescriptions in the country, all of them voted for Trump.Trump also won 80 percent of the states that have the biggest heroin problem, including the counties Trump won in Ohio and Pennsylvania. In other words, people voted for Trump because they were on drugs and out of their f*cking minds. So lets stop calling Trump supporters idiots and fools and call them what they are: f*cking drug addicts!  Maher said.Maher then proceeded to blast conservatives for being hypocrites because they ve been labeling liberals as drug addicts for decades but they are now the ones plagued by heroin and painkillers to the point where these states literally are flipping to Republicans.Maher noted that Trump s best state was West Virginia, where people pop over 400 painkillers per person. West Virginia s mascot is a dilated pupil,  Maher quipped. Maher also pointed out that Wisconsin has been turning redder and redder since 2008 and now has a major heroin epidemic that has caused the number of drug deaths to quadruple. I never thought I would hear myself say this, but kids, don t do heroin. It s a gateway to being a Republican,  Maher continued.Maher continued by trying to teach conservatives how to deal with being high without doing crazy shit like voting for Trump.  We get high and bid a thousand bucks for a Beatles lunchbox on eBay, you got high and ordered a president from Moscow. He then concluded the segment by telling drug addled conservative to  ignore the asshole across the bar who keeps staring at you staring at you, that s a mirror.

The Enquirer is placed by Publix between other tabloids that do not have censor shields blocking their covers.Trump s name and photo was featured on the front page of the Enquirer on issues dated November 28, December 5, 12, 19, 26 in 2016 and the most recent issue dated January 2, 2017 that featured the Trump family on the cover.

761, ICE Agent Spills: We’re Targeting Children For Detention ‘Because We Can’,"Trumpers are rejoicing over the escalating activities of Immigration and Customs Enforcement because of their wholly misguided belief that undocumented immigrants do nothing but sit here, in the U.S., illegally soaking up every dollar that should go to actual Americans. That mentality has spawned five squillion allegations about the behavior of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which has gotten increasingly brazen, and even abusive, since Trump s election.One ICE agent has apparently had enough, and he s speaking out. Jonathan Blitzer, a contributing writer to The New Yorker, got in touch with this agent (who would only allow these details to be published under condition of anonymity) who finds himself increasingly alarmed by the culture shift at the agency.He s particularly angry about ICE s specific targeting of children who entered the country as unaccompanied minors years ago. Those children were placed with families and allowed to attend school here, hopefully so they could make themselves into contributing members of society. He told Blitzer something shocking: That they re going after these children literally because they can, even though there s no real policy for what to do with them after they re rounded up. The plan is to take them back into custody, and then figure it out. I don t understand it. We re doing it because we can, and it bothers the hell out of me.The whole idea is targeting kids. I know that technically they meet the legal definition of being adults. Fine. But if they were my kids travelling in a foreign country, I wouldn t be O.K. with this. We re not doing what we tell people we do. If you look [at] next month, or at the end of this month, at the people in custody, it s people who ve been here for years. They re supposed to be in high school. This isn t some rookie who s only been with the agency for a few months or a year, and probably hasn t fully assimilated into the culture and become a cold-hearted, contemptuous, power-drunk officer. This is veteran officer who has been in federal immigration enforcement since the Clinton administration.He talks about what things were like before Trump: ICE used to look at the full circumstances of a deportation case before making decisions. He feels that the job of the agency is not to judge the people they re detaining, and yet, many ICE agents are doing just that now, and that s part of the problem. Their contempt is growing by leaps and bounds and it s affecting how the agency runs as a whole (which Trump fans no doubt love).While this particular agent was heavily critical of Obama and what he saw as micromanaging from Obama s administration, there s so much now that s gone that it s really no wonder individual agents seem hungry to arrest and remove as many people as possible   even if those people are children. It sounds like they re becoming single-minded about it.And this agent is also upset about the use of resources. Our immigration system is already badly clogged, and has been for a long time. ICE is pretty much intentionally making that worse. We still have to make decisions based on a responsible use of the government s resources you can t lock everybody up, We re putting more people into that overburdened system just because we can. There s just this school of thought that, well, we can do what we want. This is Trump s America. This is what the Trumpers want   they want  the other  gone and they don t care how it happens or who that  other  is, let alone what it s going to cost us. The fact that ICE is targeting children who were specifically placed with families here, and who should be attending high school now, is just flat-out vile. This is not America.Featured image via John Moore/Getty Images",News,"July 24, 2017"
18328,WHOA! NEW EVIDENCE SHOWS Supreme Court Chief Justice Roberts Was “Hacked” By Obama Regime In Same Surveillance Program That Spied On Private Citizen Donald Trump,"Meanwhile, in virtually every media outlet across America, Trump Trump Trump and Russia Russia Russia!Evidence shows that John Roberts, chief justice of the United States Supreme Court, was  hacked  by a Deep State surveillance operation overseen by Obama administration CIA director John Brennan and Obama director of national intelligence James Clapper.Roberts, the Bush appointee who made the decisive vote to uphold the constitutionality of Obamacare before the 2012 election, was allegedly the victim of the same Deep State surveillance program that spied on President Donald Trump.Tapes released by Federal Judge G. Murray Snow   preserved on a Whistleblower Soundcloud page   show real estate billionaire Timothy Blixseth explaining Brennan and Clapper s surveillance program to Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio and detective Mike Zullo. The existence of this surveillance program has been corroborated by Wikileaks   Vault 7  release and by the public comments of former CIA and NSA contractor Dennis Montgomery, who says he worked on the program for Brennan and Clapper.Montgomery has gone public with his claims exposing how the program was used to spy on President Donald Trump when he was a private citizen. Montgomery has gained immunity and desperately wants House Intelligence Chairman Rep. Devin Nunes or other lawmakers to call him to testify about what he knows.On the explosive tapes, Blixseth walks Arpaio and Zullo through the details of the program on a computer screen. At one point, the three begin pulling up specific names of targeted individuals.LISTEN TO TAPES (at the 18 minute mark HERE) You know who that guy is? That s the head of the FISA court they hacked into, Reggie Walton,  Blixseth tells the investigators. John Roberts, the chief justice of the Supreme Court, was hacked,  Blixseth tells Arpaio and Zullo.Insiders have always been skeptical of Roberts  motives for siding with President Obama on the 2012 Obamacare case. While there s still no available evidence that Roberts was blackmailed, the allegation that he was  hacked  by Obama officials provides some more context into the justice s controversial career.As Big League Politics reported, former FBI director James Comey seized and buried volumes of information that demonstrated this wide-ranging government surveillance operation targeting Donald Trump before he became president.For entire story: Big League Politics",left-news,"Jul 12, 2017"

15909,JUST IN: Anti-Putin Banker Claims Firm Tied To Clinton Campaign Assisted Russians In Effort ‘To Have Me Imprisoned And Killed’,"One of the many targets of the opposition research firm Fusion GPS is accusing them of assisting the Kremlin in its effort to have him  imprisoned and killed. The strong allegation comes from Bill Browder, a London-based banker who spearheaded the Magnitsky Act, a sanctions law vehemently opposed by the Russian government.Browder made the allegation in response to the recent revelation that Fusion GPS and its founder Glenn Simpson compiled what he says is false information about him that was given to Yuri Chaika, Russia s prosecutor general, and to Donald Trump Jr. during the infamous June 2016 Trump Tower meeting. If it is true that Glenn Simpson was supplying information about me to the Russian government, it s far more serious than smear campaigning or Foreign Agents Registration Act violations,  said Browder, the head of Hermitage Capital. It would mean that Simpson was assisting the Putin regime in their plot to get me back to Russia to have me imprisoned and killed.It was previously known that the Washington, D.C-based Fusion GPS s investigation of Browder was beneficial to the Russian government and its effort to reverse the Magnitsky Act. But it was revealed only last week that information Fusion collected on Browder was shared directly with Chaika, whose position is the Russian equivalent of the U.S. attorney general.Natalia Veselnitskaya, the Russian attorney who attended the Trump Tower meeting, is who provided both Chaika and Trump Jr. with the Fusion-generated information on Browder. She took a four-page report into the June 9, 2016 Trump Tower meeting, which was attended by Jared Kushner and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort.Veselnitskaya worked with Simpson, a former Wall Street Journal reporter, on the anti-Browder project. Reuters reported on Thursday that Simpson compiled the research for the Trump Tower memo. And NBC News reported on Friday that similar research put together by Simpson was given by Veselnitskaya to Chaika in Oct. 2015.Browder, who was born in Chicago but is a British citizen, is a target of the Kremlin s ire because of his role in pushing through the Magnitsky Act, which passed Congress in 2012. The Russian government recently issued an Interpol arrest in an attempt to apprehend Browder. Vladimir Putin reportedly approved the move against the 53-year-old money manager, who wrote a book about his travails called  Red Notice,  a reference to the term used for Interpol warrants.Fusion GPS, which is based in Washington, D.C., became involved in the Browder matter after being hired by BakerHostetler, a law firm representing Denis Katsyv, a Russian businessman who faced penalties because of the Magnitsky Act.Simpson worked closely on the investigation with the Moscow-based Veselnitskaya, who represents Katsyv and his firm, Prevezon Holdings.Veselnitskaya s affiliation with Simpson is one of the stranger story lines arising from both the Trump Tower meeting and the dossier, which was funded by the Clinton campaign and DNC.Theories have circulated that Fusion GPS arranged the Trump Tower meeting in order to compromise the Trump campaign or that Simpson relayed details of the meeting provided by Veselnitskaya to Christopher Steele, the former British spy who wrote the dossier.Fusion was being paid for its dossier work at the same time it was being paid by BakerHostetler to investigate Browder.Adding even more fuel to those theories was a report this week that Simpson and Veselnitskaya met just before and just after she attended the Trump Tower session:BUSTED! MEETING BETWEEN FUSION GPS AND RUSSIAN LAWYER BEFORE AND AFTER:The co-founder of Fusion GPS, the firm behind the unverified Trump dossier, met with a Russian lawyer before and after a key meeting she had last year with Trump Jr. The contacts shed new light on how closely tied the firm was to Russian interests, at a time when it was financing research to discredit then-candidate Donald Trump.The opposition research firm has faced renewed scrutiny after litigation revealed that the DNC and Hillary Clinton s campaign paid for that research. Congressional Republicans have since questioned whether that politically financed research contributed to the FBI s investigation of Russian collusion with the Trump campaign   making Fusion s 2016 contacts with Russian interests all the more relevant.DNC MONEY FUNNELED THROUGH LAW FIRM TO FUSION GPS?The June 2016 Trump Tower meeting involving Donald Trump Jr. and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya occurred during a critical period. Bank records show Fusion GPS was paid by a law firm for work on behalf of a Kremlin-linked oligarch while paying a former British spy Christopher Steele to dig up dirt on Trump through his Russian contacts.But hours before the Trump Tower meeting on June 9, 2016, Fusion co-founder and ex-Wall Street Journal reporter Glenn Simpson was with Veselnitskaya in a Manhattan federal courtroom. Court records show email correspondence and published reports corroborate the pair s presence together. They also were together after the Trump Tower meeting.Read more: Fox NewsRead more: Daily Caller",Government News,"Nov 13, 2017"
20363,IRON FISTED SOCIAL ENGINEERING: D.C. Threatens Fines For Anyone Who Improperly Addresses Transgenders,"Following a leftist agenda is no longer optional. Follow their rules or be subject to fines The guide states,  The District uses the probable cause standard in determining whether the above constitute harassment or a hostile work environment. Stephanie Franklin, OHR s interim director of policy and communications, confirmed in an email that  Any workplace environment in DC private businesses included  in which supervisors or co-workers deliberately misuse a person s preferred name or pronoun may be considered unlawful harassment and/or a hostile work environment according to DC law. The  best practices  guide featues a chart on  gender and gender-neutral pronouns  that includes the gender-neutral pronoun  ze.  The chart includes example phrases using the gender-neutral pronoun, such as  Ze smiled,   I met zir,   Zir bike  and  Ze is zirself. Regardless of the legal name and gender, employers should use an employee s desired name and pronouns when communicating with them, and when talking about them to third parties,  the guide states.The guide says,  The employer must ensure employees respect and use a transgender employee s preferred names and pronouns, as repeated failure to do so can be considered harassment, and can cause severe distress to a transgender employee. The guide also make clear that employees should be allowed to use the bathroom in which they re most comfortable . Transgender employees should at all times be able to use the restroom and other gender-segregated facilities (such as locker rooms) that they are most comfortable with,  the guide states.In the 2015 fiscal year, 307 discrimination complaints (including race, gender and disability complaints) ended in settlements via the mediation process. In 2015, the annual report states,  more than $3.69 million was awarded in settlements during successful mediations, a 74 percent increase over [the 2014 fiscal year].  That averages out to more than $12,000 per settlement. According to non-profit organization Workplace Fairness, D.C. s anti-discrimination protections are  broader than federal law because you may prove your case by showing that your employer acted wholly or partially for discriminatory reasons, and because you can bring an individual claim against your supervisor for  aiding and abetting  discrimination.

22513,‘STRANGER THINGS’ – Hollywood MK Ultra Goes Full Occult,"Jay Dyer 21st Century WireThe popular 80s pastiche series Stranger Things begins with a familiar scene of E.T. nostalgia, centering around Dungeons & Dragons. The scene is particularly familiar to me, since I played D&D back in the day, but learned very quickly this nefarious practice was like kryptonite to all things female.  Oddly enough, the series appears to reflect a new trend amongst Hollywood A-listers, where nerd culture has revived the ancient 80s practice of playing D&D.  The Hollywood Reporter explains the trend and its connection to acting and role-playing: Vin Diesel plays it. So do Dwayne Johnson, Drew Barrymore, Stephen Colbert, Mike Myers and Jon Favreau, among other bold-face names. Some even built their careers by playing it The decades-old role-playing game   in which participants roll multisided dice while pretending to be mystical creatures such as elves and dwarves   finally is coming out of the closet (or, in this case, Mom s basement).  There s a huge resurgence of nerd culture, especially with the tech boom,  says Silicon Valley s Martin Starr, a longtime D&D enthusiast.  If nerds were still poor and living at their mothers , nobody would be paying any attention to Dungeons & Dragons. But nerds rule the world, and D&D is making a big comeback   and I m excited about it. While this certainly relates to a furtherance of one s improv skills, it also relates to the occult side of Hollywood, though I don t take the ridiculous evangelical view that D&D is inherently evil.  Rather, the notion of role-playing is synonymous with the ancient view of acting as dramaturgy, or ritual invocation of the gods.  Comparative religion scholar Dudley Young writes: The earliest gods were invoked by ritual act (dromenon = the thing done) such as a sacrificial dance, commemorating the fact that our life begins and ends when they call upon us.  Subsequently the thing was said (legomenon) as well as done, and the dromenon was on its way to becoming the drama.  Once speech within the temple precincts has been endowed with the power of word-magic, we have  the invocation  properly so called.  (Dudley Young, Origins of the Sacred: The Ecstasies of Love and War, pg. 413)Set in the fictional small town of Hawkins, Indiana in 1983, we will see the accidental dramaturgical invocation where the D&D simulacrum appears to actually be related on a deeper level to the occult phenomena that begin to occur.  The disappearance of young Will Byers sparks a series of events that take Hawkins down a black rabbit hole of every conspiracy theory ever, melded with the opening of the inter-dimensional gates from every John Carpenter film. Originally slated to be titled  Montauk,  the series echoes the dubious accounts of Project Montauk, where purportedly time and space were altered in government-sponsored PsyOps and time travel  experiments with famed UFO researcher Jacques Vallee commenting the experiments were related to the Philadelphia Experiment.  For more information and speculation on this topic, I interviewed Dr. Farrell on his views here.D & D invokes the entities in E.T.. The stories of Montauk appear to originate in a book series by Preston Nichols, who claims to have discovered  repressed memories  of the event.  This laughable scenario immediately smacks of PsyOps, making the original connection to large-scale deception all the more appropriate.  Even Vallee alleges the  experiment is a hoax, suggesting an experiment in seeing what you can get people to believe, as opposed to some real space-time warping experiment. Vallee writes: I hypothesized that the experiments had to do with a radar countermeasures test. Indeed a Raytheon advertisement published thirteen years ago suggested that the corresponding technology was now out in the open (Raytheon, 1980). This hypothesis, however, failed to explain a few of the facts that highlighted the story. In particular it did not account for the observed disappearance of the destroyer from the harbor, for the mysterious devices brought on board under extreme security precautions, or for the alleged disappearance of two sailors from a nearby tavern. While it may be the case that the Navy altered space-time, does Vallee not consider the possibility this is all bullshit, as so many  military whistleblowers  and  generals  so often  leak ?  Rather, as is so often the case, all the  evidence  for these events relies on some retired Navy man with all the credentials of the Navy man from the Village People. This is also why the Montauk tale mixes aliens and other nonsense in with the notion of the Apollo Mission being staged   disinformation.  Vallee himself was a high up government operator with an interest in occultism and Rosicrucianism, and is represented in Spielberg s Close Encounters by the character of Claude Lacombe (played by Francois Truffaut).Through the dimensional gate: the Demogorgon saps energy and hatches incubus style demon-babies in Ridley Scott form. .Thus, all of this functions as the spirit behind Stranger Things, as well as myriad other influences, such as Star Wars, Alien, Goonies, H.P. Lovecraft, Evil Dead, X-Men, Stephen King, and John Carpenter.  That said, I consider the series as accurately showing some aspects of the spiritual realm, couched in scientistic mysticism, where our initial suspicion of extra-terrestrial alien manipulation is revealed to be both terrestrial and demonic.  The Demogorgon inhabits a realm that is the  upside down,  the negative or demonic dark side of our world, which matches up to the Kabbalistic notion of the Qilphoth or the Abyss of Da at at times, as Crowley claims: This doctrine is extremely difficult to explain; but it corresponds more or less to the gap in thought between the Real, which is ideal, and the Unreal, which is actual. In the Abyss all things exist, indeed, at least in posse, but are without any possible meaning; for they lack the substratum of spiritual Reality. They are appearances without Law. They are thus Insane Delusions  Now the Abyss being thus the great storehouse of Phenomena, it is the source of all impressions. Spoiler alert, but the missing children are not only part of MK Ultra, but are being used in top-secret testing that includes LSD, sensory deprivation and the development of Men Who Stare at Goats (or Kids Who Stare at Kittens)-type mental powers.  Interestingly, the abducted super-soldier kid named  11  and  El  is specifically told to kill a kitten which is rumored to be an aspect of trauma-based mind control.  Basically, all the rumors of hardcore child abuse and mind control are rolled into the series with the character  El,  who is able to remote view the spiritual realm and spy on Soviets (as well as Demogorgons).Like the simulacrum in Spielberg films, the spirits communicate across the void through the Kabbalistic principle of esoteric symbology and linguistics, as I showed in my Close Encounters analysis.. Oblivious to the dangers of such programs, Mr. Man in Black Shadow Government from the Dept. of Energy persists in hunting down his escaped  daughter  El (hinting at sexual abuse), who finds her way into the Goonies gang of Mike, Will and Lucas (I m assuming you ve seen it).  Most interesting is the biblical and occult notion of the opening of  gates  through such  scientific  experiments, which are in fact occult rituals involving child adduction and sacrifice under the guise of  cancer  research (MK Ultra).  Could this be a hint at what the cancer complex is really involved in?  Genetic and psychological experimentation with children for the  greater good ?  Certainly there have been numerous cases of missing children in the US, as well as small towns experimented on by the shadow government.  It would seem that Stanger Things is obliquely referencing these themes, as well as the possibility of actual murders and abductions, as author William Ramsey argues here.Given blood and sacrifice bring the demon and open the gate, we can assume the references are to the goetia, where demons are invoked through sigils. . Two notions that occurred to me I have not seen tacked yet in the series is the strange reference to the loss of  father  and  God,  as we see no strong male figures.  Hop the cop, like a horny rabbit, hops from girl to girl having lost his daughter, while Will s father is a deadbeat.  In Mike and Nancy s household, the ineffectual, sterile father character of Mr. Wheeler remains ever clueless while arguing to Mrs. Wheeler the  government is on our side,  and would never lie.Set in the Cold War, the fear and panic of the ridiculous  Russian Threat  in the background of the series allows the shadow state to develop the explicitly-named Star Wars Defense Program, where  lasers and space weapons  are being made to destroy the  Russkies.  Amazingly accurate in this insight, this is a point JaysAnalysis has been highlighting the last few years with the hype of the Cold War deception allowing for the rise of the dark military industrial complex which seems to have a penchant for human sacrifice.  Note that I have argued many times that Mk Ultra was not merely a mind control experiment, but was about the entire biosphere, under the Department of Energy.Cop Hop discovers the advanced weapons lab facility is involved in MK Ultra   something I have discussed many times. . The sacrifice of the youth for the dark designs of the shadow government is the ultimate conspiracy in the series, but what is more remarkable than this is the explanation by the Man in Black Dr. Brenner (Matthew Modine) that the sacrifice of sons and daughters for the gorgodemon is for the good of America.  In other words, we are given the impression our villain knows the real source of the dark power in Hawkins, the demonic, and that the sacrifice of humans and blood draws it nearer and nearer.  Foolishly assuming this dark energy can be harnessed for U.S. supremacy, Dr. Brenner is behind both MK Ultra and the SDI program that requires the sacrifice of America s  sons and daughters !  This spiritual dimension is the accurate and insightful aspect of the series, but the message is not all good.Dr. Brenner demands more demonic channeling from El. Note her similarity of appearance to the Princess in The Never Ending Story..  The flip side, as mentioned, is that El as an androgynous, yet dominantly feminine archetype, is a form of the incarnation of the goddess.  We have seen this of late in pop fiction more times than I can count, in examples like Hanna, Hunger Games, Lucy, Ex Machina and Jupiter Ascending, where the gnostic perspective of exalting the opposing force to the male is assumed to bring a cosmically needed  balance to the war hawk patriarchy.  A perennial myth of liberal fantasies, the feminist archetype will in no way bring peace and balance, only more destruction as gender roles continue to be confused.  Feminism is part of that very destruction, and the fact that El shouts out in the aether  God,   Dad  and  Gone,  suggests her association with Dr. Brenner as her  dad  and Father God s lack of answer to her call, means the solution to the spiritual problems of man can be found in a Luciferian evolution of humans beyond the  traps  of gender and evil patriarchal deities.  In occultist Edmund Spenser s Faerie Queen, we read:Downe in the bottome of the deepe Abysse Where Demogorgon in dull darknesse pent, Farre from the view of Gods and heauens blis, The hideous Chaos keepes, their dreadfull dwelling is.   (Book IV, Canto ii, stanza 47)In the process of becoming cruciform, the sacred feminine pistis Sophia incarnate destroys the patriarchal  non-God. .  Indeed, El annihilates the cruciform Demogorgon as if it were a demiurge that has imprisoned the town spiritually.  This is precisely the Luciferian view   Jesus and/or God the Father are demiurges who have imprisoned humans in this dimension and sap their energy as vampires, requiring blood sacrifice.  Of course, none of that is true, as the Logos is the salvation of the human race, reconciling them to God by becoming Incarnate and destroying Death.  In the gnostic scheme the roles are reversed, where El becomes the Luciferian dark hero rescuing the town through her sacrifice to destroy the cruciform demon-god.  And, as you probably guessed, that is why her name is  El,  recalling the old Canaanite term for the gods who warred against Jehovah in the Bible.  In fact, the Demogorgon is generally traced back to the demiurge.The series also uses numerology frequently, such as  11  and  77  suggesting the demonology of Crowley and references to 9/11 as a ritual initiation.  Interestingly, light is mentioned several times in the series as both a means of communication and symbol of enlightenment.  As you can see in the above image,  photosynthesis  is placed behind El as she dissolves the Demogorgon, suggesting the dissolution of Traditional Religion by  enlightenment,  perfectly consonant with the message of Gnosticism and Luciferianism.The gateways have been opened through mass human sacrifice of America s sons and daughters   the  new man  is a dark, half-androgynous goddess who will destroy the  genocidal  patriarchal religions and bring a new Amerikan aeon of the crowned and conquering girl-child, a Luciferian world order.READ MORE HOLLYWOOD NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Hollywood FilesTo hear Jay s full podcasts, see more information and learn how you can become a subscriber to JaysAnalysis.Jay Dyer is the author of the forthcoming title, Esoteric Hollywood: Sex, Cults and Symbols in Film from Trine Day.

3550, Joe Biden Makes BIG News About 2020 Election,"The results of the disappointing 2016 presidential election aren t even official yet, but Vice President Joe Biden is already making noise about 2020. Known for bucking the rules and speaking from his gut, the outgoing vice-president hinted that he might be up for another fight four years from now.CNN asked him jokingly if he planned to run for office again. Yeah, I am. I m going to run in 2020,  Biden responded.When asked for what position, Biden responded,  For president. What the hell, man. When CNN told Biden it was planning to publish his quotes, the vice president responded,  That s okay. No, I ve enjoyed every minutes of my time here in the Senate. It s a great feeling to come back. I love this place. Biden later clarified,  I m not committing not to run. I m not committing to anything. I learned a long time ago fate has a strange way of intervening. Biden is leaving office one of the most popular political figures in America, and that popularity is even higher among Democrats. Biden is seen by many as a Democrat who excels at speaking to working class families across the racial spectrum, but still has a history of legislative experience as success as a Senator from Delaware and then as a two-term Vice President.Biden would likely be able to tap into existing Democratic donors if he ran, as he has near 100% name recognition domestically and internationally. Besides First Lady Michelle Obama, he would probably be the public figure to benefit most from an association with President Obama.Biden considered running in the 2016 election, but decided against it after the tragic death of his son Beau Biden. Since then, President Obama has put Biden in charge of the  moon shot  effort to find a cure for cancer, while Biden endorsed and heavily campaigned for Secretary Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election.Featured image via Flickr",News,"December 5, 2016"
8384, Ben Carson Has A Very Public Meltdown After Getting Trashed In Iowa (VIDEO),"It hasn t been a very good time for Ben Carson s campaign to become America s first Black Republican President. But his very public meltdown after getting trashed in Iowa might suggest that he has no place anywhere near the red button anyway.Carson crashed badly in Iowa, picking up just 9% of the vote, leaving him in fourth place behind Ted Cruz (28%), Donald Trump (24%) and Marco Rubio (23%). His explanation? According to Carson, it s all a big conspiracy to keep him out of the race for President. He told supporters in a speech which felt rather more like a public nervous breakdown: I was reasonably happy today until I discovered the dirty tricks that were going on. And people spreading rumors that I had dropped out and that people should caucus for somebody else,  he continued.  I mean, do you think that that is something that s acceptable? Apparently, Carson is arguing that people didn t vote for him because Ted Cruz told them not to.The candidate insisted his campaign was not over, and yet boarded an early flight home to Florida for  rest    meanwhile, the other candidates headed straight to New Hampshire or South Carolina to battle the next stage of the Primaries.So while his opponents were off developing their strategy for the next battleground states, Carson decided to write an email to his supporters, and continue his meltdown in public. For months, my campaign has survived the lies and dirty tricks from opponents who profess to to detest the games of the political class, but in reality are masters at it,  he wrote. Even tonight, my opponents resorted to political tricks by tweeting, texting and telling precinct captains to announce that I had suspended my campaign   in some cases asking caucus goers to change their votes. What is considerably more certain than this conspiracy theory, is that Mr. Carson will be making that exiting from the race announcement soon. Hopefully with a little more grace than he could muster in Iowa.  Featured Image via screen capture",News,"February 2, 2016"

I hereby direct that to secure our border, China shall immediately and without hesitation send us their wall. Done. Boom!  Stewart began.It makes sense, too, since Trump has repeatedly antagonized China over the last few months to the point where a confrontation could occur between China and the United States in the near future if Trump continues to to try to bully them.Stewart then declared that America has a new national language. The new official language of the United States is bullshit,  he said.  I, Donald J. Trump, have instructed my staff to speak only in bullshit. Stewart went on to declare that the staff must only speak bullshit at work and at home. None of those pesky facts are acceptable at any time.Then Stewart revealed the third executive order Trump will sign. I Donald J. Trump am exhausting. It has been eleven days, Stephen. Eleven f*cking days. Eleven! The presidency is supposed to age the president, not the public. The reason that I, Donald J. Trump, am exhausting is that every instinct and fiber of my pathological self regard calls me to abuse of power.Stewart then mocked Trump s request to have tanks at his parade and his whining because he isn t adored by the whole nation.Stewart compared Trump to Emperor Palpatine from Star Wars and said that the American people are going to have a hell of a fight trying to prevent him from destroying democracy.

He sang that song so many times but never felt ok singing it? That s the difference between Springsteen and someone like Lee Greenwood. Lee Greenwood has always been a passionate and fearless supporter of America and the American way. Springsteen is just a phony Speaking at a Q&A session with Tom Hanks at the Tribeca Film Festival, the 67-year-old rocker opened up to the Oscar-winning actor, insisting that it was E Street Band guitarist Stevie Van Zandt who convinced him to keep the 1984 hit.Springsteen s memorable tune was written in part tribute to friends who had served in the American Army during the Vietnam War and the ironic treatment of the veterans upon their return home. He divulged:  Stevie [Van Zandt, longtime guitarist in the E Street Band] convinced me to keep that song. I remember at the time thinking it s too glib. It s too glib. I think I still think that. But Stevie said,  No, no, no   it s about the band, the brotherhood of the band, the fans. The New Jersey native   who has been married to Patti Scialfa since 1991   added that he gave his musical peer the  benefit of the doubt  but still doesn t feel quite comfortable with the song.Adding:  I gave him the benefit of the doubt. We ve played it an awful lot ever since. But I was always a little frightened of it. And the whole record I always have mixed feelings about.  Despite his feelings, the epochal song has received much praise throughout the years and was ranked 275th on Rolling Stone s list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time as well as placed on RIAA s Songs of the Century.The fan favorite and title track of his 1984 album of the same name inspired famed photographer Annie Leibovitz s iconic photo of Springsteen s backside against the backdrop of an American flag for the record cover. Commenting on the concept in 1984, the Medal of Freedom recipient told Rolling Stone:  We had the flag on the cover because the first song was called  Born in the U.S.A. , and the theme of the record kind of follows from the themes I ve been writing about for at least the last six or seven years.Read more: Daily MailSPRINGSTEEN JUST RELEASED A SONG THAT BASHES PRESIDENT TRUMP Bruce Springsteen aka  The Boss  is showing all of his fans just how out of touch he is with his latest song. He s been a fervent anti-Trump guy and has been very outspoken against President Donald Trump. His new protest song refers to Trump as a  con man . What a way to disrespect the leader of our nation! has Bruce Springsteen employed thousands of Americans? It s interesting that Trump just delivered one of the best ever speeches to the builders union. Please watch the video provided below of what a real working man does for his crew. It s an awesome speech that totally discounts everything Springsteen is trying to say to bash Trump. Shame on him!The 67-year-old rocker released his and Joe Grushecky s anti-Trump song, called  That s What Makes Us Great,  and it is a direct comment on the president and his administration, according to Pitchfork.Springsteen s part of the song goes as follows: Don t tell me a lieAnd sell it as a factI ve been down that road beforeAnd I ain t going back.And don t you brag to meThat you never read a bookI never put my faithIn a con man and his crooks.  During an interview with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Gushecky talked about writing the song in January after Trump was sworn-in as president I had this song, and Bruce and I had been talking,  Grushecky said.  I sent it to him and he liked it. I said,  What do you think about singing on it?  He gave it the Bruce treatment. In February, Springsteen said he was an  embarrassed  American during a concert in Australia. On the same tour he attacked Trump s first travel ban as  un-American. Tonight we want to add our voice to the thousands of Americans who are protesting at airports around our country the Muslim ban and the detention of foreign nationals and refugees,  Springsteen told the crowd.  America is a nation of immigrants. This is fundamentally un-American. What a bunch of bull! Springsteen has lost his roots and his sense of the working man. If he cared to know anything about President Trump then he would know Trump s bringing back American jobs. He s working hard to get the steel industry up and running again. He just held a  Buy American, Hire American  event promoting keeping jobs in America. What s better than a president who s a builder speaking to builders and construction workers. In President Trump s speech he calls out people by name pretty great! He knows business and building. We re in good hands America! The era of economic surrender has come to an end. It s come to an end. We have surrendered as a country to outside interests. The era of economic victory for our country has just begun. You will see..

2295, Pence Does His Best Trump Impression; DEMANDS Apology From AP Over Email Story (DETAILS),"Donald Trump s number two man, Mike Pence, has largely been seen as the antithesis to Trump s erratic, bombastic, authoritarian style of governing. However, Pence is crazy in his own way. He s a theocrat who wants to usher in mandatory Evangelical Christianity and force it upon all Americans. What s really scary is that he is so quiet about it that most people don t know what kind of monster Pence really is until they do a bit of research and discover his horrifying beliefs. Well, all that may be changing, and we might have the Associated Press to thank for it.By now, everyone knows that it turns out that while he was Governor of Indiana, Pence used a private AOL email address to conduct sensitive government business   and the email was actually hacked. This is amazingly hypocritical, considering the fact that Republicans everywhere   including Trump and Pence, of course   hammered Hillary Clinton relentlessly, and even had their crowds screaming  LOCK HER UP!    all for doing the exact same thing that Pence has just been caught doing. The hypocrisy here defies description.The plot of the whole thing thickens, because it appears that the AP repeatedly asked for transcripts of Pence s secret emails that were not released to the public. As a result, in the story of Pence s email scandal, Pence s wife, Karen Pence, had her private email address published. This, of course, has Pence beside himself with rage. He is now trying to bully the AP into an apology, Trump-style.Mark Paoletta, Pence s White House counsel, sent the following directive to the AP: The publication of Mrs. Pence s active private email address to millions of your readers has subjected her to vitriolic and malicious emails and raised serious security concerns. There was absolutely no reason to publish this private email address and you should be ashamed of your reprehensible contact. Your organization should apologize to Mrs. Pence for violating her privacy, and the Associated Press should observe the basic tenets of fairness, decency and journalistic integrity and covering the Vice President, Mrs. Pence and their family in the future. Here is Pence s belligerent tweet, with the entire letter included:When we requested they take it down, they refused. The @AP owes my wife an apology. pic.twitter.com/LdMmnewnWF  Vice President Pence (@VP) March 4, 2017This is REALLY rich, considering that Trump tweeted out Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) s personal cell phone number during the campaign, all because Graham dared to criticize Trump. Pence really has no moral high ground regarding anything resembling decency, considering that he is in bed with The Donald, especially on these sorts of matters.As for the AP, they are being good, tough checks on these bullies, and have refused to remove Karen Pence s email address from the original. As a consolation, though, they did omit the address from further writings on the subject of the Pence email situation, according to spokeswoman Laura Easton, who says,  AP removed the email address from subsequent stories after learning Mrs. Pence still used the account. This is all Pence s fault, anyway, because according to the AP, the story only ran because Pence: repeatedly stonewalled media requests to view public records when he was Indiana s governor, including emails about state business distributed from a private AOL account that was hacked last year. This is really getting ridiculous, these threats to the press every time a story this incompetent, chaotic administration doesn t like drops. They are corrupt, vindictive, malicious, and likely engaged in criminal activity.Keep the pressure on, journalists.

1107, School Employee Calls For Killing LGBTQ People At Pride Festival (VIDEO),"An employee of the Columbus City School system made a post to Facebook on Thursday, where they called for a  Boston Marathon like  attack at a local Columbus City LGBTQ pride festival. The poster wrote on the event s official page: I hope this event turns out like the Boston Marathon a few year s (sic) back. All [LGBTQ people] should be killed or at least relocated. Both the local police and Homeland have been made aware of the threat and are looking into the matter.A local NBC affiliate contacted the individual who made the post and questioned his motivations. The individual refused to say why he posted the hateful message and responded that they did not have anything to say about the matter. The school district quickly responded to the news by issuing a statement where they called the comments  inappropriate.  The school district released a statement the next day where they announced that the poster was being terminated from his position.    I can share that the District is working toward his termination. More importantly, we are gearing up for an even larger contingent of teachers, staff, students, families[,] and allies planning to march together at tomorrow s Pride Parade. We are expecting well over 400 people   upward of 500 now as people positively respond to the immediate actions we took as a District following this employee s unacceptable actions,  the statement reads. Despite recent legal gains such as the SCOTUS decision that made marriage equality the law of the land, hate crimes that target LGBTQ individuals have been on the rise. In fact, 2016 was declared the deadliest year on record for LGBTQ people according to data that was compiled by analysts. The report also cited the recent political climate as a major contributing factor in the rise. When Republicans are in charge, the queer community also suffers heavily.

5682, Trump’s Creepy Obsession With Waterboarding Gets Renewed By Istanbul Suicide Bombings (TWEETS),"Trump responded to yesterday s tragic suicide bombings at Istanbul s Ataturk Airport the only way he knows how   by ramping up the fear mongering and rallying for more violence and torture. This of course, renewed his weird obsession with waterboarding and other more extreme torture practices.In speaked at a rally in St. Clairsville, Ohio, Trump made his case: We can t do waterboarding but they can do chopping off heads, drowning people in steel cages, they can do whatever they want to do. You know, you have to fight fire with fire. The suicide bombings at the airport killed at least 41 people, wounding over 230. Just the day before the attack happened, the State Dept. had issued a travel warning about the increased terror threat in Turkey. According to the Turkish government, Islamic State fighters were likely responsible. Trump continued to harp on everyone s anxiety: Folks, there s something going on that s really really bad. All right? It s bad. And we better get smart and we better get tough or we re not going to have much much a country left, okay? It s bad. Terrible. Trump then spoke specifically about waterboarding, a torture practice that was banned by the George W. Bush administration ten years ago. The crowd cheered when Trump said,  I like it a lot.  Implying that if he was elected President, torture methods would get much worse, Trump added,  I don t think it s tough enough. Trump also took to Twitter to drive his point home, encouraging the U.S. to do  everything  possible to stop terrorism.TwitterTwitterHe returned to waterboarding once again in an interview with CNN. In an appearance on  The Situation Room,  Trump said he d  change our law on, you know, the waterboarding thing  in order to  be able to fight at least on an almost equal basis. Nothing s nice about it but it s a minimal form of torture. We can t water board and they can chop off heads. Featured image via Ralph Freso / Getty Images",News,"June 29, 2016"
15013,THE FACE OF THE DEMOCRAT PARTY Has A Message For The Tea Party And You Won’t Want To Miss It…[VIDEO],"This ass-clown reminds us of why term limits are so important. Leisa and I saw Rep. Rangel (D-NY) up close and personal last week when we visited the Capitol building as guests of Rep. Mike Bishop (R-MI). We were shocked at some of the people who have been elected to represent our nation. 20% of the House members looked like they should be roaming the halls of a nursing home  NOT the halls of Congress!  These people have no business making serious decisions on behalf of our country. Charlie Rangel is a perfect example of our assertion It s no secret that Democrats can t stand the Tea Party, but rarely do they express their hatred out loud like Rep. Charlie Rangel did. In a moment caught on camera, the Democrat Congressman let reporters know what he really thinks about the coalition of citizens who believe in individual liberty and small government (some of whom are undoubtedly his own constituents).TheBlaze reports:Rep. Charlie Rangel (D-N.Y.) had harsh words for Tea Party Republicans during a town hall he hosted Tuesday in New York City. The outspoken Democrat was asked by TheBlaze about what he thinks motivates the more conservative wing of the House Republicans. They come from states that used to own slaves,  Rangel said of his Tea Party colleagues.  They come from states that the Confederate Army was pledged allegiance to. They come from states that the Ku Klux Klan and voters rights and all of those things came into play.

9581,HILARIOUS! Paul Joseph Watson DESTROYS Media For Bullsh*t Russian Collusion Propaganda [VIDEO],"Paul Joseph Watson nails it again. In the video below, Watson does a brilliant job of exposing the hypocrisy of the media and why they are not to be believed or trusted when it comes to offering actual news without a nauseating leftist bias.From Ned Ryan of Fox News  You may have heard of the scandal brewing in Washington. Presidential advisers cutting sweetheart deals with a foreign power, signing million dollar lobbying contracts with that foreign power, bribes being proffered, and the foreign government gained unprecedented access to government agencies and crucial U.S. natural resources? And what if I told you that foreign power was Russia?Collusion you say? Perhaps. Collusion with Trump? Nope.I m talking about a news story that fittingly is coming back from the dead just before Halloween to scare a lot of Democrats, Bill and Hillary Clinton and Obama administration officials. If you want to take a deeper dive on this issue, read the book  Clinton Cash,  by Peter Schweizer, president of the Government Accountability Institute. But here are the basics.A decade ago, a long-time Clinton Foundation donor, Frank Giustra, sold his uranium company to another firm, Uranium One. With that deal, Uranium One now owned uranium mines in the western U.S., including Wyoming, with about 20 percent of U.S. uranium production capacity, and about ten percent of the actual uranium mined in the U.S.In 2009, Rosatom, Russia s nuclear agency, took a 17-percent position in Uranium One. A year later, in the summer of 2010, Rosatom bought majority control of the Uranium One, effectively giving the Russian government-controlled entity proprietary access to one-fifth of the U.S. uranium supply.And then there s that whole phony Trump-Russian dossier story Watch, as Paul Joseph Watson DESTROYS the liberal media for force-feeding their viewers with  24/7 phony Trump-Russian coverage, without having so much as ONE actual identifiable or legitimate source to back up their assertions. But when ACTUAL evidence is put forth about REAL collusion with the Russians by Hillary Clinton and the DNC for the purposes of affecting the outcome of the election,  the media goes silent.Enjoy:",politics,"Oct 27, 2017"

2619, WATCH: Sean Spicer Spits On Coretta Scott King’s Grave In Defense Of Jeff Sessions,"Donald Trump s White House mouthpiece just desecrated an American civil rights icon to defend a racist.Back in 1986, Coretta Scott King wrote a letter in opposition to Ronald Reagan s nomination of Jeff Sessions to a federal judgeship. The widow of Martin Luther King Jr. condemned Sessions for his track record on voting rights and implored Republicans to reject him. They did.Mrs. King died in 2006 but her words against Sessions continue to haunt him to this day as he has been nominated by Trump to be Attorney General, which would give him the power to cripple civil rights and voting rights across this country.King wrote that Sessions  lacks the temperament, fairness, and judgement to be a federal judge  and has  used the awesome power of his office to chill the free exercise of the vote by black citizens. His attempt to prosecute three civil right activists who were helping black people vote in Alabama  raises serious questions about his commitment to the protections of the voting rights of all American citizens and consequently his fair and unbiased judgement regarding this fundamental right. Based on his record, I believe his confirmation would have a devastating effect on not only the judicial system in Alabama, but also on the progress we have made everywhere toward fulfilling my husband s dream that he envisioned over twenty years ago. Sean Spicer, however, seems to think that if King were alive today, she would just  come around  to supporting Sessions and would change her mind about him.During the daily press briefing, Spicer said  I would respectfully disagree with her assessment of Senator Sessions then and now. His record on civil voting rights, I think, is outstanding. I can only hope that if she were still with us today that after getting to know him that she would share the same view. Spicer went on to lie his ass off about Sessions, painting him as a civil rights hero when the fact is that Sessions is the man who didn t mind the KKK until he found out that they smoked pot. He didn t seem to give a damn about the history of lynching and racism the KKK is responsible for.Here s the video via Twitter.Ugh. Spicer desecrates Coretta Scott King, tells string of lies about Sessions pic.twitter.com/65nqBjIcFY  Tommy Christopher (@tommyxtopher) February 8, 2017There has been fierce opposition to Sessions ever since Trump nominated him. The KKK endorsed Trump and cheered his decision when he announced Sessions as his pick to head the Justice Department. Clearly, racists see Sessions as their chance to roll back critical civil and voting rights protections for minorities.If Coretta Scott King were alive today, it is unlikely she would join the KKK by endorsing Sessions. She would still oppose Jeff Sessions and so should every American who believes in liberty and justice for ALL. Because if Jeff Sessions is confirmed, he will take the justice out of the Justice Department and all the progress made by real civil rights heroes will be erased.Read more:Featured Image: Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"February 8, 2017"
20631,DETROIT PUBLIC SCHOOL Assistant Supervisor Admits To Stealing Money From Special Needs Students,"This is the same school district that is begging the State of Michigan residents to fund a $500 million debt they cannot pay back. If the state doesn t come to some sort of agreement to bail out the devastated, Democrat run city of Detroit schools yet again, by the June 30th deadline, they will run out of money and the schools could be forced to shut down. As usual with public schools run in poor cities run by Democrats, it s the kids who suffer at the hands of these self-serving criminals After 38 years of working for Detroit Public Schools, an assistant superintendent admitted in federal court today that she cheated kids with disabilities out of school supplies by helping a crooked vendor run a kickback scheme that could send her to prison for nearly six years.With her voice quivering, Clara Flowers, 61, of Detroit pleaded guilty to accepting $324,685 in kickbacks from a vendor as a thank-you for helping him bill DPS for school supplies that were intended for children with disabilities but were never delivered.Flowers, the assistant superintendent of Detroit Public Schools  Office of Specialized Student Services, offered no explanation or excuses for her actions. When asked to explain what she did, Flowers, in a shaky voice, said:  I received kickbacks from Norman Shy. Flowers said the kickbacks from Shy   who has also been charged in the case   came in the forms of checks, prepaid gift cards and home improvements on her private residence. Their scheme, she said, lasted from 2009 through 2015.Under the terms of her plea agreement, Flowers  sentencing range is 57-71 months in prison. She also was ordered to make $324,785 in restitution to DPS, and another $27,488 in restitution to the Internal Revenue Service for unpaid taxes. Via: Detroit FP",left-news,"May 4, 2016"
1738," BREAKING: It’s Real, Russia Stole Our Election And Now Officials Have Definitive PROOF","While we don t yet have the smoking gun that specifically says Donald Trump colluded with the Russians to win the presidency, US officials now have the blueprint that the Russians used to ensure that Hillary Clinton lost the election, and much of it will sound very familiar.According to three current and four former US officials, a Russian think tank controlled by Vladimir Putin used tried and true KGB tactics to make sure the election went exactly as they wanted.They described two confidential documents from the think tank as providing the framework and rationale for what U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded was an intensive effort by Russia to interfere with the Nov. 8 election. U.S. intelligence officials acquired the documents, which were prepared by the Moscow-based Russian Institute for Strategic Studies [en.riss.ru/], after the election.Source: ReutersThe first of the two documents was written in June. It didn t specifically mention Donald Trump, but it did outline a plan of using social media to sour voters toward any candidate who would share President Obama s hardline stance toward Russia.The second document was from October, just a month before the election:A second institute document, drafted in October and distributed in the same way, warned that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton was likely to win the election. For that reason, it argued, it was better for Russia to end its pro-Trump propaganda and instead intensify its messaging about voter fraud to undermine the U.S. electoral system s legitimacy and damage Clinton s reputation in an effort to undermine her presidency, the seven officials said.In other words, all the anti-Hillary, anti-DNC crap you heard during the election was straight out of Putin s playbook. From the right, while Trump was making accusations of voter fraud, you can be sure that his marching orders were coming from the Kremlin.The US officials are still remaining anonymous and American intelligence agencies are not commenting right now, but it s clear without Russia s campaign of fake news and their attempt to undermine confidence in our electoral system was exactly what Trump needed to win. The hacking wasn t part of the blueprint, but that was icing on the cake that came from another Kremlin source.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images.",News,"April 19, 2017"
9340,"OOPS! DOCUMENTS SHOW Roy Moore Represented Accuser’s Mother In “NASTY” Custody Case, Where She Won Custody Of 12-Yr Old Grandson…Accuser Also Plead “Guilty” To FELONY FRAUD Charges Against Family Member","Court documents related to Tina Johnson, an Alabama woman who claims that Republican senatorial candidate Roy Moore groped her in his office decades ago, may raise questions about Johnson s motives in making the accusation.The documents, reviewed by Breitbart News, show that Moore represented Johnson s mother in a nasty custody case for Johnson s then 12-year-old son, Daniel Sitz. In the case, Johnson was repeatedly painted by Moore s client as an unfit, absent, and unstable mother and was accused of taking her son from his elementary school against his will. Johnson s mother was ultimately awarded custody in the case.One affidavit signed by Johnson s mother while she was represented by Moore accused Johnson of having a  violent nature  and noted that she  has been treated by a psychiatrist when she was approximately 15 years of age.  Johnson was a teenage mother.Separate criminal documents show that, as late as 2010, Johnson was arrested and pled guilty to felony fraud charges related to checks belonging to a family member. She also entered a court drug program.Speaking to AL.com, Johnson first went public with the claim that Moore groped her when she was  on legal business with her mother  in 1991. The website noted that  Johnson reached out to AL.com  to discuss her alleged experience with Moore.The website related that Johnson was  at the office to sign over custody of her 12-year-old son to her mother, with whom he d been living. Johnson claimed that, after the two met with Moore, her mother walked out of the office door first and that, as Johnson was walking out, Moore grabbed her buttocks from behind.  He didn t pinch it; he grabbed it,  she claims.Watch, as Tina Johnson tells CNN s Erin Burnett the  details  of her alleged sexual assault by Judge Roy Moore. It s curious that a woman with Johnson s background vs. the squeaky clean background of Judge Roy Moore would attempt to prove that her faith was stronger, or more somehow more relevant than Roy Moore s faith. A document, signed by Moore, stated that Cofield   and not Johnson   was the  most fit and proper person  to have custody of Daniel Sitz.Johnson s son had resided with his grandmother, Cofield, since he was nine months old. Cofield says that, during those years, she provided Daniel with food, clothing, and shelter  without any assistance  from Johnson. A judge officially granted Cofield full custody on September 23, 1991.Last week, Breitbart News interviewed Delbra Adams, Moore s former longtime secretary and judicial assistant. Adams said that, in her 13 years of working for Moore, she never saw or experienced any inappropriate conduct toward women.Adams worked for Moore in 1991 at the time of Johnson s accusations. Adams s desk was right outside his office door at the time. Adams  name was signed as a notary on one of the custody documents filed in Johnson s case on behalf of Johnson s mother, Cofield.

432, Obama Pens STUNNING Response To Trump’s Cold-Blooded Move On DACA – Trump Fans Should Be Ashamed,"Trump is working his tail off to undo absolutely everything President Obama ever did, because the black man who once occupied the White House apparently hated all of America and everyone in it far more than His Royal Orangeness, and that includes ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. That program protects undocumented immigrants from deportation if they were brought into the country as children.That was one of Obama s more controversial executive orders, with Republicans all up and down the line calling it a gross overreach of executive power. But Trump s plan is more insidious than a belief that he s righting the wrongs of the previous administration. He promised to remove 11 million undocumented immigrants from the country, who (in his mind) are here because Obama and the Democrats favor open borders, and by golly, he s going to accomplish that even if it hurts innocent people.Like those protected by DACA.So Obama wrote an absolutely beautiful response to Trump s cold-blooded fuckery on Facebook, naming every single thing wrong with Trump s move, including that it is politically motivated and morally questionable. He also pointed out what should be obvious, but apparently isn t, to anyone who believes the GOP s lies: Kicking [these immigrants] out won t lower the unemployment rate, or lighten anyone s taxes, or raise anybody s wages. For eons, the GOP has been sending the message that undocumented immigrants are just one huge burden on us that we can t sustain. White, working-class Americans took that to mean that undocumented immigrants are one of the main reasons they re losing their jobs and can t make any headway in this economy.It s a matter of basic decency, according to Obama. He knows as well as the rest of us that Trump has no decency to him, because if he did, he wouldn t do this, let alone shirk his own responsibility for it by shifting it over to Congress: Ultimately, this is about basic decency. This is about whether we are a people who kick hopeful young strivers out of America, or whether we treat them the way we d want our own kids to be treated. It s about who we are as a people   and who we want to be. The ending of it is a subtle jab at those who claim strict adherence to the Constitution s letters, but not its spirit, like all those allegedly  Constitutional  Republicans and conservatives who blasted Obama over DACA, and now stand with the Racist-in-Chief on this.

6253, Hillary Wrote This Letter To Superdelegates In 2008 That Bernie Fans May Find Interesting,"Bernie Sanders supporters have been in an uproar about the Democratic National Committee s rules for primaries, specifically the use of  superdelegates.  A superdelegate is someone chosen by the party to represent their interests in a given state. They are unpledged, meaning they are able to vote for whoever they choose at the convention. Bernie Sanders supporters, especially the  Bernie or Bust  crowd   those who pledge to stay home or vote for Trump if Hillary gets the nomination   have decided that the use of superdelegates circumvents the democratic process, making it impossible for anyone but an establishment Democratic candidate to win.Let s put that into perspective real quick: If the RNC had the same rules they wouldn t be forced to nominate Donald Trump.Superdelegates act in the best interest of the party. There was a candidate in 2008 who learned first-hand that superdelegates can make or break a candidacy. Her name was Hillary Clinton. The expected nominee from the start of the primary season, Clinton found herself face-to-face with the up and coming Barack Obama, whose candidacy didn t truly flourish until half of the state primaries were over. As he gained in popularity and it became clear that he was the right choice for America to succeed Dubya, those  corrupt  superdelegates, tasked with securing the best interest of the party, began switching their support to Obama, who was ultimately nominated by quorum call on the convention floor by none other than Hillary Clinton.That s the way these things work. Bernie or Bust may be upset that all those independent voters didn t get to just walk into a Democratic primary and vote, but it really isn t anyone s fault but their own that they don t know the party rules. Primaries aren t general elections; they re nominating processes controlled by the parties. Make no mistake: If Bernie Sanders were in the lead or it looked like he was going to pull ahead, those superdelegates would shift their support and make sure the nominee was someone the registered voters of the party want to support.When Clinton was faced with the exact same scenario in 2008, she wrote a letter to the superdelegates of the party with one last plea for support. Her arguments include things like who polled better against the GOP, who had spent more years arguing progressive causes and who was ultimately more qualified to execute the office of the president:Dear ___________,The stakes in this election are so high: with two wars abroad, our economy in crisis here at home, and so many families struggling across America, the need for new leadership has never been greater.At this point, we do not yet have a nominee   and when the last votes are cast on June 3, neither Senator Obama nor I will have secured the nomination. It will be up to automatic delegates like you to help choose our party s nominee, and I would like to tell you why I believe I am the stronger candidate against Senator McCain and would be the best President and Commander in Chief.Voters in every state have made it clear that they want to be heard and counted as part of this historic race. And as we reach the end of the primary season, more than 17 million people have supported me in my effort to become the Democratic nominee   more people than have ever voted for a potential nominee in the history of our party. In the past two weeks alone, record numbers of voters participated in the West Virginia and Kentucky primaries. And with 40 and 35 point margins of victory, it is clear that even when voters are repeatedly told this race is over, they re not giving up on me   and I am not giving up on them either.After seven years of feeling invisible to the Bush administration, Americans are seeking a President who is strong, experienced, and ready to take on our toughest challenges, from serving as Commander in Chief and ending the war in Iraq to turning our economy around. They want a President who shares their core beliefs about our country and its future and  gets  what they go through every day to care for their families, pay the bills and try to put something away for the future.We simply cannot afford another four   or eight   years in the wilderness. That is why, everywhere I go, people come up to me, grip my hand or arm, and urge me to keep on running. That is why I continue in this race: because I believe I am best prepared to lead this country as President   and best prepared to put together a broad coalition of voters to break the lock Republicans have had on the electoral map and beat Senator McCain in November.Recent polls and election results show a clear trend: I am ahead in states that have been critical to victory in the past two elections. From Ohio, to Pennsylvania, to West Virginia and beyond, the results of recent primaries in battleground states show that I have strong support from the regions and demographics Democrats need to take back the White House. I am also currently ahead of Senator McCain in Gallup national tracking polls, while Senator Obama is behind him. And nearly all independent analyses show that I am in a stronger position to win the Electoral College, primarily because I lead Senator McCain in Florida and Ohio. I ve enclosed a detailed analysis of recent electoral and polling information, and I hope you will take some time to review it carefully.In addition, when the primaries are finished, I expect to lead in the popular vote and in delegates earned through primaries. Ultimately, the point of our primary process is to pick our strongest nominee   the one who would be the best President and Commander in Chief, who has the greatest support from members of our party, and who is most likely to win in November. So I hope you will consider not just the strength of the coalition backing me, but also that more people will have cast their votes for me.I am in this race for them   for all the men and women I meet who wake up every day and work hard to make a difference for their families. People who deserve a shot at the American dream   the chance to save for college, a home and retirement; to afford quality health care for their families; to fill the gas tank and buy the groceries with a little left over each month.I am in this race for all the women in their nineties who ve told me they were born before women could vote, and they want to live to see a woman in the White House. For all the women who are energized for the first time, and voting for the first time. For the little girls   and little boys   whose parents lift them onto their shoulders at our rallies, and whisper in their ears,  See, you can be anything you want to be.  As the first woman ever to be in this position, I believe I have a responsibility to them.Finally, I am in this race because I believe staying in this race will help unite the Democratic Party. I believe that if Senator Obama and I both make our case   and all Democrats have the chance to make their voices heard   everyone will be more likely to rally around the nominee.In the end, I am committed to unifying this party. What Senator Obama and I share is so much greater than our differences; and no matter who wins this nomination, I will do everything I can to bring us together and move us forward.But at this point, neither of us has crossed the finish line. I hope that in the time remaining, you will think hard about which candidate has the best chance to lead our party to victory in November. I hope you will consider the results of the recent primaries and what they tell us about the mindset of voters in the key battleground states. I hope you will think about the broad and winning coalition of voters I have built. And most important, I hope you will think about who is ready to stand on that stage with Senator McCain, fight for the deepest principles of our party, and lead our country forward into this new century.The letter was followed by 11 pages of statistics showing that even though she was behind, the race wasn t over. In the end it was the support of superdelegates that gave Obama the clear win.As a Bernie Sanders supporter, I would love to see the last melee of primaries go his way. A big win in California and a couple of other states and there s a chance Bernie becomes the best choice for the party, at which time he can realistically try to woo the superdelegates away from Clinton. If Hillary can hang on and secure the nomination, those of us who care about the future of our country will put our full support behind her.Featured image by NBC Newswire/Getty Images",News,"May 21, 2016"

Mark Steyn responds Posted by Tucker Carlson on Friday, September 29, 2017In case you missed the story of the teacher:Of course, as America has come to expect, Melania  fired back  at the hateful, liberal, public school librarian with class and dignity.  It s so refreshing to finally have a First Lady with class in the White House First lady Melania Trump fired back Friday at a Massachusetts elementary school librarian who rejected her donation of Dr. Seuss books, claiming their illustrations are examples of  racist propaganda. Stephanie Grisham, director of communications for the first lady s office, said in a statement to Fox News that the response was  unfortunate,  and Mrs. Trump wanted to use her platform  to help as many children as she can. She has demonstrated this in both actions and words since her husband took office, and sending books to children across the country is but one example,  she said.  To turn the gesture of sending young students some books into something divisive is unfortunate, but the First Lady remains committed to her efforts on behalf of children everywhere. To celebrate  National Read a Book Day,  the first lady had sent out a collection of 10 Dr. Seuss books to one school in each state across the nation. The titles included:  The Cat in the Hat ;  One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish ;  Wacky Wednesday ;  Green Eggs and Ham ; and  Oh, the Places You ll Go! She followed in the footsteps of her predecessor, Michelle Obama, who often read Dr. Seuss books to children. Former first ladies Hillary Clinton and Barbara Bush also read to children at Dr. Seuss-themed educational events.Remember when Mooch read Seuss to a room full of kids at the White House? Hmmm was Mooch promoting racism? To turn the gesture of sending young students some books into something divisive is unfortunate.    First lady Melania Trump s office I wanted to send you a special gift. Dr. Seuss s Oh, the Places You ll Go! is a book my son and I have read over and over again, and one that we want to share with all of you,  the first lady wrote in her letter to students.  Please also remember that you are the future of America and that you can accomplish anything you set your mind to. But despite the gesture, Liz Phipps Soeiro, a librarian at a public school in Cambridge, wrote a letter to the first lady, which was then published on The Horn Book blog, notifying Mrs. Trump that her school would  not be keeping the titles  for their collection, explaining that her school didn t have a  NEED  for the books, due to her school and library s  award-winning  status.  FOX News100 Percent Fed Up  Soeiro on Tuesday penned an editorial for the Horn Book s Family Reading blog explaining why her school did not need the donation. My students have access to a school library with over nine thousand volumes and a librarian with a graduate degree in literary science,  she wrote. Multiple studies show that schools with professionally staffed libraries improve student performance,  Soeiro added.Trump s package reportedly included such Seuss classics as  Green Eggs and Ham,   The Cat in the Hat  and  One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish. Soeiro criticized Seuss for being the only author represented in Trump s donation, citing controversy over some of his illustrations. You may not be aware of this, but Dr. Seuss is a bit of a clich , a tired and worn ambassador for children s literature,  she told Trump. Another fact that many people are unaware of is that Dr. Seuss s illustrations are steeped in racist propaganda, caricatures, and harmful stereotypes. I work in a district that has plenty of resources, which contributes directly to  excellence,  Soeiro wrote.  My students have access to a school library with over nine thousand volumes and a librarian with a graduate degree in library science. Soeiro went on to slam the White House and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos for not gifting the books to  underfunded and underprivileged communities,  which she suggested  continue to be marginalized  by DeVos  policies.But Soeiro seemed to be the most offended by the books themselves.Another FACT that many people are unaware that the HYPOCRITICAL and smug liberal librarian was seen CELEBRATING Dr. Seuss only 2 years ago:Here's D.C. librarian who rejected Melania's Dr. Seuss book donation ""steeped in racist propaganda"" as Cat in Hat. pic.twitter.com/pek3pT5q2W  Clay Travis (@ClayTravis) September 29, 2017",politics,"Sep 29, 2017"

CHICAGO REPORTEDLY FINDS At Least 14,000 More Votes Than Voters In 2016 Election","The head of the Chicago Republican Party is claiming the city reported thousands of more votes cast than voters in the 2016 election   sparking a battle with Chicago officials who call the allegations overblown.First reported by the Chicago City Wire, the Chicago GOP filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the Chicago Board of Elections in January for a list of voters who had cast ballots in November. According to the party, the board responded with a list of 1,101,178 individuals, though its website reflects 1,115,664 votes cast. There should never be more votes than voters every ballot cast should be recorded against a registered voter,  Chairman of the Chicago GOP Chris Cleveland told Fox News, explaining that after receiving the data, the party  immediately  contacted the board for  clarification.   This is either massive fraud or massive incompetence, but we have no way of telling the difference because they won t give us the data. The discrepancy totals more than 14,000, though Cleveland claims it could be as high as 16,000.Cleveland told Fox News he filed a number of FOIA requests the original in January, and  several follow ups  for updated numbers. They ignored them,  Cleveland said.  They have been stonewalling us for six months.

7000, Donald Trump Just Visited The 9/11 Museum And P*ssed EVERYONE Off (IMAGES/TWEETS),"Native New Yorker and Republican front runner Donald Trump made his first-ever visit to the 9/11 Memorial and Museum on Saturday afternoon, and ended up p*ssing everyone off in the process.With his third wife Melania at his side, the business mogul took a 30-minute tour through the museum, making the press wait outside for him to finish. While Trump might have enjoyed his little run-through of the museum, not everyone was happy about it   and many of them took to social media  o blast him for it.One Instagram user, josh_andew, posted a photo of the candidate and captioned it,  Ugh a Trump sighting in NYC #Hillary2016 #NoTrump :InstagramTwitter also blew up with insults directed at the GOP candidate, many bringing up the fact that Trump has been the most anti-Muslim candidate, and criticizing him for using the museum visit as a campaign stunt.TwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterThis tweet, in particular, nailed Trump s fake personality so well:TwitterNothing that Trump does is genuine, or without some sort of benefit in it for him. In the years between the opening of the museum and the start of his campaign, Trump was apparently too busy to pay his respects to the thousands of people who were killed in the terrorist attacks   even though he himself said that he  lost hundreds of friends  at the World Trade Center.But now because he s running for president, Trump is suddenly making it a priority to seem more appreciative of  New York values  than his rival Ted Cruz, who recently offended New Yorkers. It s obvious that blasting Cruz was part of Trump s plan all along when you read the end of this statement from Trump s campaign:This statement comes just a day after Trump blasted Cruz at a rally, saying: Remember when he started lecturing me on New York values like we re no good? We all know people who died, and I ve got this guy standing over there looking at me and talking to me about  New York values  with scorn on his face, with hatred of New York. Trump had also made a $100,000 donation to the museum, which never received a cent from Trump s charitable foundation before he was running for president. Actually, there isn t one 9/11-related nonprofit group that Trump made a contribution to until now, despite the fact that Trump feels so passionately about the rescue workers and survivors of the terror attacks. Trump doesn t give a damn about the victims, survivors or families affected by 9/11   he only cares about making himself look better. Featured image via Josh Andew Instagram",News,"April 9, 2016"
11911,MEDIA ATTACKS TAYLOR SWIFT Over Refusal To Criticize President-Elect Trump,"Tom Barnes mocks Taylor Swift in his latest article, as he writes:  One Instagram is the only evidence we have that Nashville elite Taylor Swift even knew there was an election taking place in 2016. Today is the day,  she wrote on Election Day.  Go out and VOTE. Today is the day. Go out and VOTE  A photo posted by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift) on Nov 8, 2016 at 8:01am PSTSo thirsty was the public for hints of Swift s political affiliations, that even an innocent picture of a voting line, stirred up a frenzy.  Who is Taylor Swift voting for?  skyrocketed in search queries, proving at the end of the cycle to have been one of the most popular search terms of the entire election.Fans read deeply into the symbolism of Swift s outfit and posture. Others took it as an opportunity to try to bait her into the political arena, pointing out her hypocrisy of having once styled herself as an outspoken feminist, only to back down at this most crucial moment. Admittedly some of those commentators had a point. It s difficult to look away from the fact that one of the most staunchly anti-woman candidates gallivanted into Washington followed by scores sexual assault accusations in tow, and Swift just watched.It is wrong to exploit feminism in order to sell records but then stand idly by as a misogynist ravages the country. Just FYI  Casey Mink (@Casey_Mink) November 8, 2016Swift remains to this day one of the only major A-list celebrities who has not weighed in on the election. Lady Gaga comforted fans distraught by Trump s successful attempts to reduce rape culture to  locker talk.  Kesha, Madonna, Beyonc , Nicki Minaj and Adele all connected with their fan bases to explain why Hillary Clinton offered the best way forward. Katy Perry literally did not stop singing and speaking for Clinton for the entirety of 2016. In a Time op-ed alongside a handful of clickier stunts, Swift bestie Lena Dunham said her support for Clinton was about far more than just  anatomy  or  girl power  Scores of artists have outright shamed the presidential inauguration committee for even asking to perform.Given her election silence, Swift has undoubtedly been approached, but her team has yet to offer a comment.A carefully chosen word of warning about the effect a successful Trump bid on normalizing misogyny or discrimination would have made for a natural extension of Swift s past desires to increase the level of public discourse around feminism. One could say the election is just another  narrative  she  never asked to be a part of,  and they would be correct. But if you re Swift, why not speak up? For every time she made sure that the word  feminism  was as close to her name in headlines, it feels odd she would pass on a lay-up as easy as helping clarify what  locker room talk  actually means. A close look at the fans she needs to please helps explain the silence. She caters to a white audience that used to be country and then crossed over into pop,  Ani Johnson, associate professor of Music Business at Berklee College of Music and international lecturer and consultant in music licensing, marketing and strategic startups, said in an email.  She has to  stay sweet,   stay demure    the perfect picture of the blond, blue-eyed, true blue, young American girl. She can t afford to speak up and lose sales from her red state, Republican base. It s clear to Johnson what that base wants:  a pretty girl who sings about love and has  effectively  nothing in her head.   Music.MicMeryl Streep s acceptance speech at the Golden Globes Award ceremony really backfired on her when conservatives in social media, and even some on the Left, were taken aback by her petulant attack on our President-elect Donald Trump.  Streep really gave her viewers an opportunity to see her mean, bully streak when she stood on the stage, and without any credible evidence to back it up, accused Trump of being a racist and demeaning a disabled reporter. Both of those claims are false, but who the hell needs facts when you re an Academy Award winning actress and can PRETEND they re true?The Left s obsession didn t start with Meryl Streep. As a matter of fact, some of the worst activists who mocked, lied and falsely accused Donald Trump of horrible things, were some of Taylor Swift s best friends.Hillary Clinton sycophant Lena Dunham, who admitted to sexually abusing her younger sister and lied to the world about being raped, likes to call Taylor Swift her  best friend.  She also promised to leave the country if Trump was elected. Unfortunately, she s still here. Her promise to leave the country was as honest as her manufactured claims about Donald Trump being a misogynist.Donald Trump hit back when Lena Dunham (along with a long list of  celebrities ) said she d leave the US if Trump won the election:Gigi Hadid can be seen frequently hanging out with Taylor Swift on Instagram and in the tabloids. Here s one of Swift s many photos with Hadid on her Instagram account:A photo posted by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift) on Apr 29, 2016 at 1:25am PDTKudos to Taylor Swift for sticking to performing, and staying out of the fray when it comes to President-elect Trump; even when it means she will be harshly criticized by the people in her business for not jumping on the  Hate-Trump  bandwagon. It can t be easy to keep out of discussion when the very people she calls her  besties  are some of the loudest anti-Trumpers in the business.",politics,"Jan 14, 2017"

Obama lied when he campaigned for the pipeline yet another political move to get elected. This guy is as dirty as they come Check this bs out from 3/22/12:President Obama said today he is expediting approval of the southern end of the Keystone XL oil pipeline   from Oklahoma to the Gulf Coast of Texas   and he criticized Republicans for turning an energy and environmental issue into a political one. The southern leg of it, we re making a priority,  Obama told workers during an 11-minute speech in Cushing, Okla., the terminus of the pipeline project.House Speaker John Boehner and other Republicans called Obama s permit announcement meaningless because the southern end of the project is due to start construction in June anyway. And they continued to criticize Obama for blocking the northern part of Keystone, connecting the U.S. to oil supplies in Canada.Boehner spokesman Brendan Buck compared Obama s announcement to  the governor holding a press conference to renew my driver s license   except this announcement still leaves American energy and jobs behind.

15309,"RUSH LIMBAUGH: TRUMP’S IMMIGRATION STANCE MAY WIN REPUBLICANS, DEMOCRATS AND INDEPENDENTS","Trump s not dropping in the polls in spite of the GOP and mainstream media s best efforts On The Rush Limbaugh Show, the popular conservative talk radio host discussed Donald Trump s immigration plan and told listeners that Trump s meteoric rise in the polls is entirely attributable to his mainstream position on immigration, which appeals to a broad array of voters.In a lengthy segment, Limbaugh laid out several of the policy items addressed in Trump s in-depth immigration proposal, such as ending birthright citizenship, deporting illegal immigrants, and building a border fence.Limbaugh argued that Trump s mainstream stance on immigration stands in stark contrast to the extreme position held by the open borders class that runs the country:Now, the inside-the-Beltway people, when they hear that, they cringe,  Oh, my God, don t say that s what Republicans [stand for]   oh, God.  [But the] people are standing up and cheering. They don t want their country given away, for crying out loud! [ ] I m telling you, that one has people standing up and cheering.Limbaugh explained that Trump s success is,  due to substance and it is due to immigration,  insisting that,  It s obvious that that issue is the foundational issue for Trump.  Limbaugh told listeners that Trump has used the issue of immigration to distinguish himself from all of the other Republican candidates currently running:It s amazing. Sixteen people are running for the presidency, and  15 of them are perceived to have essentially the same policy on immigration. One of them is entirely different from the other 15, and he s the one who s leading. Now, don t you think people inside the Beltway should be able to look at this and put two and two together and figure out what is causing this? They can chalk it up to celebrity, they can chalk it up to pop culture, they can chalk it up to circus.Limbaugh argued that Trump has been able to surpass all other Republican candidates because he has adopted a position on immigration that prioritizes the desires of the American voter above the desires of Republican donors and inside-the-beltway elites:Both parties, conservative-liberal, Republican-Democrat, I don t think they have the slightest idea what the vast majority of people in this country think about immigration and what s happening to the country, and they don t want any part of it. And of course the establishment is seen as wanting to ramrod their view of immigration down everybody s throat. Trump s the only guy standing up against it  I don t think these people have any idea just how angry, frightened, fearful, a pretty big majority of the people in this country are, that we are losing the country, and we re losing it because of immigration  And they see both parties in cahoots to make it happen, and they don t understand it. People that love America do not understand this. I mean, even when you tell  em,  Well, big-money donors say this because they want X, Y, and Z,  it still doesn t make any sense. How does that trump patriotism? How does all that matter more to these people, elected officials, than patriotism, love of country, America, shining city on a hill and all that, why does that not matter anymore? And there isn t a single candidate for president addressing the issue in a way that resonates with the American people, particularly Republican primary voters, not one, until Donald Trump comes along.Limbaugh explained that Trump s position represents the mainstream view on immigration:  Trump is not seen as a radical at all in this by average, ordinary Americans. He s not seen as an extremist. He s not seen as a fringe kook.  Instead,  Trump s ideas are not fringe, are not outliers, they are mainstream. They represent the views and the attitudes of the people who make this country work. To reinforce this point, Limbaugh highlighted a recent article by The Washington Examiner s Byron York which  found a recent academic paper published by Stanford Professor David Broockman and Berkeley PhD candidate Douglas Ahler, and it suggests a majority of the public s views on immigration are closer to Trump s than to the advocates of comprehensive immigration reform. Limbaugh argued that by embracing a platform of immigration moderation   i.e. returning immigration to lower, more normal historical levels from today s surging record highs  Trump will appeal to a wide-range of Democratic and Independent voters.Republican Party officials, inside-the-Beltway officials tell us that we can t win the White House anymore without getting additional votes besides just Republican votes  We need to get Democrats. We need to get independents  Okay, fine, well, guess what, who s doing that? Who is expanding the party beyond what it is normally thought to be? Trump, of all people. And yet they re lowering the hammer on the guy each and every day, when it is Donald Trump who is executing what the Republican Party says they need to win.Indeed, polling commissioned by the National Republican Senate Committee (NRSC) recently found that a populist position on immigration has mass appeal amongst women, minorities, and non-Republican voters in addition to the base of Republican voters.Limbaugh believes that other Republican candidates could see similar success if they were to adopt Trump s position on immigration:If just one of these Republican candidates   just one of them   had come out forcefully for America on this immigration business, Trump wouldn t even exist as a candidate. Well, he might exist, but he wouldn t have such a free road in this one issue.In fact, Limbaugh predicted that Trump s announcement will influence many candidates on the critical issue of immigration:The me-toos are beginning.  Hey, my proposal is just like Trump s.  You watch  The me-toos are now starting. Rather than people trying to steal it, people are gonna want to get in on it. It has the potential here to be a genuine movement, so transformative that the inside-the-Beltway people, even while studying it and looking straight at it, still stand a chance of being blindsided by it.Limbaugh also made the larger point that much of the hand-wringing in the GOP over Trump s immigration platform is curious given that uncontrolled immigration has put one of the largest states in America firmly outside the reach of the GOP, and if it is not curtailed, more states like Virginia will follow:If you want to find the future of the Republican Party and the country, look at California. There isn t a single Republican in statewide office. There never will be in the future. It s not gonna happen. The Republican Party practically doesn t exist statewide. The economy in California, you talk about inequality, the haves and have-nots, it s no more pronounced anywhere in the country than in California.You don t have to go back that far where the Republican Party owned it. Routinely elected governors, those governors became presidential candidates. And I ll tell you when you can tie it to. You can tie the end of the Republican Party in California to 1986, and that was the Simpson-Mazzoli amnesty immigration bill. We re talking back then 3.9 million illegal aliens granted amnesty. Since then it s been curtains for the Republican Party, which means constant victory for the Democrat Party. They have shaped that state, and it s a mess. And it s a harbinger of where we re going nationwide. Via: Breitbart",politics,"Aug 17, 2015"
3043, Republicans Just Moved To Repeal Obamacare. They Never Expected Americans To Respond Like THIS (TWEETS),"President Barack Obama accomplished many great things in his 8 years as President of the United States, and he undoubtedly took America to heights greater than the mess he inherited when he first came into office.One of Obama s most notable presidential accomplishments was Obamacare, also know as the Affordable Care Act   an initiative that gave more Americans than ever access to affordable healthcare that they may not have been eligible for beforehand. Unfortunately, now that the GOP has taken back control of Congress with its disastrous President-elect Donald Trump, the Republican Party is making moves to undo all of Obama s hard work   starting with health care.Late on Wednesday night, the Senate made a disgustingly sneaky move toward repealing the Affordable Care Act, and shot down proposed amendments to protect Americans with preexisting conditions from discrimination and losing coverage.TwitterOn Thursday morning, Americans across the country woke up to a nightmare. Not only did they discover that the Senate was making fast moves to gut the Affordable Care Act, but many of them would be facing life or death consequences thanks to the Republican Party s agenda. As one woman said to Rep. Keith Ellison (D -MN) on Twitter, As a breast cancer survivor, this is a death sentence for me.  She was far from alone in that fear.Before Republicans knew it, people from across the country were using the hashtag #SaveTheACA to vent both their despair and desperation.

Of course, he s failing miserably at all of these   but he just got called out in a major way.Apparently oblivious to the fact that the whole country knows his inauguration is an embarrassment because no respectable celebrity wants to perform for him, Trump told an insane lie about how popular his inauguration was going to be   despite the fact that his parade has been significantly shortened due to its unpopularity. Trump actually said that so many people would be attending his inauguration that all the dress shops in Washington were sold out! He said in an interview with The New York Times: We are going to have an unbelievable, perhaps record-setting turnout for the inauguration, and there will be plenty of movie and entertainment stars. All the dress shops are sold out in Washington. It s hard to find a great dress for this inauguration. Everyone is shocked by this statement   especially the shopkeepers in Washington, who actually have tons of evening gowns available! In an amazing fact-check by The Washington Post, VP and manager of Friendship Heights  Neiman Marcus store Martha Slagle was quoted debunking Trump s lies: Definitely not. You have more than a thousand evening gowns to choose from. Slagle also said her store was  stuffed with beautiful gowns  and that other smaller stores  always have dresses  because stores stock up ahead of the inauguration in case there is a high demand (however, there doesn t seem to be).

A federal government agency run by an Obama crony attempting to penetrate the firewall of a State agency tasked with overseeing the elections? What conceivable reason could Obama s DHS have for hacking the Georgia Sec of State s office after the election?Georgia s secretary of state has claimed the Department of Homeland Security tried to breach his office s firewall and has issued a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson asking for an explanation.Brian Kemp issued a letter to Johnson on Thursday after the state s third-party cybersecurity provider detected an IP address from the agency s Southwest D.C. office trying to penetrate the state s firewall. According to the letter, the attempt was unsuccessful.The attempt took place on Nov. 15, a few days after the presidential election. The office of the Georgia Secretary of State is responsible for overseeing the state s elections. At no time has my office agreed to or permitted DHS to conduct penetration testing or security scans of our network,  Kemp wrote in the letter, which was also sent to the state s federal representatives and senators.  Moreover, your department has not contacted my office since this unsuccessful incident to alert us of any security event that would require testing or scanning of our network. This is especially odd and concerning since I serve on the Election Cyber Security Working Group that your office created. The Department of Homeland Security has received Secretary Kemp s letter,  a DHS spokesperson told CyberScoop.  We are looking into the matter.

Johnson announced shortly after the election that DHS found no evidence of an attack on Election Day.In the months and weeks leading up to the election fake news sources like The Washington Post did everything in their power to convince Americans that Georgia was in play for Hillary: The attempt took place on Nov. 15, a few days after the presidential election. The office of the Georgia Secretary of State is responsible for overseeing the state s elections. At no time has my office agreed to or permitted DHS to conduct penetration testing or security scans of our network,  Kemp wrote in the letter, which was also sent to the state s federal representatives and senators.  Moreover, your department has not contacted my office since this unsuccessful incident to alert us of any security event that would require testing or scanning of our network. This is especially odd and concerning since I serve on the Election Cyber Security Working Group that your office created.

Leftist news sources like The Washington Post tried to convince voters that Hillary had a shot at winning the solidly red state of Georgia: A new Atlanta Journal-Constitution poll of the presidential race in that state puts Hillary Clinton in a slight lead over Donald Trump, 44 to 40. This is inside-the-margin-of-error stuff, mind you, but only barely. (It s also a break from the state of the race in the RealClearPolitics polling average, which gives Trump a four-point lead, though with only a handful of polls included.)Georgia has been shifting a bit politically in recent presidential elections, becoming slightly less Republican relative to the rest of the country   but it still has been voting more Republican than America on the whole. So in 2012, when Barack Obama won by four points, Mitt Romney won Georgia by eight   making the state 12 points more Republican, just a tick less than it was in 2008.With so many forces, and resources being used against Donald J. Trump, it s absolutely amazing he won the election ",left-news,"Dec 9, 2016"

7639, Obama Just Got A Little More Than Pissed At Those Claiming He’s Soft On Wall Street,"When President Obama took office in January of 2009, the United States of America was on the brink of utter economic collapse. Jobs were being lost at the rate of 750K per month, but have made consistent gains throughout all of Obama s tenure as Commander-in-Chief. Part of bringing us back from the worst recession since the Great Depression included several Wall Street reforms and a Credit Card Bill of Rights.Clearly, we ve come along way from the financial crisis that took place from 2007-2009, and sure, we have a long way to go to ensure that sort of crisis doesn t happen again, but President Obama had some choice words for those who claim he s been soft on Wall Street.On Monday, while standing with Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen and several other top regulators, the president stated: I want to emphasize this because it is popular in the media and the political discourse, both on the left and the right, to suggest that the crisis happened and nothing happened. That is not true. I want to dispel the notion that exists both on the left and on the right that somehow, after the crisis, nothing happened. We did not just rebuild this, we rebuilt it better, and we ve rebuilt it stronger. According to Reuters: Obama said regulators appear set by the end of the year to have achieved most of the goals he set out for the financial system in 2008, when he first took office, although he noted there was still work to do on rules for hedge funds and asset managers in what he called the  shadow banking system. He then explained why that work hasn t been done yet: One of our projects is to make sure that we are covering some of those potential gaps. We may need at some point help from Congress to do that. Which is exactly right. In order for those gaps to be filled we need Congress to cooperate, and it s not enough to just blame leadership, we have to hold our Congresspeople accountable. That s why elections, and not just presidential elections, matter so much. Republicans want to weaken regulations and make it possible for the practices that caused the financial crisis to occur, to create a future crisis. If anything, we need to embrace and expand President Obama ideas and goals on Wall Street, not condemn them. He has every right to be mad at those claiming he s done nothing, because that s an outright lie.Featured image: White House flickr",News,"March 7, 2016"
13269,MOTHER WRITES SCATHING LETTER TO HILLARY: “You have made it easy to teach my daughter who she does not want to aspire to be”,"Dear Mrs. Clinton,Congratulations on securing the Democratic nomination for president of the United States. It s historical! It s liberating to women! You ve broken the glass ceiling!But at what cost?As the mother of a beautiful young daughter, my desire is to teach her every day that she is priceless, valuable and precious beyond anything else in this world. I tell her that God has placed her on this earth for a very specific reason. I make sure that she never doubts her place here.How exciting it would be for us to celebrate the accomplishments of the first woman ever to receive the presidential nomination of a major political party! Wouldn t it be amazing if I were able to point my daughter to someone she could look up to and admire? Unfortunately for myself, my daughter and millions of other women in this nation, I can t.Sadly, Mrs. Clinton, you have shown not only my daughter but all daughters and not only in this country but globally that in order to, in your words,  shatter the gla  you have to lie, cheat, abuse, insult, bully and ignore. You threaten others along with disrespecting yourself.Mrs. Clinton, how can I possibly tell my daughter to follow you as an example after you allowed your husband to assault and demean multiple women throughout his political career? Were those women not important? Tell me, will you fight for my rights like you fought for those womens ? Ummmm, I hope not. What about the sisterhood, Mrs. Clinton? Did you expose your husband for his abuse? No! Instead, you enabled him as the abuser and tried to silence his victims. How can you live with yourself? Female empowerment? Nice try!How can you get up and speak about income equality and then pay your own male executives considerably more than your female staff? How can you receive donations from countries that publicly abuse, shame and even execute their own women? Yet you continue to boast about how you stand for women s rights. Double standard?You try your best to relate to those of us who work hard every day to achieve the American dream. You, however, know nothing of struggle. That $12,000 Armani jacket? Those $250,000 speaking fees? They speak volumes. Hypocrisy?How could I possibly ask my daughter to look up to and trust you? Do you honestly think that you are an example to American children? My daughter watches the news. She has heard about the Americans who were attacked and slaughtered in a foreign land while you stood by and did nothing. Then, with their blood on your hands, you did everything you could to cast the blame on others, eventually telling Congress,  What does it matter now?  Dishonesty?The fact of the matter is, Mrs. Clinton, that you are no champion of women. You are selling the women of this country a false bill of goods. Unfortunately, many are buying in. I don t want you fighting for me or my daughter. You have the interests of only one woman in mind here: your own. You have done nothing to bring the United States together. Quite the contrary you have done your best to divide, and you have succeeded. Congratulations. You crave power, and you will do whatever it takes to get it. You have lied, cheated and let down your own country.My prayer, Mrs. Clinton, is that I would be able to teach my daughter how to be a true woman. A strong woman. A self-respecting woman. A woman who sees herself through the eyes of her Creator. I pray that she would be a woman of compassion, kindness, service, selflessness. One who has integrity and looks out for the needs of others.In a way, I guess I should thank you, Mrs. Clinton. You have made it easy to teach my daughter who she does not want to aspire to be. Now may I have the courage to stand up and show her the woman she does want to be.Sincerely,Helen WickertP.S. By the way, I will pray for the next U.S. president, whether it is Donald Trump or you. God tells us to do so, and He can turn any heart toward righteousness and truth.Via: courageousmotherhood",politics,"Aug 12, 2016"
20990,DEMOCRAT LAWMAKER Puts Forth Bill Requiring Wife’s Permission For Men To Obtain Viagra Prescription,"Leave it to a Democrat to waste everyone s time and money by putting forth legislation she knows has no chance of passing, as a means to convince legislators they need to make it easier to kill an unborn child. A Kentucky lawmaker has put forward a bill that would require men to visit a doctor at least twice and obtain a signed permission slip from their wives before they could obtain a prescription for the erectile dysfunction drug Viagra.State Rep. Mary Lou Marzian, a Democrat, acknowledged to the Louisville Courier-Journal that the bill has no chance of passing. However, she said the bill was a response to several anti-abortion measures, including a recently ratified law that requires a woman seeking an abortion to get counseling at least 24 hours in advance from a health professional.In an opinion piece, Marzian said her bill is meant to  illustrate the absurdity of government encroachment into women s personal and medical decisions currently running amok in the Kentucky General Assembly and [Gov. Matt] Bevin administration. Marzian s bill specifies that only married men can obtain Viagra and a prospective patient must  make a sworn statement with his hand on a Bible that he will only use a prescription for a drug for erectile dysfunction when having sexual relations with his current spouse. Other state lawmakers have filed similar bills to make political points. In 2012, a bill from an Ohio state senator required men to get a psychological evaluation before getting a Viagra prescription and last year a South Carolina state representative filed a bill that would require men to wait 24 hours before getting a prescription.Marzian has also said she would file a bill requiring potential gun buyers to undergo counseling from victims of gun violence 24 hours in advance of the purchase.

11017,LOU DOBBS UNLOADS On “Inept” Paul Ryan For Denying Trump Progress On Promises: “Working Against The President And His Agenda At Every Turn” [VIDEO],"Lou Hobbs praised President Donald Trump for his historic first 100 days in office, including being the first president to have a nominated US Supreme Court Justice take his seat on the high court in a president s first 100 days since 1881. He then went on a punishing rant against Republican Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, who he blames for holding Trump back from any major legislative accomplishments. Dodd explained how Trump has been denied success by his very own party to his viewers: The President however, has been denied a significant legislative accomplishment on the big issues because of uh Not because of the opposition of the Dems, but rather because of a Speaker of the House of the same Republican Party who has been woefully inadequate to the responsibilities and demands of his office. Speaker Ryan, working against the President and his agenda at every turn, frustrating the entire GOP conference Congress and indeed the American people. President Trump has been gracious, he s been generous even with the inept Ryan, but the President today acknowledging that he is disappointed.   Hobbs went on to rave about President Trump and his accomplishments over his first 100 days in office. He even went as far as to compare Trump s accomplishments to those of FDR. Dobbs again went on to remind his viewers that President Trump will need the full support of the elected Republican leaders in Congress if he is to accomplish all that he promised the voters he would do if elected: If Speaker Ryan and the Republican leaders in Congress were for whatever reason, to turn their full support for this President and his agenda, the next 100 days of his term would be even more remarkable than his first. On this never-before-released private October conference call with House Republican members, House Speaker Paul Ryan told his members in the U.S. House of Representatives he was abandoning then-GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump forever and would never defend him ever again.Listen to the call that was obtained by Breitbart News reporter Matthew Boyle: ",politics,"Apr 29, 2017"
4548, George H.W. Bush May Have Just Dealt An Incredibly Stinging Blow To The Trump Train,"Guess who George H.W. Bush is voting for? He lost to Bill Clinton in 1992, and his son is George W. Bush. Yet it seems that the elder Bush finds Trump so distasteful a candidate that he s actually going to cast his vote for Hillary Clinton.According to Politico, Bush Sr. had originally planned on keeping quiet about this election. Considering the fact that he s a Republican, and therefore expected to weigh in on the side of the Republicans  chosen candidate, this is actually pretty major. But it wasn t Bush himself who revealed his vote. It was Kathleen Kennedy Townsend daughter of the late Robert Kennedy who let this particular interesting tidbit slip: On Monday, Townsend posted a picture on her Facebook page shaking hands next to the former president and this caption:  The President told me he s voting for Hillary!!' She stood by that later on when talking to Politico. According to her, George H.W. Bush would rather vote for his former rival and successor s wife than the god-awful train wreck that is Donald Trump.A spokesman for the Bush family refused to actually confirm this   he said that George H.W. s vote is a private decision and will remain so. He himself isn t commenting, but it seems that those who are in his inner circle aren t being so tight-lipped, if Kennedy is to be believed.Bush Sr. did make it clear back in May that he had absolutely zero intention of endorsing Trump. That s a bold, but wise, move for any Republican, since Republicans are supposed to be on the side of freedom and Trump is on the side of dictatorship and authoritarianism.His love of Russian president Vladimir Putin would suggest that he s also on the side of autocracy. None of these three things meshes with the democracy Republicans say we ve built in even the smallest way.Earlier in the summer, an administration official for George W. Bush announced that she would vote for Hillary, adding her name to an ever-growing list of Republicans and conservatives who can t find it within themselves to support Trump. Jeb Bush has said he can neither vote for Hillary nor Trump.A former Republican president refusing to stand for the current Republican nominee is a stinging blow indeed.Featured image by Scott Halleran/Getty Images",News,"September 20, 2016"
2370, Reince Priebus Facing Misconduct Complaint For Interfering With FBI’s Russia Investigation,"Reince Priebus, Donald Trump s chief of staff, is now facing a misconduct complaint related to his decision to interfere with the FBI s investigation of Russia.Attorney J. Whitfield Larrabee filed the complaint with the Wisconsin Office of Lawyer Regulation regarding Priebus  attempt to persuade the FBI to favor Trump in their investigation of the Russian scandal that has plagued the administration.The complaint reads:There is probable cause to charge attorney Reince Priebus ( Priebus ) with violations of Wisconsin s Rules of Professional Conduct for Attorneys, Supreme Court Rules, Chapter 20. The violations of these rules relate to Priebus  corrupt attempt to influence investigations by the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) into criminal activity involving associates of Donald J. Trump ( Trump ) and Russian government officials. .It is a violation of SCR 20:8.4 (b) for a lawyer to  commit a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer s honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects.  It is a violation of SCR 20:8.4 (c)  to engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.  There is probable cause to charge Priebus with such serious violations of these particular ethical requirements that it will be necessary and appropriate to revoke his license to practice of law if the charges are established.Larrabee explained that he  filed the complaint as a concerned citizen and attorney because I was alarmed that Reince Priebus would communicate with the FBI about a pending investigation of the collusion between Trump campaign officials and senior Russian intelligence officials. Communications by Priebus with the FBI about a pending investigation of this sort severely violates the integrity of the investigation and is a blatant form of corruption. While it isn t really likely that this complaint will bring about any real repercussions for Priebus, it does send a very important message: even if Republicans won t stand up to Trump s administration and hold them accountable, the citizens of the United States will.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"February 27, 2017"

7542, Oklahoma House Votes To Let Domestic Abusers Open Carry Guns – Because Jesus (VIDEO),"You know what would be really stupid? If a group of legislators got together and said,  Hey, you know what would be a good idea? Allowing violent people who beat their wives and children to openly carry firearms.  This idea seems so ridiculous that even the most die-hard Second Amendment cheerleaders could not stand behind it   but that s exactly what happened in the Oklahoma House of Representatives Thursday.House Bill 3098, authored by state Rep. Jeff Coody (R-Insane), that carrying a firearm is a right guaranteed by both the Constitution and God. According to Coody and the bill s co-authors, Bible-believing Christians have a right to defend themselves. Coody says that the Second Amendment is the most important thin in the Bill of Rights, which can not be infringed upon   even, of course, if someone beats his entire family with a crowbar. It s the ultimate freedom bill regarding open carry,  Coody said of his bill, with Rep Jeff Bennett adding that It s our God-given right to defend ourself. Is it a good idea to let anyone carry a gun, even if they don t know how to use it or even where the safety is?  Democratic Rep. Emily Virgin asked during debate on the bill   but Coody shut her down with a burst of stupidity: The key word is  let.  Somehow we ve gotten the idea that the government has to give us permission to exercise our freedoms. That is totally antithetical to me. The bill precludes felons from open carry, but does not prevent those under domestic violence protective orders from waving their firearms around. In addition, it does not require safety course, training, or anything that a reasonable person would consider necessary for responsible firearm use. Asked why gun owners are not required to receive training, Coody explained: Because driving is privilege. The Second Amendment is a constitutional right. But what about my safety?  Rep. Mike Brown asked.  Doesn t the government have a responsibility to protect me? No,  Coody said, asserting that more guns make people safer even though rapes in Oklahoma are at a 10-year high since the state passed a concealed carry law. Coody might be interested to know that regularions in the automobile industry drastically reduced deaths-by-car between 1950 and 2014, proving that reasonable safety regulations can have a very positive effect. Interestingly, the government did not enact a massive car-grab, and people are still able to drive if they receive the proper training and licensing   just as it should be with guns.While we might expect that Republicans could compromise, they have already done so. The bill originally removed licensing and training requirements for concealed carry, as well. The bill passed with an astounding 73-15 vote, with 13 abstaining.Coody s legislation will now go to the state Senate, where hopefully it will be modified to include training requirement, or at least prevent domestic abusers from marching with their gun on display 301 feet from their victims  houses  or killed altogether. If that doesn t happen, Rep. Virgin has a sobering prediction: Guns and domestic violence are main problems. Women die of it every day. Increasing access to guns without training, without background checks, women will die because of that.

5725, President Obama’s Approval Rating Has Climbed To A Five Year High,"A new poll released from ABC/Washington Post shows some very good news for Democrats: not only is Hillary Clinton crushing Donald Trump, but President Obama s approval rating has hit a five year high   topping off at 56 percent of people who approve of him   a five point gain from the last poll conducted. Only 41 percent disapprove.The last time President Obama s approval rating was that high was when Osama bin Laden was killed in May 2011. It s also worth noting that the President s approval rating was taken in the immediate aftermath of the Orlando shooting, the deadliest terror attack on U.S. soil since 9/11.But wait, there s more good news: not only does 56 percent of the American electorate approve of President Obama s presidency overall, 55 percent approve (42 disapprove) of his handling of the economy. Considering Trump likes to paint himself as the  best  man to handle the economy, the news should offer him and his campaign a much needed wake up call.As the Post noted:Obama is more popular now than Republicans George W. Bush and George H.W. Bush in the waning months of their presidencies. Although Obama s approval rating has not reached the level of former Democratic president Bill Clinton s in 2000, his standing suggests that he could be a relatively effective surrogate for Hillary Clinton on the campaign trail.Just think about it   Clinton already has a huge lead over Trump, and that s before the very popular President Obama has hit the campaign trail. Once Americans see what will be leaving and what might be succeeding them, one could expect to see not only Clinton s poll numbers to rise, but Obama s as well.So what say you, Republicans? A healthy majority of Americans support the president and loathe your candidate. I don t think Republicans get to talk about the  will  of the American people anymore. They have no ground to stand on, no leverage, and no one seems to be taking them seriously anymore.President Reagan s final year approval high was 65 percent, just nine points higher than President Obama s. The President still has six more months, and considering how unpopular Donald Trump is becoming, America should expect to see it climb higher.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"June 26, 2016"
1386," Trump Defies Courts, Refuses To Release Guiliani Memo Proving Intent To Ban Muslims","Donald Trump has repeatedly shown that he has zero respect for the independent judiciary. Every time a judge rules in a way he dislikes, he attacks the judge, the court system, and claims that he is the victim of some kind of political witch hunt. Therefore, it should come as no surprise that he has flat-out refused to hand over a key memo, drawn up by mega Trump fan and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani.We all remember how Giuliani went on Fox News and admitted that Trump had asked him to find a way to keep the oft-touted campaign promise of banning Muslims   but, of course, to make sure whatever order they came up with to do that passed Constitutional muster. Given these damning words, it s no surprise that Trump doesn t want a judge to see the memo that Giuliani drew up for him. The American Civil Liberties Union is taking Trump s lawlessness on, though. Miriam Aukerman, Senior Staff Attorney for the ACLU of Michigan, says of the situation: If, as the administration claims, the Executive Order is not a Muslim Ban, then why is the administration refusing to turn over the Giuliani memo? What is in that document that the government doesn t want the court to see? The ACLU, along with several state Attorneys General and other civil rights organizations have sued Trump and his government over the obvious discrimination, and it is pretty clear that they are not done fighting.Trump was supposed to have that memo to a judge in Detroit by May 19, and it has yet to materialize. We all know why   Trump s Executive Order is most definitely a Muslim ban, and that memo will show it. Hell, I don t know who they think they are fooling here. Giuliani himself admitted that this is what Trump had asked him to do. We also, of course, have Trump s own words to prove exactly what the intent is here as well.Trump is quickly learning that no one is above the law in this nation   not even the so-called  president.

While definitive information about the lawsuit wasn t offered up, Bendekovic did make it clear that she thinks that Watters is in no position to speak for Santa Claus. I don t think you should be voicing your opinion what Santa wants and what Santa doesn t want,  she shot back.According to the Sun Sentinel, the Hyatts have been battling with officials for years over the size and scale of the display, with the city   which considers it a nuisance   filing a lawsuit earlier this year to stop it.After years of arguing with the Hyatts to scale back the display, the city sued this year to quash the spectacle, which officials consider a neighborhood nuisance. A scheduled hearing did not take place over the summer as planned and has not yet been rescheduled.In addition to the lawsuit, the family claims on its official website that it faces $250 per day in fines for continuing the show, citing  government interference  as being at the root of the dispute. Here s a portion of a petition that is posted on the  Hyatt Extreme Christmas  website:By signing this petition, you show your support for Hyatt Extreme Christmas, a 20 year-old tradition, which has been entertaining, inspiring and motivating families from around Plantation and South Florida.The Hyatt s take great joy in creating memories for children both young and old during this special time of year. Our community can see our display of more than 200,000 lights for FREE. We give back to our community by raising awareness and funds for charitable partners such as Humane Society, Broward Food Bank and Support for the Military working with the Red Cross  Holiday Cards for Heroes .Despite facing legal woes, the Hyatts are back at it this year, bringing their display to the masses. The husband and wife duo took Watters through the display, and he interviewed some locals who fully support it. They re just not making money on this and they wanted money from us,  he said, claiming that city officials wanted the family to charge admission for the free display.  When we wouldn t give it to them, all the sudden we re in court. Via: The Blaze",politics,"Dec 18, 2015"
23069,Washington Post Deceives Public & Profits From Fake News,"21st Century Wire says The Washington Post has been caught lying and deceiving the public twice in the last few weeks pushing the unfounded mainstream media meme that Russia invaded the U.S. electric grid and another claiming that Russia is behind the explosion of so-called  fake news. Considering that the power grid story was proven to be a fake news story that WashPost had to later retract  We have to consider the legitimacy of any further claims the outlet has against Russia as particularly dubious.The Intercept has some interesting analysis on how outlets such as WashPost not only deceive the public, push false state sponsored talking points but also how they profit financially from this collusion. Glenn Greenwald The InterceptIn the past six weeks, the Washington Post published two blockbuster stories about the Russian threat that went viral: one on how Russia is behind a massive explosion of  fake news,  the other on how it invaded the U.S. electric grid. Both articles were fundamentally false. Each now bears a humiliating editor s note grudgingly acknowledging that the core claims of the story were fiction: The first note was posted a full two weeks later to the top of the original article; the other was buried the following day at the bottom.The second story on the electric grid turned out to be far worse than I realized when I wrote about it on Saturday, when it became clear that there was no  penetration of the U.S. electricity grid  as the Post had claimed. In addition to the editor s note, the Russia-hacked-our-electric-grid story now has a full-scale retraction in the form of a separate article admitting that  the incident is not linked to any Russian government effort to target or hack the utility  and there may not even have been malware at all on this laptop.But while these debacles are embarrassing for the paper, they are also richly rewarding. That s because journalists   including those at the Post   aggressively hype and promote the original, sensationalistic false stories, ensuring that they go viral, generating massive traffic for the Post (the paper s executive editor, Marty Baron, recently boasted about how profitable the paper has become).After spreading the falsehoods far and wide, raising fear levels and manipulating U.S. political discourse in the process (both Russia stories were widely hyped on cable news), journalists who spread the false claims subsequently note the retraction or corrections only in the most muted way possible, and often not at all. As a result, only a tiny fraction of people who were exposed to the original false story end up learning of the retractions.Baron himself, editorial leader of the Post, is a perfect case study in this irresponsible tactic. It was Baron who went to Twitter on the evening of November 24 to announce the Post s expos  of the enormous reach of Russia s fake news operation, based on what he heralded as the findings of  independent researchers.  Baron s tweet went all over the place; to date, it has been re-tweeted more than 3,000 times, including by many journalists with their own large followings:Russian propaganda effort helped spread fake news during election, say independent researchers https://t.co/3ETVXWw16Q  Marty Baron (@PostBaron) November 25, 2016But after that story faced a barrage of intense criticism   from Adrian Chen in the New Yorker ( propaganda about Russia propaganda ), Matt Taibbi in Rolling Stone ( shameful, disgusting ), my own article, and many others   including legal threats from the sites smeared as Russian propaganda outlets by the Post s  independent researchers    the Post finally added its lengthy editor s note distancing itself from the anonymous group that provided the key claims of its story ( The Post   does not itself vouch for the validity of PropOrNot s findings  and  since publication of the Post s story, PropOrNot has removed some sites from its list ).What did Baron tell his followers about this editor s note that gutted the key claims of the story he hyped? Nothing. Not a word. To date, he has been publicly silent about these revisions. Having spread the original claims to tens of thousands of people, if not more, he took no steps to ensure that any of them heard about the major walk back on the article s most significant, inflammatory claims. He did, however, ironically find the time to promote a different Post story about how terrible and damaging Fake News is: Pizzagate  shows how fake news hurts real people https://t.co/cOh7RZ4RqK  Marty Baron (@PostBaron) November 26, 2016WHETHER THE POST S false stories here can be distinguished from what is commonly called  Fake News  is, at this point, a semantic dispute, particularly since  Fake News  has no cogent definition. Defenders of Fake News as a distinct category typically emphasize intent in order to differentiate it from bad journalism. That s really just a way of defining Fake News so as to make it definitionally impossible for mainstream media outlets like the Post ever to be guilty of it (much the way terrorism is defined to ensure that the U.S. government and its allies cannot, by definition, ever commit it).But what was the Post s motive in publishing two false stories about Russia that, very predictably, generated massive attention, traffic, and political impact? Was it ideological and political   namely, devotion to the D.C. agenda of elevating Russia into a grave threat to U.S. security? Was it to please its audience   knowing that its readers, in the wake of Trump s victory, want to be fed stories about Russian treachery? Was it access and source servitude   proving it will serve as a loyal and uncritical repository for any propaganda intelligence officials want disseminated? Was it profit   to generate revenue through sensationalistic click-bait headlines with a reckless disregard to whether its stories are true? In an institution as large as the Post, with numerous reporters and editors participating in these stories, it s impossible to identify any one motive as definitive.Whatever the motives, the effects of these false stories are exactly the same as those of whatever one regards as Fake News. The false claims travel all over the internet, deceiving huge numbers into believing them. The propagators of the falsehoods receive ample profit from their false, viral  news.  And there is no accountability of the kind that would disincentivize a repeat of the behavior. (That the Post ultimately corrects its false story does not distinguish it from classic Fake News sites, which also sometimes do the same.)And while it s true that all media outlets make mistakes, and that even the most careful journalism sometimes errs, those facts do not remotely mitigate the Post s behavior here. In these cases, they did not make good faith mistakes after engaging in careful journalism. With both stories, they were reckless (at best) from the start, and the glaring deficiencies in the reporting were immediately self-evident (which is why both stories were widely attacked upon publication).As this excellent timeline by Kalev Leetaru documents, the Post did not even bother to contact the utility companies in question   the most elementary step of journalistic responsibility   until after the story was published. Intelligence officials insisting on anonymity   so as to ensure no accountability   whispered to them that this happened, and despite how significant the consequences would be, they rushed to print it with no verification at all. This is not a case of good journalism producing inaccurate reporting; it is the case of a media outlet publishing a story that it knew would produce massive benefits and consequences without the slightest due diligence or care.THE MOST IRONIC aspect of all this is that it is mainstream journalists   the very people who have become obsessed with the crusade against Fake News   who play the key role in enabling and fueling this dissemination of false stories. They do so not only by uncritically spreading them, but also by taking little or no steps to notify the public of their falsity.The Post s epic debacle this weekend regarding its electric grid fiction vividly illustrates this dynamic. As I noted on Saturday, many journalists reacted to this story the same way they do every story about Russia: They instantly click and re-tweet and share the story without the slightest critical scrutiny. That these claims are constantly based on the whispers of anonymous officials and accompanied by no evidence whatsoever gives those journalists no pause at all; any official claim that Russia and Putin are behind some global evil is instantly treated as Truth. That s a significant reason papers like the Post are incentivized to recklessly publish stories of this kind. They know they will be praised and rewarded no matter the accuracy or reliability because their Cause   the agenda   is the right one.On Friday night, immediately after the Post s story was published, one of the most dramatic pronouncements came from the New York Times s editorial writer Brent Staples, who said this:Now that this story has collapsed and been fully retracted, what has Staples done to note that this tweet was false?

3106, President Obama Says He Believes The Affordable Care Act Will Survive Trump (VIDEO),"The president says he doesn t think Obamacare is going anywhere just yet. In an interview on ABC s This Week, Obama said he doesn t think the Affordable Care Act will be fully repealed quite like Republicans hope   and millions of Americans fear.President Obama said that although there is definitely the  risk  of a full repeal, he simply doesn t think the GOP can come up with a viable replacement plan. After all, he explained with amusement, they have been trying to do so for seven full years and have always failed. But when asked directly if he thought his signature health care legislation would survive, the president said he had faith that the ACA would endure. I think it will,  he said.  It may be called something else. And as I said, I don t mind. If in fact the Republicans make some modifications,  Obama continued. Some of which I may have been seeking previously, but they wouldn t cooperate because they didn t want to make the system work, and re-label it as Trumpcare, I m fine with that. Obama said he isn t worried about having his name attached to the ACA, he is worried about the millions of Americans who depend on the legislation for their medical care. He noted all the letters he gets from real people whose lives have literally been saved because of Obamacare and said that this is what matters to him. This is his legacy, he insisted, not having his name stamped on it.Republicans are still bound and determined to repeal Obamacare and replace it with  something better.  However, as Obama points out, this isn t necessarily what the American people want. He notes that many Trump voters have said they never really believed that Donald Trump would take away their health care. Obama is hopeful that the will of the American people can keep the ACA around for a long time to come, even if it is called Trumpcare.Watch what President Obama had to say about Obamacare today, here:[ad3media campaign= 1414 ]Featured image via Ron Sachs-Pool/Getty Images",News,"January 8, 2017"
5369, President Obama Smacks Down Trump’s Bullsh*t — Claims ‘Don’t Jibe With The Facts’ (VIDEO),"Donald Trump made a lot of bullshit claims during his speech on the final night of the Republican National Convention. On Friday, President Obama fact-checked the GOP nominee and said that the fears he expressed at the RNC simply don t  jive with the facts. The president was answering questions during a press conference following a meeting with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto. He was asked about his reaction to the RNC. Obama wasn t about to let the lies and twisting of facts Trump tried to pass off as truth go unchecked.During his speech accepting the Republican nomination, Trump tried to claim that crimes rates, particularly homicides, had risen under Obama. The president took the opportunity on Monday to smack this down. Some of the fears that were expressed throughout the week just don t jive with the facts,  said President Obama.  When it comes to crime, the violent crime rate in America has been lower during my presidency than any time in the last three, four decades. And although it is true we ve seen an uptick in murders and violent crime in some cities this year, the fact of the matter is the murder rate today, the violence rate today is far lower than when Ronald Reagan was president, and lower than when I took office. Obama also noted that intentional killings of police officers are also lower than they were when Reagan was in office and when he took office.You can watch President Obama give Trump a dose of reality here:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXOOhJMZMEw]Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"July 22, 2016"

Brian Ross was suspended for a month. President Trump suggested should be fired for his #fakenews reporting.Congratulations to @ABC News for suspending Brian Ross for his horrendously inaccurate and dishonest report on the Russia, Russia, Russia Witch Hunt.

NBC picked up Kelly in a $23 million per year contract in a gamble that liberals would warm up to the formerly conservative host. NBC has since found out that conservatives no longer want anything to do with Kelly, and liberals despise her for her past performances as a top-rated host on conservative-leaning FOX News.Twitter users were on fire after Megyn Kelly did her part to help tear down President Trump (again):Megyn Kelly,You and your employer need to smear Trump but there's nothing left to accuse him of so you're going to re-interview Trump accusers who've already been proven pos liars?How desperate you must be.  Philip Schuyler (@FiveRights) December 11, 2017Today, Megyn Kelly traipsed out  a trio of Donald Trump accusers on her failing show. Rest assured, there will be many more liberal accusers who come out against Donald Trump, as racism appears to have lost its glow, as a means to draw voters into the Democrat Party, as Americans have become tired of watching Democrats constantly drawing from the bottom of the deck, as a way to cloud Trump s  Make America Great Again  agenda of a pro-growth economy, jobs, education, lower taxes, and America first.Megyn Kelly, who is desperate for ratings, must have been incredibly disappointed when breaking news of a botched suicide bomber attack in New York City was reported at the same time her Democrat Donald Trump accuser was telling her story on her show.Daily Mail A trio of the president s accusers reemerged on Monday to hound him for sexually harassing them.Samantha Holvey, Jessica Leeds and Rachel Crooks had previously made allegations against Trump and appeared on Megyn Kelly  Today  to demand justice as the White House resumed its claim that the issue had been litigated in last year s election. All of a sudden, he s all over, me, kissing and groping and groping and kissing,  said Leeds, a self-proclaimed Democrat, who says she revealed her story because  I wanted people to know what kind of a person that Trump really is what a pervert he is. This is the same Jessica Leeds that accused Trump of sexual harassment.Think Megyn Kelly will bring this picture up?Think she ll bring up the time that Jessica Leeds was in a two year property law suit with Trump? pic.twitter.com/AvdEyYu8Ew  WhiteNitemare (@Carl_Anthony215) December 11, 2017Leeds claims that Trump assaulted on a plane in the  70s and called her a  c***  when he ran into her some time later at a party in New York while he was still married to his first wife Ivana.Megyn Kelly asked former Trump accuser Jessica Leeds what she wants other women to know about sexual harassment. Leeds replied,  We have a problem in that we have been enculturated all of this time for all of this time, for years and years and years, to be compliant.  Leeds went on to say,  For the woman who voted for Trump, they just didn t want to vote for a woman   It became reasonably difficult to believe a single work Leeds had to say when she used the word enculturated  when referring to her alleged meeting with Donald Trump. It became impossible to believe a word she said when Leeds followed up her comment by exposing her bitter feelings towards women for not voting for Hillary.  The only thing missing from Leeds during her appearance on the Megyn Kelly show was her pussy hat and an  I m a committed Democrat Feminist  tattoo on her forehead.

I was so uncomfortable, and a little, yeah, threatened, like I didn t have a choice,  Crooks on Monday said.Kelly s program was preempted in New York as an explosion went off in Manhattan. Her show aired in other parts of the country, however, including Washington.Holvey, a former Miss USA contestant, said that Trump came backstage in 2006 and reviewed the women while they were indecent.She recalled thinking at the time that it would be a meet and great with Trump. But it wasn t.The former Miss North Carolina says Trump was  just looking me over like I was just a piece of meat. I was not a human being. I did not have a brain I did not have a personality. I was just simply there for his pleasure. It left me feeling very gross, very dirty, like this is not what I signed up for.

8035, Here’s What The World’s Top Economist Is Saying About Bernie Sanders,"Thomas Piketty, the French economist who started a revolution of thought on income inequality when he wrote Capital in the Twenty-First Century. He is now considered one of the world s top economists. He is now sharing his thoughts on Bernie Sanders and the movement that is driving his campaignPikkety agrees that Bernie Sanders and his supporters have the right idea when it comes to economics. Though the economist suggests that Sanders may be too  white  and too old to win an election.Other than those two caveats, Pikkety gives Bernie Sanders a glowing, if tacit, endorsement, writing that,  In many respects, we are witnessing the end of the politico-ideological cycle opened by the victory of Ronald Reagan at the 1980 elections. Conservatism in the media may have something to do with the reason Pikkety is critical of Sanders  electability with racial and other political minorities. Recent polls show the race between Sanders and Clinton is a dead heat. Polls seem to indicate that the main difference between Clinton supporters and Sanders supporters is generational.Piketty goes on to say that Sanders is reviving the progressive agenda. He writes: Sanders  success today shows that much of America is tired of rising inequality and these so-called political changes, and intends to revive both a progressive agenda and the American tradition of egalitarianism. Hillary Clinton, who fought to the left of Barack Obama in 2008 on topics such as health insurance, appears today as if she is defending the status quo, just another heiress of the Reagan-Clinton-Obama political regime.Sanders makes clear he wants to restore progressive taxation and a higher minimum wage ($15 an hour). To this he adds free healthcare and higher education in a country where inequality in access to education has reached unprecedented heights, highlighting a gulf standing between the lives of most Americans, and the soothing meritocratic speeches pronounced by the winners of the system.Meanwhile, the Republican party sinks into a hyper-nationalist, anti-immigrant and anti-Islam discourse (even though Islam isn t a great religious force in the country), and a limitless glorification of the fortune amassed by rich white people. The judges appointed under Reagan and Bush have lifted any legal limitation on the influence of private money in politics, which greatly complicates the task of candidates like Sanders. Since the oh so tragic passing of Justice Antonio Scalia, the Supreme Court may have the votes needed to end Citizen s United. That would be a major gift to future progressive candidates   Berniecrats   who would abstain from SuperPACs.The way that this election is playing out, it appears that we are witnessing a battle of generations be played out more than anything else. Regardless of who takes the nomination in this election, Sanders  supporters are very much the face of the future of the left.Featured image from Gage Skidmore [CC BY-SA 3.0], via Wikimedia Commons",News,"February 17, 2016"

3998, Harry Reid TORCHES FBI Director Comey: ‘I Believed You To Be Principled. I Now See I Was Wrong’,"Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) wrote a letter to James Comey on Sunday where he lambasted the FBI director for releasing information relating to investigating a presidential candidate just 11 days before an election. Comey has said he was obligated to tell Congress that he d found more emails, but the law may say otherwise.The Hatch Act, which prevents ICE from endorsing Donald Trump despite his repeated claims, also bars government officials from using their positions to influence the outcome of an election. Comey s, ahem, poorly timed revelation could, in fact, be seen as using his position as director of the FBI to influence this election. Reid said, point blank: I am writing to inform you that my office has determined that these actions may violate the Hatch Act. Through your partisan actions, you may have broken the law. New @SenatorReid letter to James Comey re: Hatch Act:  Through your partisan actions, you may have broken the law.  pic.twitter.com/MplVLQxgdi  Sahil Kapur (@sahilkapur) October 30, 2016Now, Comey could always reiterate that he was only doing what he promised Congress he would do. However, given that he s a Republican, he could be up to any number of things. It could be as innocent as that. Or perhaps he thinks he can restore some of his standing among his party, which took a hit after he said he wasn t filing charges against Hillary.He could also be responding to all the squeaky wheels in Congress who are bitching up one side and down the other that Hillary is guilty, is a threat to national security and is therefore unqualified to be President; and screaming and crying about Comey not doing his job.But it s the last part of Reid s letter that will really hit Comey where it hurts. Congressional Republicans tried to filibuster his nomination away, and Reid stood up for him. Reid said: Please keep in mind that I have been a supporter of yours in the past. When Republicans filibustered your nomination and delayed your confirmation longer than any previous nominee to your position, I led the fight to get you confirmed because I believed you to be a principled public servant.With deepest regret, I now see that I was wrong.

1456, Trump Shocked As New Poll Reveals The Future Of Trumpcare; It’s Worse Than You Thought (Details),"It seems only natural that Donald Trump, the lowest rated president in modern history, should have extremely unpopular policies to match how much Americans refuse to support him.Aside from his disgustingly racist travel ban, there s another policy that Americans overwhelmingly despise   the American Health Care Act, also known as Trumpcare. While it s been widely known that Americans prefer Obamacare (the Affordable Care Act) much more than Trump s shady, disastrous alternative, the real numbers prove to be worse than originally thought. It turns out, one poll states that over 75% of Americans don t want Trump s heath care plan to get anywhere near them and their loved ones.This recent poll cited that the American public s support for Trumpcare is only 23%, which basically means that Trump is screwed if he thinks he can get this health care bill to take the place of Obamacare. Almost half (48%) of Americans stated that they were against Trumpcare, with most (43%) responding that they were  strongly  opposed to it.So while Trump likes to brag about all this  winning  he s doing, we have yet to see it reflect in the American public s opinion of him and his policies. People are passionately resisting Trumpcare, and have even taken to GOP town halls to openly protest against and condemn GOP lawmakers who are trying to help Trump take out Obamacare.Trump may not want to admit it, but he s dying in the polls. It s also been reported that only 29% of Americans felt Trump was right to fire FBI Director James Comey, and 78% of the public wanted the Russia investigation to be handed off to an independent commission.The more Trump tries, the more he fails. As time goes on, we can only expect his approval rating to continue on its downward slope as he makes more horrible decisions for the country.Featured image is a screenshot",News,"May 15, 2017"

3625, Kellyanne Conway Snaps At Teen Girl Who Asked Her How She Can Work With Groper Trump,"Someone finally asked Kellyanne Conway how she can look herself in the mirror every morning and work for Donald Trump.During an event sponsored by the University of Virginia s Center for Politics, high school student Maaike Laanstra-Corn asked Conway how she can  rationalize  working for Trump even after he bragged about grabbing women  by the p*ssy  and has been hit with multiple accusations of sexual assault.Rather than just own up that she s a disgrace to the female gender and a terrible human being who sold her soul to Satan, Conway whined about the question and scolded the student instead. Women are tired of the same argument and the same thing you are presenting to me right now,  Conway claimed according to The Hill. I m glad that people looked at [those attacks] and said,  You know what? That s an argument that will not create a single job in my community, not bring back a single of the 70,000 factories that have been closed, will not deter one member of ISIS from doing their bloodletting here or anywhere else in the world. In other words, Conway completely ignored that fact that her boss is a creep who sexually assaults women and gets away with it. And then Conway scolded her for asking a legitimate question. For you to use sexual assault to try to make news here I think is unfortunate, but it also doesn t matter because Donald Trump promised he ll be a president of all Americans. Yeah,  all Americans  who aren t black, Latino, Muslim, or female.Conway had a chance to give a serious answer to a serious question. Donald Trump s treatment of women should be taken seriously, not brushed off as irrelevant.But once again, Conway defended her boss by attacking a woman, something she constantly did during the campaign whether it was Hillary Clinton or all the women who came forward with their stories of how Trump violated them.She should have trouble sleeping at night.Featured image via screenshot",News,"November 30, 2016"
11758,HOLY GLOBALIST SLAM! Nigel Farage Brilliantly DESTROYS EU Hypocrites Over Their Trashing Of President Trump [VIDEO]," It seems to me that actually with all of the anti-Trump rhetoric that is coming from everywhere actually what we re hearing is the true nature of the EU project which is genuine anti-Americanism.  Trump is motivated by protecting the United States of America from Islamic terrorism, where as what has happened in this room and in governments around Europe is that you would welcome these people into your own homes.But could we please, just for a moment look at the facts? Amongst all the hyperbole and the hysteria, all that Donald Trump has done is taken 7 countries that were identified by President Obama as posing a risk to the USA.Where were you when Obama in 2011 banned any Iraqi from going into the country for 6 months?

15854,"OBAMA’S RACISM CZAR, “REVEREND” AL SHARPTON CALLS FOR FEDERAL POLICE FORCE","Yeah putting the federal government in charge of our entire police force, sounds like a great idea Al. We re waiting for Al to call for an all black police force next you know, in the name of  fairness. Rev. Al Sharpton called for national policing legislation akin to the Civil Rights Act this morning at the kickoff his National Action Network s annual convention, just after the arrest of a white South Carolina police officer for murder in the shooting of an unarmed black man. There must be national policy and national law on policing,  Mr. Sharpton said.  We can t go from state to state, we ve got to have national law to protect people against these continued questions. Mr. Sharpton s comments, coming on the heels of multiple instances of police killings of unarmed men of color around the country, were met with applause from the crowd and from the dais, which was packed with elected officials including Mayor Bill de Blasio, Congressman Charles Rangel, Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, city Comptroller Scott Stringer and state Comptroller Thomas DiNapoliThe convention kickoff, which featured a ribbon cutting with the lawmakers, came just hours after it was announced last night that North Charleston, S.C., police officer Michael T. Slager would be charged with murder in the death of Walter Scott who can be seen in a widely publicized video running away from Mr. Slager, while the officer shoots into the man s back repeatedly. The video offers a markedly different story than the one Mr. Slager first offered up: that Scott had stolen his taser and left him in fear for his life.Mr. Sharpton praised the city s mayor and police chief for bringing the charges, but said the nation couldn t rely on the judgement of local officials. We commend them, but we cannot have a justice system that hopes we have a mayor in the right city or a police chief,  he said.  We have to have one policy that is national. Mr. Sharpton later noted that the comparatively small town s officials had been braver than police leaders in bigger cities. He has been vocal about his belief that New York City police Daniel Pantaleo should have been charged with a crime in the death of an unarmed black Staten Island man, Eric Garner. A grand jury declined to indict Mr. Pantaleo, spurring protests throughout the city.That death, too, was captured in a widely published video. And though the footage did not lead to any charges, Mr. Sharpton said today the national legislation should focus on  cameras  as well as  accountability. He compared the fight for police reform to the civil rights struggle, noting that activists did not try to fix discrimination in individual states or cities. They fought for a national Civil Rights Act, a national Voting Rights Act. It s time for this country to have national policing,  Mr. Sharpton said.After the ribbon cutting, Mr. de Blasio whose first year in office was dominated by an effort to reform police-community relations after Garner s death and a subsequent City Hall feud with police union leadership said he agreed some kind of national standard should be set. It s a broad point he s making, and I think he way he made the analogy to the Voting Rights Act is the right one. We ve got to figure out how to create the right relationship between police and community,  Mr. de Blasio told reporters.  The vast majority of police do their job well and want to work more closely with the community. Obviously community residents want to work more closely with the police. But we have to create more of a national standard that says we all have to be on the same page. The relationship between Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Sharpton was fodder for his woes with police unions last year: they took umbrage when Mr. Sharpton was seated next to the mayor and Police Commissioner Bill Bratton at a City Hall round table, and dismissed Mr. Sharpton as divisive. A poll later showed voters didn t like the approaches of either Mr. Sharpton or the union leaders and rank-and-file officers who later turned their backs on Mr. de Blasio at the funeral for two slain officers.Today, Mr. Sharpton offered a full-throated defense his relationship with the mayor, saying it was based not on political power but on a long history of working together, citing Mr. de Blasio s support on issues like wage increases and the silent march against stop, question and frisk before his election. He marched with us when other candidates wouldn t. So don t begrudge us for knowing somebody that we always knew, and that was there in the trenches with us,  Mr. Sharpton said, saying he had never asked for favors or back room deals only access and policy changes.  There s nothing in the back room we want. We want everything out front. Via: The Observer",politics,"Apr 9, 2015"
15484,OUTRAGEOUS! MEMPHIS VOTES TO DIG UP CONFEDERATE GENERAL AND WIFE,"THE CLEANSING OF OUR HISTORY CONTINUES What the heck is wrong with the city of Memphis???Late Tuesday, the Memphis, Tennessee, City Council voted unanimously to dig up the remains of Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest and his wife, Talking Points Memo reported Wednesday. The council also voted to remove a statue placed in Forrest s honor. The move came after Mayor A.C. Wharton called for the bodies to be dug up and relocated.Tuesday s vote is not the end of the story, however. According to WREG, the Chancery Court would also have to approve the removal of the remains and Forrest s family would also be involved in the decision.Forrest and his wife are currently buried beneath a statute honoring the general in a park which had been named after him until two years ago. The park is now known as Memphis  Health Sciences Park.Officials with Elmwood Cemetery   the location of Forrest s original resting place   said they would be willing to help move the remains but said they did not want to become the new home of the statue. It is not known where the statue would go if the Tennessee Historic Commission approves its removal. The commission is not set to meet before October. It is no longer politically correct to glorify someone who was a slave trader, someone who was a racist, on public property,  said City Council member Myron Lowery. WREG said Lowery spearheaded the effort to remove Forrest, his wife and the statue. The move to relocate Forrest is part of what many now see as a Stalinist effort to purge U.S. history after the tragic shooting in a Charleston, South Carolina church that left nine dead.Not everyone is celebrating the vote, however. Lee Millar, a spokesperson for the Sons of the Confederate Veterans, said the shooting proves the need for the statue to remain. I think it s disgusting that people use the shooting in Charleston and use those victims to forward their own agenda and join this anti-Confederate hysteria that s going on,  he said.  To attack something like that now I feel is just really misguided,  he added, calling the response in Memphis and other places a knee-jerk reaction.Katherine Blalock, an area resident whose great grandfather served with Forrest in the Confederate Army, agreed.  We need to have a coming together of people, not a divide and conquer,  she said.But it seems that dividing the country is exactly what some want. Not content with removing the Confederate battle flag from the national memory, some now want to see the Jefferson Memorial taken down. Retail stores have yanked the battle flag and the House has voted to forbid sales of the battle flag at National Parks. As we reported Wednesday, one former academic called the U.S. Constitution a Confederate symbol and said it should be edited.Via: examiner ",politics,"Jul 10, 2015"
4335, WATCH: Trump Makes Lame Attempt To Lecture His Fans And It Backfires HILARIOUSLY,"Wanna watch Donald Trump crash and burn in front of his own supporters?The Republican nominee held a rally in Reno, Nevada on Wednesday and took his pompousness to a whole new level by telling the crowd that they are mispronouncing the name of their state. Heroin overdoses are surging and meth overdoses in Neh-VAH-da,  Trump insultingly said.  Neh-VAH-da. When I came out here I said nobody says it the other way. It has to be Neh-VAH-da, right? Wrong. People in the crowd seemed genuinely confused and many were not happy about being lectured about how to pronounce the name of the state they live in, but that s exactly what Trump did and he was the one who was pronouncing it incorrectly. Trump even went so far as to jokingly claim that a friend of his  was killed  for pronouncing it the other way.Here s the video via YouTube.But  the other way  is exactly how it is supposed to be pronouned. It s Neh-VAD-ah, not Neh-VAH-da.Trump is hardly the first presidential candidate to make this mistake but he s the only one who did it in an insulting way while pompously lecturing the audience about how they say it wrong.And seeing as how Hillary Clinton is leading in Nevada right now it s not exactly the best time to be insulting the intelligence of Nevada residents, especially since Nevada is a battleground state that Republicans are desperate to win in November.Fox 11 anchor Ryan Kern couldn t believe what he was hearing.@realDonaldTrump tells a group of Nevadans how to pronounce their state correctly  and it s the wrong way.

The amateur president launched a war on every U.S. Intelligence agency and that won t fare well for him. Trump s war against the free press is backfiring big time, too. Perhaps Trump should stop tweeting for a moment and read Holder s warning. Nah, Trump would just tweet about Holder s wife, saying she once had blood coming out of her whatever.We re not trying to go all Alex Jones on you but for a man who typically tweets about his objections to repealing Obamacare, this does seem a bit odd.

6874, CNN Segment Turns Into A Shouting Match As ‘Apprentice’ Alums Spar Over Trump (VIDEO),"To say that Donald Trump is a divisive figure is quite the understatement. His racism, sexism, xenophobia, and all-around assholery have been on full display ever since he announced that his candidacy for the GOP 2016 presidential nomination. At this point, even former contestants from his reality show, The Apprentice, have turned against him, and are saying so publicly. Three alumi from the show appeared on CNN in a segment with host Don Lemon on Friday night, and things quickly turned ugly, because two of the former contestants, both of whom are black men, were openly criticizing the business mogul, while a contestant who is a supporter also came on and expressed his support for Trump for president.Kwame Jackson and Randal Pinkett lit into Trump at the beginning of the segment, calling out his many frightening qualities and all the reasons he d make such a terrible president. Pinkett commented on the fact that while on the show, the contestants had no clue that Trump was such a bigoted extremist, saying: We ve seen the campaign evolve from when Donald announced and talked about Mexicans as rapists and criminals to what we ve seen more recently with the violence at his campaign rallies. We ve all grown increasingly concerned that the Donald we knew when we competed is not the Donald we know as a candidate. Pinkett continued on with his criticism, saying that while Trump continues to be the same  bombastic personality  that they came to know as their host on The Apprentice, that there s a side that has come out during his presidential campaign that they were unaware of before, saying, What we didn t see was how extreme his views have evolved as he has become a political candidate. That was when Jackson joined the fray and said what all sane people have been thinking, which is that We are bordering on the precipice of fascism. Andy Dean then spoke up as a Trump supporter, and insisted that nobody in Trump s camp is responsible for the violence at the rallies. He went on to accuse the former contestants of not being appreciative of Trump s putting them on his television show. Dean then pivoted to the go-to Trump talking point, which is that The Donald is a rich, successful businessman. Jackson, countered that remark and said,  Being rich don t make you right, Andy. The thing is, Trump s supporters, be they the backwoods, ignorant types who act as if they couldn t pass an eighth grade civics class or the rich assholes like Andy Dean, seem to be completely oblivious to how dangerous Donald Trump really is. He s a racist, a sexist, a homophobe, a xenophobe, and really just an out and out fascist. That is the LAST thing this country needs, and his rise to the top is nothing short of terrifying to those of us who see what he is doing to the nation, even without so much as securing the GOP nomination.These contestants are right. Trump needs to go.

18262,MN: SOMALI MUSLIM IMMIGRANTS Explain Why It’s Acceptable To Kill Anyone Who Insults Mohammed [VIDEO],"Ami Horowitz is a thought provoking filmmaker who took a lot of heat for exposing the truth about the horrific, violent  no-go zones  in Sweden in one of his recent documentary films. Horowitz is also very controversial because he doesn t shy away from asking tough questions of the people he randomly interviews on the streets.In fiscal year 2014, Minnesota took in 2,232 refugees, according to the U.S. Office of Refugee Resettlement. Almost half of those were from Somalia.In the video below, Ami took to the streets in the Cedar Riverside neighborhood of Minneapolis, MN to talk a variety of Somali Muslim immigrants. Ami posed several questions to a large variety of random Somali Muslim immigrants. He asked young boys, teenagers, middle-aged men and even an older woman their thoughts on how they felt about living in the United States, and if they d rather living back in Somalia. Horowitz also asked if they would prefer to live under Sharia Law or American laws. Their answers may surprise you.The most shocking part of the video however, comes near the end when Horowitz begins to discuss freedom of speech in America. While one of the men being interviewed talks about how great it is to be in America and to be afforded rights like freedom of speech and freedom of religion, every single Muslim respondent believed that free speech is great unless it involves criticizing the prophet Mohammed. Horowitz took his question a step further and asked if was okay for Muslims to use violence against someone who disparaged or insulted Mohammed. Every Muslim he asked, believed that using violence, including killing a person who criticized or mocked Mohammed, would be justified.Watch:After a major dip in 2008, the year ly num bers of new So ma li refu gees in Minnesota have re bounded stead i ly.

789, Trump Campaign’s Old Tweet Comes Back To Bite Donald In The A** And It Is PERFECT,"Taking Donald Trump s erratic, unpredictable behavior into full consideration, it s safe to say that almost nothing is certain in his presidency besides his talent for humiliating the United States and incriminating himself with the help of his equally corrupt inner circle.While it s mildly entertaining (and depressing) to watch Trump melt down as his Russia scandal closes in on him, it s even more fun to see gems from the past come back to bite him in the a**.This morning, Trump had one of his Twitter tantrums, where he trashed former FBI Director James Comey. That should come as no surprise, because Trump has spent the last several months insulting the FBI and intelligence agencies because he s bitter about the Russian scandal. So it s pretty hilarious that this tweet, straight from the Trump campaign, has resurfaced:That s right   then-Trump surrogate Sarah Huckabee Sanders   who has just been promoted to White House Press Secretary due to Sean Spicer s resignation   previously trashed the very  losing  behavior that Trump has been doing for months now. Sanders had posted this in November (right before the election) in response to speculation that a few FBI agents were playing politics.We would honestly love to see Trump defend his behavior now. He s spent so much time trashing federal investigators and firing everyone who might be a threat to him in the Russia investigation, it s pretty much impossible to believe he could be innocent after all this.Trump not only fired Comey, but he has attacked the ex-FBI Director, referring to him as a  nut job  who is  not a smart guy.  Now he s threatening to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller if Mueller investigates his finances and businesses. And unfortunately, Sanders has taken a similar attitude now that she is closer to Trump. Completely forgetting about her tweet from November, she more recently stated that Comey is guilty of  atrocities. Whether she stands by it today or not, Sanders  tweet is telling in its exposure of an administration with no integrity. Trump s attacks on these prosecutors are merely a sign that he will keep losing.Featured image via Alex Wong / Getty Images",News,"July 22, 2017"
5944, Obama Shamelessly Mocks Trump: ‘Orange Is NOT The New Black’ (VIDEO),"It s no secret that President Obama has a quick wit and a great sense of humor. Both were on full display on Thursday s edition of Jimmy Fallon s The Tonight Show, and the target of said wit and humor was GOP presumptive presidential nominee Donald Trump. First, Fallon asked Obama his opinion on how the GOP felt about Trump being their nominee, and he said that the Democrats are happy about it, for sure. Then on a more serious note, the president went on to say: The truth is, actually I am worried about the Republican Party. I know that sounds   you know what it sounds like.The main role I m going to be playing in this process is to remind the American people that this is a serious job. This is not reality TV. Then the mockery resumed, this time aimed at the astoundingly stupid Republicans sitting in Congress who have made Trump their standard bearer. Obama said: Thank you, Congress, for spending eight years wishing you could replace me with a Republican. Or, to put it another way, how do you like me now? After that, the president reminded America just how much he has managed to do, how far he has pushed America in all the right directions, despite constant GOP obstruction during the entire tenure of his presidency: I m proud of the many progressive steps our country has taken in recent years, both socially and environmentally. The United States has been a leader in developing clean energy to ensure the health of our planet for future generations. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, an additional 20 million Americans now have access to quality health care, and same-sex couples across the country now have a constitutional right to marry. In short, climate change is real, health care is affordable and love is love. After that, the president got serious again for a second, and reminded us all what is at stake should Donald Trump take the White House: The American people face an important decision this fall. The entire world is watching, and they look to us for stability and leadership. I know some of the candidates have been critical of my foreign policy. I don t want to name any names, but I believe it is of the utmost importance to work alongside other world leaders. That s why I signed the Iran nuclear deal. That s why we reopened diplomatic ties with Cuba. And that s why I negotiated the new trade deal called the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP. That is when Jimmy Fallon asked President Obama his feelings on TPP, and the Commander-in-Chief did not mince words: Yeah, you know me. Look, Jimmy, the TPP allows American businesses to sell their products both at home and abroad. The more we sell abroad, the more higher paying jobs we have here at home. It s that simple. After that, things got funny again as the segment drew to a close, where Fallon asked what Obama thought of the Trump media circus. The president took a real shot at the GOP s incessant racist attacks against him, and, of course, Trump s own racism, when asked if he had been tuning in: No, but I have been watching my new favorite show,  Orange Is Not The New Black. Once again, President Obama shows himself to be a warm, down to earth, classy and adorably hilarious human being, despite being near the end of what is arguably the most difficult presidency in the history of America. He is right about Trump, and he is right to endorse Hillary Clinton in an effort to stop Trump. Most of all, though, he has not allowed anything that has been slung his way to make him lose his humanity and his sense of humor.Well done, Mr. President!

His membership with USA Swimming expired two years ago, but he could have become eligible for one again. Instead, USA Swimming hasn t just banned him, they have banned him for life.  ABC News has their statement on the issue: USA Swimming condemns the crime and actions committed by Brock Turner, and all acts of sexual misconduct. Brock Turner is not a member of USA Swimming and, should he apply, he would not be eligible for membership,  USA Swimming spokesman Scott Leightman said in a statement obtained by ABC News today.  Had he been a member, he would have been subject to the USA Swimming Code of Conduct. USA Swimming strictly prohibits and has zero tolerance for sexual misconduct, with firm Code of Conduct policies in place, and severe penalties, including a permanent ban of membership, for those who violate the Code of Conduct.' Poor little Brock Turner. Our hearts bleed pink carbonated peanut butter for him and his ruined career. His life is so difficult now, all because the drinking and partying culture on college campuses took advantage of him he decided to rape an unconscious woman. First he got thrown out of Stanford, where he was a gifted swimmer, then he got prison time, and now this. He ll have to live a mundane life devoid of the accolades he would have gotten as an Olympic medalist.Turner has promised to work to educate students about the dangers of drinking and partying on campus because he s convinced himself that s what made him rape. His father expressed for support for that when he wrote an extraordinarily disgusting defense of his son, calling him a victim of that culture, and said it s not right that his son should suffer any more just for a mere  20 minutes of action. It s painfully obvious that neither of those two actually heard the victim as she read her own statement to the court. She detailed out the horrors of finding out she d been raped, the damage it s caused, and the ways it s changed her life for the worse. She will be dealing with this for the rest of her life. Turner s defenders are trying to shun responsibility for what he did, instead of owning up to it and trying to help her in any way they can.Even a friend of his is defending him by saying that not everyone who rapes is a rapist, which is a sorry attempt to change the definition of  rapist. Furthermore, Turner only received six months in jail, and could be out in as little as three months, because Judge Aaron Persky thought his age and his lack of a criminal record up to that point warranted a mere slap on the wrist.This is the cold-blooded fuckery of rape culture at its  finest. USA Swimming is taking a stand against rape culture, though, as did Stanford when they expelled him. His life is ruined, as well it should be, because the only way to avoid this is to respect women and not rape them. Lots of men get drunk every day and manage not to rape women, so why couldn t Turner? USA Swimming did the absolute right thing.Featured image via screen capture",News,"June 11, 2016"
18073,MEDIA GOES CRAZY Over Hillary Wishing She Would Have Told Trump: “Back Up Creep!” For Standing Too Close During Debates…Remained Silent When ACTUAL CREEPS Preyed On Any Female Within Arms Reach,"The media is in an all out frenzy today, as they attempt to help pump up the sales of the horribly flawed presidential candidate and Benghazi liar, Crooked Hillary, while attempting to trash our beloved president. Does the media, or Hillary really believe we re going to buy into their latest attempt to prop up America s biggest loser s book sales, while trying to paint President Trump as some sort of  creeper ?Here are just a few of the usual suspects who jumped in with this nothing burger story in an attempt to help Hillary sell her book: Cosmopolitan, the former fashion and beauty magazine, also chimed in on the nothing burger story to show their support for the crooked female who set the woman s movement back at least 50 years: Hillary how quickly you forget about the  creepy  people you ve surrounded yourself with for most of your adult life. Do you seriously think any American will take you seriously when you call President Trump a  creep  for standing to close to you, after your husband, who s been accused of rape and sexual assault by many women, had oral sex with a 19-year old intern in the Oval Office? What about serial creeper Joe Biden, who you just can t seem to get enough of?From the Trump-hating The Hill: Hillary Clinton writes in her new book that Donald Trump s attempts to  intimidate  her during the presidential debates made her  skin crawl  and that she wanted to tell him to  back up, you creep. What would you do? Do you stay calm, keep smiling and carry on as if he weren t repeatedly invading your space?  the 2016 Democratic nominee asks in her new book,  What Happened,  excerpts of which were released by MSNBC s  Morning Joe  early Wednesday. Or do you turn, look him in the eye and say loudly and clearly  Back up, you creep. Get away from me. I know you love to intimidate women, but you can t intimidate me, so back up.   Listen to the phony Hillary read an excerpt from her new book that will likely end up where the last book did, on a bargain basement shelf at Walmart.Coming up, we'll have a Morning Joe Exclusive on Hillary Clinton's new book, and here is a first look of Clinton discussing a debate. pic.twitter.com/xRkgcoTnKw  Morning Joe (@Morning_Joe) August 23, 2017Or this Was Hillary s poor health the reason for Joe Biden s  awkward embrace while they campaigned together in Pennsylvania, or was it simply just another perfectly acceptable creeper moment from the former Vice President.",left-news,"Aug 23, 2017"
5651, Trump’s Ignorance Is Going To Turn The GOP Convention Into A World Class Clusterf*ck," In a little over two weeks, the Republican Party will hold its convention to, hypothetically, name Donald Trump as the official nominee. Conventions are usually three day long infomercials that whip up the base and kick off the tone of the campaign for the general public. They re masterpieces of propaganda with the agenda scheduled down to the minute.But that was before Donald Trump.With just a few days left before the big weekend, no one knows who is speaking, who is attending or, seriously, how much time Trump himself will spend at his own nomination:Much of the program remains in flux, including who will speak, how and when Mr. Trump will arrive, and what he will say when he does.And after months of promising that his convention would be special, and not  boring  like previous ones, Mr. Trump says he is now embracing a less-is-more approach.One thing there will be less of, which might come as a surprise to anyone expecting all the brashness and ubiquity of Trump branding, is the candidate himself.Trump is refusing to speak all three days of the convention. You know, HIS convention. Apparently he just can t be bothered. He s worried people will think he s  grandstanding.  Because Donald trump is all about moderation and humility. Said no one ever.But part of the problem, OK, MOST of the problem, is Trump himself. No one wants to be seen endorsing him and Trump literally has no idea what the hell he is doing:At one point, two aides confirmed, Mr. Trump was not even aware that the event had to be held in Cleveland, a decision made almost two years ago by the Republican National Committee.That s the kind of statement that drives Republican operatives to straight up alcoholism. Or suicide. Or both.Very few prominent Republicans have agreed to take the stage to support Trump and Trump, being the pettiest of men, has declared that he will try to block people like Ted Cruz and John Kasich from speaking unless they bend the knee to him, a most unlikely occurance.Trump is still promising to have big celebrity names at his coronation in lieu of big political names but he s become so toxic, it s hard to imagine anyone who is not already deeply ensconced in right wing culture showing up. Ted Nugent would happily get on stage to shout about guns and Muslims but his appeal is limited to inbred yokels and ammosexuals.On top of all of this, Trump still doesn t have much in the way of a campaign organization. He s just winging it and assuming his sheer awesomeness will win the day. But at this rate, his campaign, already on life support from his numerous gaffes, scandals and general idiocy, will be DOA out of the starting gate and it s not clear that Trump would be able to recover from the impending disaster his debut is shaping up to be.Featured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images",News,"July 1, 2016"

7612, Trump Made Nasty Comment About Nancy Reagan’s Looks – Can’t Go To Funeral Now,"Earlier this week after the death of Mrs. Reagan was announced, the GOP (including Trump) came out to show their full support for Ronald Reagan s spouse. It s customary, for sure   and Trump was no exception. He (of course) had nice things to say calling her:  the wife of a truly great president  and  an amazing woman. He s fighting to win the Republican nomination   he has to say these things.Yet   in a bombshell new report that was just dug up by POLITICO and obtained from the archives of columnist Liz Smith s off-the-record interview with Trump in 2004 from The University of Texas at Austin, Trump made some truly nasty comments about her. And   you can bet there s no way he can show his face at her funeral now. If he was invited, he was just uninvited.The transcript runs 68 pages long, but here are the parts of the interview that are truly damaging for Trump:Smith: I ve been invited to go to Ronald Reagan s funeral. I m debating about going.Trump: Do you like her?Smith: I did. I do like her. I think she s .Trump: You know, I respect that she was so loyal.Smith: She s, I don t think she was terribly smart. She s not a smart person.Trump: I never heard that statement that you didn t think she was that smart.Smith: I don t believe she s very smart.Trump: That s very interesting.Smith: She had really trivial .Trump: She was never very beautiful. That s for sure.Smith: No, she wasn t great. She was pretty. But not great.Why Trump thought it was necessary to comment on the former First Lady s appearance is beyond us, but her looks somehow seemed to matter. This is revealing for how Trump views women in general and their worth. Despite what he said about Mrs. Reagan, though, he had nothing but good things to say about Mr. Reagan s appearance. President Reagan, on the other hand, was truly a handsome man. Even though Trump is trying his best to invoke Ronald Reagan s name to gain influence with potential voters, it s probably important to note that Mrs. Reagan herself wasn t a fan of Donald Trump. It s been reported that one of her last words were:  Do not vote for Donald Trump.  If true, the voters aren t listening. And   it s one reason why the GOP has splintered into two and is in the disarray that it s in now.According to a nurse, identified as Althea Thoone, she said: She watched all the [GOP] debates. She was very alert and kept up with all the news and current events, especially about the election. She said no true Republican would cast a vote for Donald Trump.She was not happy at all because I don t believe she thought Donald Trump was a real Republican. She took a turn for the worse after the [11th] debate when he started talking about his private parts, and all that other nonsense about Mitt Romney getting down on his knees. So, nasty comment or not, it doesn t look like Trump would have made a very good guest at the funeral. Hillary Clinton, however, will be there. What does that tell you?Featured image via Wikimedia.",News,"March 8, 2016"
6264," REPORT: Trump And Companies Tied To Over 100 Lawsuits, Tax Evasion","Donald Trump s financials and business ventures are astronomically sketchier than Mitt Romney s. He refuses to release his tax returns, his name appears in the Panama Papers thousands of times, and now an exclusive report from USA Today shows Trump and his companies are linked to over 100 lawsuits, tax disputes and other legal limbos.An analyst from pored over thousands of documents and concluded, in summary:USA TODAY s examination of Trump s track record as a business taxpayer found not just court actions, but dozens of additional tax disputes with local authorities that didn t reach the courthouse in states including New York, Nevada, Florida and New Jersey. In some cases, Trump s businesses have disputed tax assessments; in others, they have simply not paid the tax bill until after the government took additional action.According to the information obtained from court cases, property records, and other documents showed that every year from the late 1980s to now, Trump and his associates/companies have been involved in tax disputes. Between June 2015 to now, five Trump companies in New York State alone have been issued warrants for more than $13,000 in unpaid or late taxes. Before June 2015, Trump has two other unpaid warrants; $1,580 for Trump mortgage; $1,747 for Trump University. One failed, the other is under investigation for fraud.USA Today issued a detailed list of tax issues over the decades:Not only does Trump have decades worth of tax and assessment issues stemming over three decades, he also overestimates the worth of his properties, something that might be shown in his tax returns and prove that he isn t worth as much as he says he is. For example, the Ritz Carlton Resort and Spa in Jupiter, Florida has been assessed at $13.7 million. Trump, however, personally assesses the property at $50 million, a full $36.3 million more. Then there s the famous Mar-a-Lago, Trump s personal estate in Palm Beach, Florida. Assessed at only $20 million, Trump contends that it is actually worth $50 million.Once again, records show (or don t show, because Trump won t release them) that Trump is lair, cheater, and overblows his worth to make himself look good.Trump s shady business dealings are miles long, miles deep. This is the  great businessman  Republican voters are touting when they spout their support for him.Featured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Imges",News,"May 20, 2016"
4887, Maine’s Largest Newspaper Apologizes To America For The Embarrassment Named Governor Paul LePage,"This could easily be about Donald Trump should he get elected in November, except that the whole nation would be sorry instead of just a single state.Maine already has been dealing with their own version of the Republican nominee for years now and he somehow got elected and re-elected as the Governor and the results have been nothing short of embarrassing and disastrous.So the editorial board of the Portland Press Herald, Maine s largest newspaper, apologized to the entire country on Friday expressing regret that Paul Lepage was elevated to the office he currently occupies. Dear America: Maine here. Please forgive us   we made a terrible mistake. We managed to elect and re-elect a governor who is unfit for high office. He has a gruff exterior and blunt way of talking that some of us find refreshing, but he has shown again and again that he governs by grudge, and uses his power to beat up on people who cannot fight back. The people LePage beats up on the most are African-Americans and Hispanics, whom the Tea Party governor has repeatedly blamed for crimes and drugs in the state, even going so far as to accuse them of trying to take advantage of white women in the state after they are done delivering heroin.The hate and fear mongering has caused many people to think twice before relocating to the state, whose population is getting older. This has hurt industries that are desperate for new blood to remain in operation.But LePage doesn t give a damn about that. If he could hang a  whites only  sign on the  Welcome To Maine  billboard at the state line he would do it. LePage knows that his words are widely understood to mean that he thinks that the color of their skin makes some people more likely to commit crimes, the Press Herald continues.  Rather than clarify or withdraw those statements, he repeats them.And that s exactly what Donald Trump does. Just like LePage, Trump makes toxic remarks that have drawn white supremacists to his campaign while repulsing minority voters across the country.Only now is he pretending that he wants their votes after his poll numbers have imploded.Take out LePage s name and replace it with Donald Trump s throughout the editorial and it s a perfect match.Like LePage, Trump often blames the media for his own blunders and makes offensive remarks that make him look like a jackass who should never have been on the ballot in the first place. LePage also doesn t apologize and has a thin skin.After Democratic state Rep. Drew Gattine commented about LePage s racism, the Republican governor lashed out by leaving a nasty and threatening message on his voicemail I would like to talk to you about your comments about my being a racist, you cocksucker,  LePage said.  I want to talk to you. I want you to prove that I m a racist. I ve spent my life helping black people and you little son-of-a-bitch, socialist cocksucker. You   I need you to, just friggin    I want you to record this and make it public because I am after you. Thank you. It would be nice to think that LePage would reflect on what he says and learn from these incidents, but he appears to be completely incapable of change,  the Press Herald lamented about the incident.  He will probably blame the media again for any embarrassment he suffers, but everyone has heard the tape and knows what the governor said. Unfortunately, LePage will be in office until 2019, which gives him plenty of time to do more damage and humiliate the state of Maine ever more. Somehow, that s the only  bright side  the Press Herald can think of.On the bright side, America, LePage isn t going to be governor forever, and when his successor takes office in 2019, Mainers of all political parties will have to work together to fix the damage he has done to our reputation. We hope that this person will be a leader who will welcome people of all races to live in Maine, and invest in our wonderful state.Until then, please accept our apology. We ll try not to do it again.America needs to make sure that Donald Trump does not become president. The last thing this country needs is a Paul LePage on the national level. It would be embarrassing and we would have to apologize to the entire world for all of the destruction Trump causes over the next four years assuming that he doesn t somehow get re-elected like LePage did in Maine.So let s make sure we don t have to make such an apology by making sure Hillary Clinton wins in November.Featured Image: Flickr",News,"August 26, 2016"

20588,THE TRUTH ABOUT Phony Global Warming: Why Our Snake-Oil-Salesman-In-Chief Is So Desperate To Sell Americans On This LIE," No challenge  poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change.    Obama State Of The Union speech, 2015There is a very good reason why the Left is now SHAMING anyone who doesn t believe in the phony  science  of global warming. In what amounts to essentially a money laundering scheme, the campaigns of some of the most dishonest politicians in Washington are being funded by the business owners who are hand-selected by those crooked politicians to receive billions for  global climate change  initiatives.The liberal media machine has spent decades bulldozing anyone who tells you global warming is a sham.They even came up with a clever little title    deniers. Every time a heat wave hits, every time a picture of a lone polar bear gets taken . . . the left pounds the table for environmental reform, more policy, more money to combat climate change. But how much has the world really warmed?Their message is simple: Get on the man-made global warming bandwagon . . . or you re just ignorant.But how much has the world really warmed?It s an important question, considering the U.S. government spends $22 billion a year to fight the global warming crisis (twice as much as it spends protecting our border).To put that in perspective, that is $41,856 every minute going to global warming initiatives.But that s just the tip of a gargantuan iceberg.According to Forbes columnist Larry Bell, the ripple effect of global warming initiatives actually costs Americans $1.75 trillion . . . every year.That s three times larger than the entire U.S. federal budget deficit.So, has anyone stopped to ask . . . how much has the globe actually warmed?Well, we asked, and what we found was striking.According to NASA s own data via Remote Sensing Systems(RSS), the world has warmed a mere .36 degrees Fahrenheit over the last 35 years (they started measuring the data in 1979).Hardly anything to panic about; however, that does mean the world is warmer, right?The problem with that argument is that we experienced the bulk of that warming between 1979 and 1998 . . . since then, we ve actually had temperatures DROPPING!As can be seen in this chart, we haven t seen any global warming for 17 years.Weakening the global warming argument is data showing that the North Polar ice cap is increasing in size. Recent satellite images from NASA actually reflect an increase of 43% to 63%.This is quite the opposite of what the global warming faction warned us.In 2007, while accepting his Nobel Prize for his global warming initiative, Al Gore made this striking prediction,  The North Polar ice cap is falling off a cliff. It could be completely gone in summer in as little as seven years. Seven years from now. Al Gore could not have been more wrong.However, despite this clear evidence that the temperatures are not increasing, the global warming hysteria only seems to be increasing.For example: President Obama himself tweeted on May 16, 2014:  97% of scientists agree: climate change is real, man-made and dangerous.  John Kerry, Al Gore, and a host of others have championed this statistic.Since then, it has become clear that this statistic was inaccurate.The Wall Street Journal went as far as to say,  The assertion that 97% of scientists believe that climate change is a man-made, urgent problem is a fiction.  Forbes headlined  Global Warming Alarmists Caught Doctoring  97% Consensus  Claims. Come to find out, the study President Obama was citing was botched from the start.A host of other problems for the global warming crowd are emerging, such as . . .Leaked emails from global warming scientists state that the Earth is not warming, such as this one from Kevin Trenberth that states,  The fact is that we can t account for the lack of warming at the moment and it is a travesty we can t. Claude Allegre, the founding father of the man-made global warming ethos, recently renounced his position that man has caused warming.Proof is emerging that Al Gore and even President Obama have financially benefited from fueling the global warming hysteria (click here for an internal report on this).It is becoming harder and harder for the global warming community to ignore some of the scientific data that show the Earth is not getting warmer . . . instead, the world is getting cooler.Which makes one wonder   why are we still spending $22 billion a year on global warming initiatives, and where is the money going? Global warming  has been kept on life support for another crucial reason: It has been a practical ATM for every in-the-know political figure.Al Gore, for example, has been one of the most vocally aggressive crusaders for  global warming. In 2001, before leaving office as vice president, Gore was worth less than $2 million. Since then, he has grown his wealth to $100 million . . . almost entirely by investing in a handful of  green-tech  companies . . . 14 of which received more than $2.5 billion in loans, grants, tax breaks, and more from the Obama administration.The Telegraph reports Al Gore could become the  world s first carbon billionaire  thanks to his investments in green companies . . . all of which benefit from tax dollars and government loans to  prevent global warming. And he s not alone.You are likely familiar with the story of the failed Solyndra green energy initiative, which cost taxpayers $500 million; President Obama took a lot of flak for that.But here s a little-known side of the Solyndra story I bet you haven t heard: Obama, in essence, used taxpayer money to finance his re-election campaign . . . by funneling it through Solyndra.You see, when Solyndra fell on hard times, it passed into the hands of two large private equity investors . . . Goldman Sachs and George Kaiser. When $500 million in taxpayer money was given to Solyndra, both Goldman Sachs and George Kaiser benefited. Coincidentally, both have made contributions to Obama s election campaigns adding up to roughly $1.25 million.It doesn t stop there.In 2010, another federal loan of $400 million went Abound Solar. That resulted in a bankruptcy as well. But investors in Abound Solar seemed to do just fine . . . investors like billionaire heiress Patricia Stryker. Stryker has famously contributed $500,000 to the Coalition for Progress while throwing $85,000 toward Obama s inaugural committee. It s just a coincidence that the government handed a company she invested in $400 million just before bankruptcy . . . right?There s also A123 Systems, which paid one lobbying firm $970,000 to secure money from the government   and received $279 million in federal assistance. The CEO of A123 Systems went on to fund multiple Democratic senators and contributed to Obama s campaign.First Solar received $646 million in government loan guarantees, and has since contributed more than $180,000 to Democratic campaigns.GE is notorious for spending tens of millions of dollars a year to  buy  green energy credits for its wind turbines and other green technologies   credits which helped the firm pay ZERO taxes in 2011.There are a host of other examples of liberals getting wealthy off  global warming  initiatives just like these.You can see why green energy is such a profitable business   CEOs and executives get to rake in millions of dollars, while politicians get lucrative donations for their campaigns . . . and scientists get all the funding they need to keep them going . . . all on your dime.But here s the cherry on top . . .While $22 billion of our money is being redistributed every year to greedy scientists, politicians, and corporations . . .$22 billion is just what is spent on these  global warming  initiatives.The reality is, these initiatives have ripple effects . . . mainly the regulations (from government agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency) that shackle free enterprise and force us to rely on foreign energy.According to Forbes, the total cost of these ripple effects is a staggering $1.75 trillion annually.I want you to really think about that for a moment.We re watching $1.75 trillion per year . . . $3,329,528 per minute . . . go to waste.It s worse when you note that the U.S. Energy Information Administration says these regulations could ultimately cause gasoline prices to rise 77% over baseline projections . . . send 3 million Americans to the welfare line . . . and reduce average household income by a whopping $4,000 each year.Washington knows all of this . . . and is still barreling forward with its nonsense policies!They re just letting you foot the bill, while they pocket the benefits. Climate change is no longer some far-off problem; it is happening here, it is happening now.  Fact is, organizations like the Environmental Protection Agency have handcuffed capitalism . . . based on a theory even its staunchest supporters have already renounced.The result: reduced business, higher energy and food costs, higher taxes, lost jobs, and more money going overseas.For entire story: NewsMax ",left-news,"May 12, 2016"

It was a fight between two former friends. It ultimately ended with blows being thrown,  Grand Rapids Sgt. Terry Dixon told the Press.Smith-Walker has been charged with assault with intent to do great bodily harm less than murder.***Warning***This is a violent video with graphic language.Smith-Walker smiled broadly in her police mug shot after being arrested a few miles from the mall.After Monday s brawl in which the two tussled on the hood of one car, video shows a woman who police claim is Smith-Walker get into a car across the way and pull into the street.Via: NY Daily News",politics,"Apr 9, 2015"

The stripper poles on the purple party bus are a special feature that goodness knows, every early voter requires Yesterday, the Hayride exclusively reported on gubernatorial candidate John Bel Edwards  campaign rally at the New Orleans night club known as Lyve New Orleans.Lyve New Orleans is a night club on Tulane Ave. and yesterday, the night club posted a couple of photos of their John Bel Edwards event, in which they promised a  Meet and Greet  with Edwards and a  party bus  that would take voters to go early vote.Today, the Hayride has obtained all of the videos from the night club campaign rally for Edwards, in which a party bus is seen covered in Edwards campaign signs, blaring Missy Elliot beats accompanied by strobe lights.The Edwards campaign was invited to a Family Forum yesterday to discuss social issues with his opponent Sen. David Vitter (R-LA), but skipped out on the event. Vitter, however, did attend.The videos below (caught by America Rising) show Edwards and his wife Donna Edwards meeting with voters before entering the club. Following the  meet and greet  event some of the attendees hopped on the party bus to City Hall for early voting, and the bus illegally parked in front of City Hall and had to be moved.Here s a copy of the invitation to the  rally  for John Bel Edwards for Governor of LA: Take a look at all of the footage from Edwards  campaign rally below:Here is John Bel Edwards arriving at Lyve Nite Club:Here s an inside look at the John Bel Edwards purple party bus that was apparently to be used for transporting voters to the  early voting  polls.

8808, Ted Cruz Gets OWNED By His Own Harvard Law Professor: Calls Cruz Clueless On Constitution (VIDEO),"Laurence Tribe, who was Ted Cruz s own Constitutional Law professor at Harvard, visited MSNBC s The Last Word, to discuss Cruz s total lack of understanding on, and general contempt for, the Constitution of the United States.Professor Tribe said point blank that Ted Cruz only cares about the Constitution when it benefits Ted Cruz, or if he can use it as a weapon to hurt other Americans. Otherwise, he could not care less if the Constitution says you have a right he doesn t want you to have.You really can t argue with Professor Tribe s assessment of Cruz on that. He couldn t be more correct.Professor Tribe spoke briefly to the recent  birther  attacks put forth against Cruz by fellow Republicans and Donald Trump. He said that these attacks brought into light the glaringly obvious example of how Ted Cruz simply chooses to interpret the Constitution in any way that is convenient for him at the time, with no regard to the actual law.What this does is give us a window into the character of Ted Cruz. The sort of person he is, with respect to the American Constitution. Whats intriguing   it was true even when he was my student years ago   he used to believe in  originalism,  that is the Constitution always means what it meant when it was adopted- Except when it s not convenient for him to mean that. This is a perfect example.If the Constitution always meant what he claims, namely that if you got an American mother it doesn t matter where in the world you re born, you become a natura born citizen at birth. Well then, why in the world did congress need to pass a law dealing with naturalization and immigration in 1934, saying  from now on, although it wasn t true before, if you have a mother who s an American citizen, thats good enough? Source: MSNBCTribe s example seems innocent enough, but it speaks to a larger issue where Cruz simply doesn t care about constitutional law. Remember   we were still torturing people as recently as 7 years ago, regardless of what the Constitution said. Professor Tribe continued on even further in criticizing him even further, saying the Cruz he taught constitutional law to at Harvard is nothing like the Cruz of today. He implied that it was like the Cruz of today never studied constitutional law at all. Tribe also touched on some of Cruz s other comments, where he said that the Supreme Court s word has no impact on the law of the land. Professor Tribe could only describe it as  Scary.

2637, Donald Trump Vote Broke Up This Couple’s Marriage,"The 2016 election has been particularly hard on relationships. Social media is beginning to resemble a large echo chamber, with people with diverse views unfriending each other. It s not hard to imagine that those disagreements would go beyond social media, but it s especially shocking when political differences actually end a marriage.Gayle McCormick is a retired prison guard from California. She describes herself as a  Democrat leaning toward socialist.  Her husband, though, voted for Trump, and for that, their marriage is over. It totally undid me that he could vote for Trump,  said McCormick, 73, who had not thought of leaving the conservative Republican before but felt  betrayed  by his support for Trump. I felt like I had been fooling myself,  she said.  It opened up areas between us I had not faced before. I realised how far I had gone in my life to accept things I would have never accepted when I was younger. Source: IndependentIt might seem silly to leave a 22 year marriage over a political disagreement, but this election was about much more than typical Democrat vs. Republican rancor. We aren t just talking about federal government vs. state government or the size of people s taxes. This election was largely about who we are as people. While it s clear that not everyone who voted for Trump is racist, misogynistic and xenophobic, everyone who voted for Trump doesn t see racism, misogyny and xenophobia as deal breakers.Through accusations of corruption hurled at Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump has shown himself to be far more corrupt than any Clinton could dream of. Trump has been given carte blanche to run the government like a child dictator, tweeting fantasies of revenge over every perceived slight. Donald Trump is toxic. Hell, the world is about to break up with us over Trump s election. It stands to reason that personal relationships wouldn t fare much better.Read more:Featured image via Pool/Getty Images",News,"February 7, 2017"
15044,THIS Is How Far The Left Will Go To Protect Hillary Clinton…Sick!,"Jeffrey Toobin chimes in to protect Hillary Clinton and it is in very poor taste but mostly untrue.  The reason Mr. Toobin s claim is untrue is that Amb. Stevens asked for more security 600 times! He knew the dangers but was not putting anyone at risk   it was the State Department that failed him by not adding more security!During one of the breaks in Hillary Clinton s testimony on Benghazi, Jeffrey Toobin insinuated that Ambassador Chris Stevens purposely put himself in harm s way.Stevens travelled to Benghazi from Tripoli on September 10, 2012 and planned to stay until September 14, 2012. Stevens only had two Diplomatic Security personnel with him.Committee member Rep. Lynn Westmoreland (R-Ga.) said that Stevens had asked Clinton and her State Department multiple times for extra protection. Clinton said that Stevens did not have her personal email account but had the means to call or email any relevant person at the State Department. He had the email and he had the direct line of everybody that he worked with for years. He had been posted with officials in the State Department. They had gone through difficult, challenging, dangerous assignments together. He was in constant contact with people. Yes, he and the people working for him asked for more security. Some of those requests were approved, others were not,  Clinton said.Toobin said to CNN s Wolf Blitzer that Stevens purposely put himself and the security team in dangerous situation.

The former president who the right relentlessly smeared during his time in office is seeing a surge in popularity in his post-White House life as Americans begin to realize just how good they had it. Trump has a way of clarifying things like that.In another reminder of just how popular Obama is (and by contrast, just how unpopular Trump is), a New York restaurant ground to a halt and gave the former president a standing ovation as he made his way through the seating area.

Staffers close to him tell reporters that the is consumed by a bitterness towards Obama and a seething jealousy that Obama has accomplished more than he has. It s no secret that Trump craves approval and attention   both are things that Obama has earned by his actions.

I was drinking coffee and using my computer and posting and reading lots and lots of things about Bernie Sanders like I have been doing for some time now.

As soon as I got to an internet connection again I went to look up what the fuck the stickers where for and then I found a pic of my car on their website  Not only did they vandalize my car in my opinion they were trying to use my car to promote hate. And posted to their own FB page The sticker says Warning This car is a MFZ which means a Muslim Free Zone The car owner confronted Hallinan on his Facebook page where she was mocked by the page s fans:Social media is a powerful tool that lets people come together from all over the world to share ideas.

21646,GOLDMAN SACHS CHAIRMAN THINKS UK NEEDS MORE MIGRANTS TO AVOID APPEARANCE OF RACISM…While SHOCKING NEW VIDEO Tells Another Story,"Don t worry the liberal elite always know what s best for the little people.Goldman Sachs Chairman and UN Special Representative for Migration Peter Sutherland said yesterday that Britain should take in more migrants in order to avoid creating an environment of  xenophobia and racism .Shocking footage filmed in the French port town of Calais shows desperate migrants attempting to break into delivery trucks heading to the United Kingdom in another illustration of how the country s generous welfare system acts as a beacon for illegal aliens.The clip shows huge gangs of migrants roaming around on a highway attempting to attack vehicles.Police or immigration authorities are nowhere to be seen as migrants rip open the back door of a truck before attempting to pull down its contents to make their way inside, while others try to pull off an underside panel.A tour guide on the bus from where the footage is being filmed tells passengers,  Don t panic guys, we have locked all of the doors. Try not to panic guys. Passengers are heard gasping in shock, with one commenting,  This is what we ve seen on TV. The migrants are keen to reach the UK because they can exploit the country s generous welfare system and obtain a much higher standard of living than in France, where they are forced to reside in a makeshift tent village in Calais known as  the jungle .Around 2,500 migrants live in the tent village, with most of them coming from Sudan, Eritrea, Libya and Syria.The situation is so dire that a leading haulage group warned earlier this month that freight carriers could suspend supplies going through Calais altogether, causing food shortages and massive price hikes.Donald Armour, International Affairs Manager at the Freight Transport Association, told the Daily Express that the UK supply chain is  in danger of collapsing  as a result of drivers refusing to go through Calais.Last month, Maru International haulage company announced that they were boycotting Calais over fears that  somebody will be killed  by migrants attempting to enter the UK.Via: Info Wars ",left-news,"Jun 15, 2015"

Their aim is to pass bigoted laws that make simple things like using the bathroom as difficult as possible.The far-right religious zealots who control legislatures in states like Texas want you to believe there s some kind of connection between the LGBT community and pedophilia.

14948,#WarOnChristmas: Starbucks Attempts To Capitalize On Christmas By Erasing Any Sign Of Christmas From “Red Cup”,"War on Christmas update: Some very clever people are asking you to join their campaign to remind Starbucks and their customers that Christmas is more than a red holiday!Social media has seized on the year-on-year stripping of Christmas-themed symbols from Starbucks  famous  Red Cups , with angry users tweeting #MerryChristmasStarbucks following a Breitbart London report on the company s  War on Christmas .When the coffee chain launched their 2015 seasonal cup design there was a marked difference from prior years, with no actual decoration being offered on the 2015 cups. The #RedCups press release described the cups as a  more open way to usher in the holiday. Breitbart London editor-in-chief Raheem Kassam broke the story last week, with CNN, the Huffington Post, the Telegraph, TIME magazine and others all following Breitbart s lead on the story of Christmas being eroded from the annually marketed Starbucks Christmas cups or  Red Cups. Members of the British Parliament, as well as Christian charities spoke out against the move, with Sir David Amess MP telling Breitbart London:  This is utter madness. Who was the idiot who thought this up? He should be sacked! Prior years have brandished illustrations from Christmas ornaments over evergreen tree branches to merry carolers and reindeer. Other years have been less obviously Christmas, but this year s offering bears zero illustrative reference to the Christmas season.Several stories have followed pondering the cultural  war on Christmas  and whether this year s Starbucks seasonal cups are indicative of a greater cultural cleansing of Christmas in the West.Some coffee shops haven t forgotten to remember Christmas is the reason we celebrate this season:#MerryChristmasStarbucks (from @DunkinDonuts this morning) pic.twitter.com/4I7IsDM5TQ  Michael Graham (@IAMMGraham) November 9, 2015Social media commenters indicated their disappointment with the naked design.

Sure.

Both those attempting to re-infuse Christmas into the season and those who refuse the idea of a cultural  war on Christmas  to those that just think the new design is simply  boring  have utilised the hashtag.Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz is no stranger to controversy and political correctness. One example is the company engaging in efforts to legalize homosexual marriage. In the wake of a boycott from a pro-traditional marriage group Schultz lashed back. At a shareholder s meeting in March 2013, Schultz proclaimed that a shareholder concerned with effects of the political endeavors on earnings could sell their shares.

Unfortunately, though, it has been confirmed that these people have no intention of going anywhere. In fact, one of the militants, LaVoy Finicum, says they have a right to be there, even if the local residents want them to leave.Finicum said to the press that he knows that the people who actually live in the area want the militia to get out of dodge, and a third says we like what you re doing but not liking your method, appreciate it but we want you to go, and about a third saying don t go, stay.  However, the United States is a republic, so they aren t going anywhere. He went on to say: Let s talk about a republic. It s the right of an individual that we re looking at, not the right of the collective. You know if there is just one rancher that is saying please help me, please don t go, what about him?

3173, Jewish Family’s Hanukkah Destroyed By Vandalism; Trump Supporters Make It Worse (IMAGE),"A Chandler, Arizona family awoke early one morning to see that the Menorah sculpture on their lawn had been vandalized and turned into a swastika. Clearly, this was bad enough for the Jewish family, but when Fox 10 Phoenix posted the picture, things got really ugly. Not surprisingly, Donald Trump s name was mentioned a lot.[It takes]  A very ignorant, shallow person, a coward,  said Gary Guadagnino, who has lived in the neighborhood for more than two decades. The Menorah decoration belonged to her neighbor, Naomi, and her husband.According to Naomi, she and her husband built the religious symbol two years ago, and it was brought back by popular demand. Naomi said her family has no idea why someone would do this, especially in their accepting, welcoming community. Someone full of a lot of hate and prejudice would do it,  said Naomi.  I can t imagine that someone from this community or this neighborhood would do something like that. Facebook users weren t as sympathetic as the neighbors. Some thought the Holocaust symbol was amusing:Others blamed liberals and people who didn t vote for Trump:Others blamed the homeowners:Some, like this guy with a Confederate flag, thought the swastika was no big deal:The United Nations did it? Really?John Kerry even got the blame:And there were some proud Nazis saying that the Jewish family brought it on themselves for being Jewish.This guy hates Jews too:This voice of sanity got absolutely zero likes:Part of the blame for this belongs with the conservative media, who has been jumping on a few faked hate crimes to try to delegitimize true hate crimes, and trust me, there s been no shortage.As the comments show, racists and antisemitics feel empowered now, and for that we can blame Donald Trump. While the right-wing media is pointing to 10 or maybe 17 instances of faked hate crimes, the Southern Poverty Law Center has collected more than 1,000 incidents of hate crimes, just since the election. 108 of those have included a swastika and 33 have been anti-semitic. These weren t done by liberals or by people who voted for Hillary Clinton. Donald Trump brought this on.Featured image via screen capture from embedded Facebook post",News,"January 3, 2017"
1494, Trump Didn’t Have The Backbone To Fire James Comey Himself; Here’s The Former Bodyguard He Chose To Do It For Him,"President Donald Trump may be known for his catchphrase of  You re fired!  on the reality-TV series The Apprentice, but they don t seem to be the type of words he likes to utter in every day life. That s one of several reasons why Trump left it to his former bodyguard, Keith Schiller, to deliver the news to newly-ousted FBI Directer James Comey. So who is Keith Schiller?Schiller, one of the president s most trusted aides, has taken a step up in the world since Trump s election victory, earning himself the title of Director of Oval Office Operations after almost two decades of watching Trump s back. According to Corey Lewandowski, Trump s former campaign manager,  The president has exceptional confidence in Keith. If he asks him to do something, he knows it will get done. Schiller first encountered the Trump clan when he was working as a New York City police detective and spotted Marla Maples, Trump s second wife, in the Manhattan prosecutor s office back in 1999; Schiller was there for a meeting with Maples, who was reporting a theft by an employee. Not long after he sat down, a man pulled up a seat and introduced himself to Schiller as Trump s current bodyguard. I looked at him, totally not impressed by his stature, physical stature,  Schiller recalled in 2015 in a rare videotaped interview.  A light goes off. I said:  Bodyguard, I can do this  . . . I m no stranger to putting my hands on people. His mind was made up and Schiller reached out to Trump, landing a part-time position as a bodyguard. After retiring from the police department in 2004, Schiller began working for Trump full-time, now as the Trump Organization s director of security, a role which involved following Trump on the road during his campaign trail from that point, even providing an extra layer of security after the Secret Service took over.Schiller rarely gives interviews, but that hasn t stopped those around him from doing so and Michael Caputo, a political adviser who worked with Trump between 2013 and 2016, probably summed up best what Schiller means to the Trump organization.  Keith Schiller is not just some bodyguard,  says Caputo.  Nobody knows the score among the advisers better than Keith Schiller.  . . . Keith s always known what s what among the people who are in Donald Trump s orbit. Never was that level of trust on clearer display than in April when Trump s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, traveled to Iraq. Despite the fact that Iraq specialist that would usually be present didn t participate after being told there was no room for them on the plane, Schiller was given a seat at the table during talks with members of the Iraqi government and appeared in official group photographs during the trip.Before becoming a member of Trump s elite inner circle, Schiller was renowned among his NYPD colleagues for his size and strength.  He was strong as an ox,  said David Chong, who served as Schiller s boss for eight years on a New York City police task force on high-intensity drug-trafficking areas. In fact, on some raids, Chong claims that Schiller would volunteer to carry the 60-pound battering ram, anticipating breaking in the door when he reached the top of the stairs.Schiller was also Trump s right-hand man during a WWE event, stepping briefly into the spotlight after Trump  slapped  World Wrestling Entertainment chief Vince McMahon in the center of the ring. As part of the bit, McMahon charged Trump, only to be stopped and repeatedly pushed back by Schiller before finally getting thrown to the ground by Donald Trump s head goon.Naturally, anyone associated with the Trump organization isn t going to be without their controversies and Keith Schiller has more than his fair share. For example, in September 2015 during Trump s campaign, Schiller took a sign from a protester. Unexpectedly, the protester, Efrain Galicia, lunged at Schiller but only received a punch in the face for his efforts, however, Galicia and other protesters are currently attempting to sue. During his testimony, Schiller acknowledged that at the time of the incident, he did not hold a valid New York state security guard license. On another occasion several days earlier, Schiller forcefully removed Univision anchor Jorge Ramos from a Trump campaign news conference for repeatedly asking questions about immigration.All things considered, it comes as no surprise that Donald Trump didn t fire the towering James Comey himself on Tuesday, opting for Keith Schiller over even a more junior staffer. Why would he when he has this type of hired muscle sitting at a desk a few feet away?Featured image by Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,"May 12, 2017"
4703, Sen. Tim Scott: Running A Small Business Makes Me An Authority On Abortion (VIDEO),"The 2016 Values Voter Summit is underway, and of course this yearly gathering of homophobes, misogynists, science deniers, and other assorted right-wing nuts is especially feverish since this is an election year. At the top of the list of priorities for such people, is, of course, abortion.These people hate the idea of a woman being able to control her own body. They think that a bunch of men in the government should have that authority, not a woman and her doctor. However, one GOP Senator who spoke at this horrible event really had the most absurd argument ever to make the case that he is somehow more qualified than anyone else to legislate on abortion: because he ran a small business before he was a member of Congress.South Carolina Senator Tim Scott said, with the air of a father finding out that his teen daughter has come home pregnant, that an employee told him that she was pregnant. So what did Sen. Scott do with this woman? Why, what any manipulative Christian who wants to control the lives of others would do: took her to a crisis pregnancy center.Crisis pregnancy centers are nothing but right-wing Christian organizations that lie about a woman s choices when it comes to dealing with an unwanted pregnancy. They manipulate young girls and women into believing that abortion is absolutely not an option, for any reason. And, of course, these are the same people who are opposed to any sorts of help for the mothers and children once they are born.Senator Scott said of the conclusion of his decision to  help  this woman in this way, and how it makes him especially qualified to opine and legislate on this matter: As an elected official, when I have the responsibility and the opportunity, the privilege to protect life, I do so having been in the private sector, realizing the importance that we should place on life and the choice of life. Senator Scott, you aren t  protecting  anything. You re just trying to control the bodies of women around the nation who you don t even know. Plus, you ll likely, like all GOPers, abandon these fetuses the second they are out of the womb. You people and your sick obsession with controlling women need to be voted out. As a South Carolinian, I plan to do just that.Watch Tim Scott s crazy unfold below:Featured image via Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images",News,"September 9, 2016"
21485,BRILLIANT: [VIDEO] SHERIFF CLARKE EXPLAINS HOW #BlackLIESMatter IS BASTARD CHILD OF #HandsUpDontShoot LIE,"Nothing like a good dose of Sheriff Clarke to expose the lies of the left  After showing a clip of the confrontation between Hillary Clinton and some  Black Lives Matter  representatives in which things became tense and Clinton was clearly uncomfortable, Sheriff David Clarke is asked to weigh in on what is happening.He leads off by saying,  Hillary meet Frankenstein, they created this monster and now they realize that if you cannot continue to feed it the beast the beast will turn on you and eat you and that s what s going on here. He said that he refers to the group as Black Lies Matter because they are perpetuating lies built upon a foundation of lies, the  bastard child  of the original lie of the  Hands Up Don t Shoot  narrative built upon the justified self-defense shooting of hood rat Michael Brown.Sheriff Clarke describes the group as  a conglomeration of misfits,  noting their ranks include retreads and operatives from the occupy movement, organized labor, criminals, black racialists, cop haters and anarchists. He fails to include their funding source, billionaire America-hater George Soros. Any Marxist associated or otherwise subversive movement in this nation invariably has the stain of Soros visible just below the surface.Sheriff Clarke says,  No longer in the United States, and I think that I m living proof of that, no longer can blacks as a whole claim victim status except for one situation. They are victims to the Democrat Party in the United States of America and what modern liberalism has done to the black family. The speak to the absurdity of Democrat candidate for president Martin O Malley caving to  Black Lives Matter  pressure to walk back a statement that all lives matter.Clarke says  It s an example of the monster that they ve created that they cannot feed anymore. They re not in control of this movement. This was created to mobilize the black vote for the 2016 election. The problem is we ve got a long way to go and there s only so long that you can keep that sort of negative movement going before you lose control of it. I though O Malley, his reaction after that was pathetic. They point to how well the cowering to the black thugs has demonstrated the lack of character on the part of both O Malley and Barry  Surrender the mic  Sanders and their unfitness for the world leadership stage.They also note the hypocrisy of the faux-movement in that only the black lives which they can use to foment unrest matter. The black on black violence is never mentioned and it doesn t matter because it carries with it no political capital. Via: Rick Wells",left-news,"Aug 23, 2015"
3136, Twitter Blasts Trump’s Ego To BITS After He Attacks His Own Show For Being Terrible (TWEETS),"On Friday, Donald Trump decided to distract from revelations that intelligence agencies had identified the individual Russians who delivered hacked documents to Wikileaks on behalf of The Donald s  best friend  Vladimir Putin by proving to the world that what he lacks in his desire to attend intelligence briefings he makes up for in his adherence to the principle that  ratings aree everything.

So sad  pic.twitter.com/GvTCs9fL7w  Subvert Trump (@_Robespierre__) January 6, 2017Trump may be tweeting about ratings, but he surely has a lot on his mind with the intelligence briefing. After all, he has maintained for months that he had secret information that proves Vladimir Putin s gang didn t hack his political enemies for him. He has repeatedly attacked our intelligence agencies for bringing it to light. As ABC reports, the proof that Trump was lying to the American people is quite strong:Overnight   just hours after President Barack Obama received the report   new details emerged of just what is contained in the secret document.A senior official briefed on the intelligence sources, methods and assessments in the report that Trump will receive this morning told ABC News that the findings are clear: the evidence points directly to the Kremlin and to Russian President Vladimir Putin in what one official described as  multiple streams and types of intelligence collection, not just forensic examinations of the hacked systems.  Those various streams of information gathered by U.S. spy agencies include signals intelligence such as intercepts of communications between Russian officials in which they implicated the Kremlin s own espionage, as ABC News reported last month.The Washington Post reported late on Thursday that the eavesdropping caught senior Russian officials actually cheering Trump s surprise victory in November as a success of the Kremlin s intelligence program.And Vice President Joe Biden   who was privy to the classified briefing that Trump will receive today   told the PBS NewsHour that,  there s overwhelming consensus in the community and overwhelming evidence supplied by the community that Russia did engage in an effort to impact on the elections. There is clear evidence that they in fact were engaged in activities designed to try and impact in the outcome of the election,  Biden said, while noting there was  no evidence that they actually tampered with voting booths or tampered with voting rolls. Referring to parts of the report which will be made public next week, Biden said:  It will state clearly that the Russians did as a matter of policy  attempt to  discredit the US electoral process  and  attempt to hurt Mrs. Clinton. Contrary to Trump s public bloviations Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, says that the attacks were approved at the highest level of government in Russia    and by that, he means that  the highest is President Putin. Recently, Barack Obama expelled more than 30 suspected Russian intelligence operatives from the country. Vladimir Putin responded by saying he would wait to respond until his puppet   sorry, Trump   was officially President.Featured image via Getty Images (Andrew Renneisen)/screengrab",News,"January 6, 2017"
21555,BENGHAZI SPOKESLIAR SUSAN RICE TELLS CNN: ‘We should expect’ Iran To Use Funds It Gets For Terrorist Operations [VIDEO],"Tell us Susan what s worse, Iran with a nuclear weapon and billions of dollars to help fund muslim terrorists or Iran with a nuclear weapon and frozen assets? President Obama s National Security Advisor, Susan Rice, told CNN s Wolf Blitzer on Wednesday that  we should expect  Iran to use the money it gets under sanctions relief for military and even terrorist operations.As part of Obama s nuclear agreement with Iran, tens of billions of dollars frozen as part of the sanctions on Iran will be released over time   provided Iran complies with a list of deadlines outlined in the agreement. What do we think they ll spend that money on? We think, for the most part, they re going to need to spend it on the Iranian people and their economy which has tanked,  she told Blitzer.Of course, murderous regimes like Iran don t generally limit themselves to domestic infrastructure projects and welfare schemes, which Rice quickly acknowledged. But yes, it is real, it is possible, and, in fact, we should expect that some portion of that money would go to the Iranian military and could potentially be used for the kinds of bad behavior that we have seen in the region up until now,  she said.By  bad behavior  Rice is presumably referring to Iran s funding of terrorist organizations, and its expanding military operations throughout areas such as Yemen.Despite the fact that the Obama administration fully expects Iran to use its newly released billions to fund terrorism, Rice told Blitzer those concerns didn t play an important role in negotiations. The goal here, Wolf, was never, and was not designed to prevent them from engaging in bad behavior in the region. They re doing that today,  she said.  The goal is to ensure that they don t have a nuclear weapon, and therefore, when they are engaging in that bad behavior, are that much more dangerous. Rice s acknowledgement of Iran s bad faith might not bother the administration, but it is likely to cause a little concern in congress.After all, Iran s  bad behavior  is a pretty good indication that the murderous regime in Tehran has no intention of cleaning up its act   which makes it somewhat hard to trust they will abide by an Obama sponsored agreement.Via: BizPacReview",left-news,"Jul 17, 2015"
9114,"WHY THIS BLUE-COLLAR DEMOCRAT STRONGHOLD County Is Still Fighting For Trump: “He was the hope we were all waiting on, the guy riding up on the white horse” [VIDEO]","AP News  The regulars amble in before dawn and claim their usual table, the one next to an old box television playing the news on mute.Steven Whitt fires up the coffee pot and flips on the fluorescent sign in the window of the Frosty Freeze, his diner that looks and sounds and smells about the same as it did when it opened a half-century ago. Coffee is 50 cents a cup, refills 25 cents. The pot sits on the counter, and payment is based on the honor system.People like it that way, he thinks. It reminds them of a time before the world seemed to stray away from them, when coal was king and the values of the nation seemed the same as the values here, in God s Country, in this small county isolated in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains.Everyone in town comes to his diner for nostalgia and homestyle cooking. And, recently, news reporters come from all over the world to puzzle over politics   because Elliott County, a blue-collar union stronghold, voted for the Democrat in each and every presidential election for its 147-year existence.Until Donald Trump came along and promised to wind back the clock. He was the hope we were all waiting on, the guy riding up on the white horse. There was a new energy about everybody here,  says Whitt. I still see it. Despite the president s dismal approval ratings and lethargic legislative achievements, he remains profoundly popular here in these mountains, a region so badly battered by the collapse of the coal industry it became the symbolic heart of Trump s white working-class base.The frenetic churn of the national news, the ceaseless Twitter taunts, the daily declarations of outrage scroll soundlessly across the bottom of the diner s television screen, rarely registering. When they do, Trump doesn t shoulder the blame   because the allegiance of those here is as emotional as it is economic.It means God, guns, patriotism, saying  Merry Christmas  and not Happy Holidays. It means validation of their indignation about a changing nation: gay marriage and immigration and factories moving overseas. It means tearing down the political system that neglected them again and again in favor of the big cities that feel a world away.On those counts, they believe Trump has delivered, even if his promised blue-collar renaissance has not yet materialized. He s punching at all the people who let them down for so long   the presidential embodiment of their own discontent. He s already done enough to get my vote again, without a doubt, no question,  Wes Lewis, a retired pipefitter and one of Whitt s regulars, declares as he deals the day s first hand of cards.He thinks the mines and the factories will soon roar back to life, and if they don t, he believes they would have if Democrats and Republicans and the media   all  crooked as a barrel of fishhooks    had gotten out of the way. What Lewis has now that he didn t have before Trump is a belief that his president is pulling for people like him. One thing I hear in here a lot is that nobody s gonna push him into a corner,  says Whitt, 35.  He s a fighter. I think they like the bluntness of it. He plops down at an empty table next to the card game, drops a stack of mail onto his lap and begins flipping through the envelopes. Bill, bill, bill,  he reports to his wife, Chesla, who has arrived to relieve him at the restaurant they run together. He needs to run home and change of out his Frosty Freeze uniform, the first of several work ensembles he wears each day, and put on his second, a suit and tie. He also owns a local funeral home and he s the county coroner, elected as a Democrat.The Whitts, like many people here, cobble together a living with a couple jobs each   sometimes working 12 or 15 hours a day   because there aren t many options better than minimum wage. There s the school system, and a prison, and that s pretty much it. Outside of town, population 622, roads wind past rolling farms that used to grow tobacco before that industry crumbled too, then up into the hills of Appalachia, with its spectacular natural beauty and grinding poverty that has come to define this region in the American imagination.Whitt slides a medical bill across the table. Looks like this one is the new helmet,  he says, and his wife tears the envelope open and reports the debt: $3,995. They will add it to a growing pile that s already surpassed $40,000 since their son was born nine months ago with a rare condition. His skull was shaped like an egg, the bones fused together in places they shouldn t be. Tommy, their baby boy with big blue eyes, has now outgrown three of the helmets he s been required to wear after surgery so his bones grow back together like they should.They pay $800 a month for insurance. But when they took their baby to a surgeon in Cincinnati, they learned it was out of network. In-network hospitals offered only more invasive surgeries, so they opted to pay out of pocket. At the hospital they were told that if they d been on an insurance program for the poor, it would have all been free.This represents the cracks in America s institutions that drove Whitt, a lifelong Democrat, from supporting President Barack Obama to buying a  Make America Great Again  cap that he still keeps on top of the hutch. Many of their welfare-dependent neighbors, he believes, stay trapped in a cycle of handouts and poverty while hardworking taxpayers like him and his wife are stuck with the tab and can t get ahead. Where s the fairness in that?  he asks.But Whitt doesn t blame Trump for the failure this year to repeal the health care law and replace it with something better. He blames the  brick wall  in Washington, the politicians he sees as blocking everything Trump proposes while  small people  like them in small places like this are left again to languish.A third of people here live in poverty. Just 9 percent of adults have a college degree, but they always made up for that with backbreaking labor that workers traveled dozens of miles to neighboring counties or states to do, and those jobs have gotten harder to find.Many here blame global trade agreements and the  war on coal    environmental regulations designed by Obama s administration to curb carbon emissions   for the decline of mining and manufacturing jobs. When Trump bemoans the  American carnage  of lost factories and lost faith, it feels like he s talking to the people in these Appalachian hills. When he scraps dozens of regulations to the horror of environmentalists and says it means jobs are on the way, they embrace him.Coal has ticked up since Trump took office; mining companies have added 1,200 jobs across the country since his inauguration, more than 180 of them in Kentucky. But industry analysts say that was tied largely to market forces and dismiss Trump s repeated pledges to resuscitate the coal industry as pie in the sky. Coal has been on the decline for many decades for many reasons outside of regulation: far cheaper natural gas, mechanization, thinning Appalachian seams. With the opposition he s had, I think he s pulling the plow pretty good,  offers Wes Lewis from the card table. A few months ago, he says, he saw four brand-new coal rigs going through town.  For the longest time, under Obama, all we saw were trucks being pulled on wreckers, because people turned belly up, they went broke. Lewis says he s heard about friends of friends being called back to work. He s noticed new trucks in people s driveways, too, which he takes as evidence that his neighbors are feeling confident about their futures. These tiny signs stack up to him as proof. Lewis fishes the tag out of the bib of his overalls:  Made in Mexico,  it reads. Trump s bringing them back,  he says.Lewis, a registered Democrat, trusts Trump because he trusts his values. And because of that, he trusts Trump s other promises   so strongly he can t think of anything that would shake that faith in him. If the factories and mines don t come back, he ll blame the opposition. If there isn t a wall on the Mexico border, he says, it won t be because Trump didn t try. If investigators find his campaign colluded with Russians, it s because so many people are so determined to bring him down.Go HERE to read entire story.",politics,"Dec 27, 2017"

21183,SYRIAN DROPS TRUTH BOMB: Germany Asked “Refugees” [On Internet] To Come…”None of us had to flee…we didn’t want to go to the army…easier to get a good job and earn money in Europe”,"This is what happens when you have government leaders who represent their own self interests, putting job opportunities and national security for its citizens dead last. Sound familiar?A well-known Iranian born writer, Ramin Peymani explains in a Huffington Post- Germany article,  Der Syrer   eine Fl chtlingsgeschichte  ( The Syrians, A Refugee Story ), that, while living in Germany, he met up with the Syrian refugee in the checkout line at a local grocery store.Being Iranian, Peymani could speak fluently with the  refugee,  who freely admitted that he, and all the others claiming to be refugees, were not fleeing war, but had merely come in search of jobs and money.The Syrian told Peymani that his mother lived in America, that that his sister was still in Syria. Did you escape with your mother? Why your sister has not come?  Peymani asked. No, I did not flee. None of us had to flee,  the Syrian freely admitted. The Assad regime is cruel and unjust, but you can live in Syria, if you just don t mess with it. Peymani then asked if the Syrian had then fled from the Islamic State terrorists. The Syrian s answer in this regard was revealing as well: I come from Damascus, like most of us [refugees] do that I ve met in the camp. There is no IS [in Damascus]; it is in other regions, for example, towards Iraq. Peymani then asked him the logical next question:  Are you saying that most Syrians do not flee from war and persecution? The Syrian answered:  Yes. My friends and I went because we didn t want to go to the army. And because it is easier to get a good job and earn money in Europe. Peymani then wanted to know why so many Syrians had come so suddenly.  Why now are so many coming? Is it because the Assad regime has become worse? The Syrian replied:  No. He [Assad] has been in power many years already. The regime is cruel and can kill opponents, but my family and I have not been touched, and none of my friends either. So why had they all now come to Europe, Peymani asked, to which the Syrian replied: In the summer we saw on the Internet that Germany wanted people to live there. We were invited to come here. And it was said that the state would take care of us and we would be given jobs. But I cannot find one Peymani also asked him what route he had followed to Germany. I lived in Turkey for some time after my mother had emigrated to the United States to be with relatives. But I could not get a visa for the USA, even though my mother has a green card. Peymani asked him if he had  fled  to Turkey  because of the war in Syria? Laughing, the Syrian replied:  No (laughs). My friends and I are here because we thought we d find work. We did not like Turkey. He was then asked if his  story is typical of the people who leave Syria? The Syrian replied:  I think most go for the same reason as I did. All men of my age, who want to just live better elsewhere. ",left-news,"Dec 29, 2015"

6016, NC Students Pull Racist Prank On Their Classmates That’s Straight Out Of Trump’s Book,"Students at a North Carolina high school have let Donald Trump s influence get to them way too much. Last week, they built a wall of boxes that blocked off McDowell High School s common area, and then put the photo on Instagram, saying,  We built the wall first,  in apparent homage to Donald Trump and his border wall idea.Worse, they built this wall under the supervision of a teacher. Of all people, a teacher should have known what this symbolized and discouraged the students from doing this. Instead, these students got supervision for a racist prank that understandably upset their Latino classmates.They wanted to put a Trump sticker on it, too, but at least someone had the guts to tell them they couldn t do that. A picture of the wall was shared on Students4Trump s Instagram account, and is below:McDowell High School students get the award for best #studentsfortrump senior prank. THEY BUILT A WALL!!

They burned the American flag and laughed at police  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 4, 2016One has to wonder how he knows that. Chances are, he doesn t, and just assumes that any Latinos who don t support him are here illegally.These kids took a page straight out of his book to do this, and they know it. Otherwise they wouldn t have wanted to put a Trump sticker on it. The students aren t going to face any disciplinary action over it, either, likely because it was just a  prank.  That tells them that racist behavior will be tolerated in our society and teaches them nothing of value.Trump would be so proud of these kids. That s sickening.Featured image by Elijah Nouvelage/Getty Images",News,"June 5, 2016"
19893,"HILLARY SUPPORTERS Launch VILE ATTACK On Woman Hillary “Threatened” For Coming Forward With Rape Allegations Against Bill Clinton: “Hillary should have beat her up, not ‘silenced’ her. Liar”","Alleged Bill Clinton sexual victim Juanita Broderick hit back after Chelsea Clinton complained that her parents were always being  attacked  and is some sort of  tradition.  Her parents being attacked is a tradition? What about your father s victims of sexual assault? Is that some sort of tradition?Following the debate, Trump told the press that he was holding back on bringing up Bill Clinton s sexual predator history out of respect for Chelsea being in the audience.Chelsea, who apparently is okay with her father receiving oral sex in the Oval Office, and her mother berating and threatening his alleged sexual abuse victims, had this to say about Trump: It s a distraction from his inability to talk about what s actually at stake in this election and to offer concrete, comprehensive proposals about the economy, or our public school system, or debt-free college, or keeping our country safe and Americans safe here at home and around the world. And candidly, I don t remember a time in my life when my parents and my family weren t being attacked, and so it just sort of seems to be in that tradition, unfortunately.

19665,HEY VOTERS…IT’S NOT OVER! Pay-To-Play Hillary And Her “Non-Profit” Foundation Are STILL Under FBI Investigation,"Republican National Committee (RNC) Chairman Reince Priebus reacted to FBI Director James Comey s letter on Sunday informing Congress the agency will not change its previous decision to not recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton in the e-mail probe.Priebus released the following statement reminding voters the FBI continues to investigate the Clinton Foundation: The FBI s findings from its criminal investigation of Hillary Clinton s secret email server were a damning and unprecedented indictment of her judgment. The FBI found evidence Clinton broke the law, that she placed highly classified national security information at risk and repeatedly lied to the American people about her reckless conduct. None of this changes the fact that the FBI continues to investigate the Clinton Foundation for corruption involving her tenure as secretary of state. Hillary Clinton should never be president. Last week, Fox News cited two sources with intimate knowledge of the FBI s investigations as saying the agency s probes into the Clinton Foundation continue to be a  very high priority  among local agents on the ground.Fox News further reported:Agents have interviewed and re-interviewed multiple people on the foundation case, which is looking into possible pay for play interaction between then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation. The FBI s White Collar Crime Division is handling the investigation.There is a split, however, between local investigators and FBI headquarters, as well as with the Justice Department.Here is the full text of Comey s letter on Sunday informing lawmakers of the FBI s decision to not alter the agency s conclusion reached last July that it will not recommend charges against Clinton in the email case:I write to supplement my October 28, 2016 letter that notified you the FBI would be taking additional investigative steps with respect to former Secretary of State Clinton s use of a personal email server.Since my letter, the FBI investigative team has been working around the clock to process and review a large volume of emails from a device obtained in connection with an unrelated criminal investigation.During that process, we reviewed all of the communications that were to or from Hillary Clinton while she was Secretary of State.Based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Secretary Clinton.I am very grateful to the professionals at the FBI for doing an extraordinary amount of high-quality work in a short period of time.

20103,WATCH: NY FIREFIGHTERS HOLD Touching Flag Removal Ceremony After Commissioner Orders ALL U.S. Flags To Be REMOVED From Fire Trucks For INSANE Reason [VIDEO],"As progressivism gets more of a stronghold in America, patriotism is being strangled by the anti-American Left Fire commissioners in Upstate New York ordered a fire department to remove the U.S. flags that were mounted on its firetrucks because they said the display was a  liability  to the firefighters and other motorists.Fire Chief Tory Gallante with the Arlington Fire District in Poughkeepsie said the Board of Fire Commissioners told him Monday to remove the two flags, which were fastened to the engine and the ladder truck. Obviously, I was disappointed with their directive,  he told The Washington Post.Gallante said that about 50 firefighters, veterans and members of the community came out Tuesday afternoon for a small, impromptu ceremony to properly take them down.  The guys were upset about the decision and wanted to remove them with dignity and respect,  he said.Firefighters flag removal ceremony can be seen here:Video from the ceremony shows the emergency response vehicles lined up outside the Arlington Fire District headquarters, where firefighters stood at attention.Both of the flags were taken down, properly folded and then handed to Gallante.Gallante added that he was not told to remove patriotic decals on the firetrucks.Joseph Tarquinio, president of the Arlington Professional Firefighters Association, said the union approached the fire chief months ago, proposing to pay for the flags and requesting permission to mount them.Gallante agreed, but he had conditions   including that the flags must be safely and securely fixed to the firetrucks and kept clean and well-maintained.Tarquinio said the union purchased two 3-by-5-foot flags made to withstand high winds and had them properly installed by the fire station s own mechanic.Tarquinio said, in the past, the department had U.S. flags on the firetrucks and would take them down during the harsh New York winters. When the department got new equipment a few years ago, he said, the flags were not put back. So with everything going on in the country, we thought it was time,  he told The Washington Post.  It was our way to show support   not for one particular sect but for the nation as a whole. The new flags had been flying with no known issues, Tarquinio said, when three of the five fire commissioners expressed concerns about  liability,  which Tarquinio called  a gross overstatement. Officials said since the board s decision Monday night, the fire department has been flooded with phone calls and emails from veterans and others in the community who oppose the order. A  rally for the flag  has been organized for the weekend, according to the Poughkeepsie Journal.  Washington Post",left-news,"Aug 18, 2016"
21110,WATCH HILLARY SQUIRM When Mainstream Media Asks If She Plans To Watch “13 Hours” Movie,"Hillary was too busy to be bothered with making Benghazi a safer place for Ambassador Stevens, so it should really come as no surprise that she s too busy to watch  13 HOURS,  the true story of Benghazi. By the way, whoever told Hillary that calling the families of the four men killed in Benghazi  liars,  just as the true story of what really happened under her watch is coming out in theaters nationwide, should be fired One of the enduring mysteries of the Benghazi tragedy is why anyone ever took seriously Hillary Clinton s blaming some obscure maker of a YouTube video for the attack. That mystery, however, is dwarfed by the way the media try to pretend that Hillary s denials of that happening are anything other than bald-faced (that bald-face would be pasty white, wrinkled, and bewhiskered). In testimony elicited by the Benghazi Committee and in released emails, it has become apparent that no one ever thought the video was to blame and Clinton has, herself, attempted to claim that she never blamed the video.Now there is a new  wrinkle  to the story. Hillary told the families that the video was the cause of the attack that led to the deaths of their family members. Now she is saying they are lying.First, there is her statement when she, shamelessly, stood in the hangar at Dover AFB as the bodies of the dead men returned home:CLINTON: Many others from across the Middle East and North Africa have offered similar sentiments.This has been a difficult week for the State Department and for our country. We ve seen the heavy assault on our post in Benghazi that took the lives of those brave men. We ve seen rage and violence directed at American embassies over an awful Internet video that we had nothing to do with.Then we have the families themselves:Transcript via TownhallTyrone Woods  father (who took notes about their meeting):  I gave Hillary a hug and shook her hand. And she said we are going to have the film maker arrested who was responsible for the death of my son She said   the filmmaker who was responsible for the death of your son Sean Smith s mother:  She s absolutely lying. She told me something entirely different at the casket ceremony. She said it was because of the video. Sean Smith s uncle:  Mrs. Clinton really has a problem embracing the truth. Glen Doherty s sister:  When I think back now to that day and what she knew, it shows me a lot about her character that she would choose in that moment to basically perpetuate what she knew was untrue. On ABC s This Week, Clinton family retainer, George Stephanopoulos, revisited the issue   I have no idea why other than some misbegotten effort to  set the record straight    and got this response:https://youtu.be/jAUDS-aLGjISTEPHANOPOULOS: Did you tell them it was about the film? And what s your response?CLINTON: No. You know, look I understand the continuing grief at the loss that parents experienced with the loss of these four brave Americans. And I did testify, as you know, for 11 hours. And I answered all of these questions. Now, I can t   I can t help it the people think there has to be something else there. I said very clearly there had been a terrorist group, uh, that had taken responsibility on Facebook, um, between the time that, uh, I   you know, when I talked to my daughter, that was the latest information; we were, uh, giving it credibility. And then we learned the next day it wasn t true. In fact, they retracted it. This was a fast-moving series of events in the fog of war and I think most Americans understand that.So we have Hillary blaming the video at the arrival of the caskets. We have all four families agreeing that they were told it was a video. We have Hillary on record blaming the video in the week after the attack. And now she says it never happened.This woman is a pathological liar. The sad thing is that she could probably pass a lie detector test. Via: Red State ",left-news,"Jan 17, 2016"
9393,LOL! DESPERATE KATHY GRIFFIN Makes Home Video To Complain About Not Getting Work After Trump Beheading Stunt…Takes Page From Hillary’s Playbook…Blames Everyone Else For End Of Her Career,"Wow! Poor Kathy Griffin The toxic  comedian  found herself facing a tsunami-sized backlash after she held a severed, and bloodied head of President Trump, during a comedy skit earlier in the year. And now, the former  funny girl  is telling anyone who will listen, that she s furious no one wants to hire her. Kathy Griffin starts her homemade 5-minute video by whining to viewers about all of the online  hate  by  trolls  that she s receiving. Griffin then goes on to trash the other  not funny  comedian Lena Dunham, who wrote about sexually assaulting her little sister, for defending a Hollywood actor who s been accused of sexually assaulting a female actress. Her comments that follow the Dunham remarks make no sense, although she seems to be attempting to make the point that the equally trashy liberal comedian, Lena Dunham, is still getting work, and how Griffin just doesn t think that it s fair. (After all, Dunham hates Trump as much as her right?)Griffin tells the camera that appears to be set up in her living room,  I just want you guys to know that I am fully in the middle of a blacklist like I m in the middle of a Hollywood blacklist. It is real. I m not booked on any talk shows. Griffen continued to whine about her lack of jobs,  I just want you guys to know, that when I get home, I do not have one single day of paid work in front of me, and the people who want me to go back and do clubs and do 10 minutes again I don t mean to be an asshole, but I m not gonna do that. I ve worked way too hard to go back and work for free, and do the club scene again because this is some bullshit. Because I ve been blacklisted.Griffin then goes on to tell her fellow Hollywood libs to stop sending her requests for donations to their fundraisers because she doesn t have any money. She goes on to explain that she s spent all of her money on lawyers because she believes in something. Griffin can t quite find a way to articulate what that something is, but she s apparently learned her lesson and has refrained from exposing her true obsession and desire, which was to destroy Donald Trump.Watch: ",politics,"Nov 19, 2017"

Candidates do need to buy permission to use music, but that often comes in a package. In other words, they buy rights to use music from the catalogues of organizations like Broadcast Music Inc (BMI) and the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP). In other words, they were likely within their legal rights, but that doesn t mean musicians should shut up.

22850,"The Demise of Progressive Democrats: ‘Resist and Submit, Retreat and Surrender’","21st Century Wire says The US 2016 Presidential Election was a watershed point in 21st century western politics. With the defeat of Hillary Clinton and the near collapse of the Democratic Party, it seems that America s  progressive  left has lost the ability to relate to much of the working and the middle classes. During the Obama Administration, the party was taken over by the billionaire donor class ruled by Wall Street interests, Silicon Valley svengalis, and the unelected commissariate   the Democratic National Committee (DNC). Their failed strategy of total reliance on identity politics at home, and backing Islamist extremism and a New Cold War with Russia abroad   has spelled abject failure for the US electorate. Still, the vanguard of the progressive left is still in denial of these realities. However, a new shake-up on the left may already be underway.Last month, America s latest progressive icon, Bernie Sanders had this to say Sanders: ""The Democratic Party is an absolute failure."" (June 11, 2017)See also: https://t.co/cnrVTiKUnn pic.twitter.com/mJxrguyMyM  WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) July 9, 2017While his candid depiction of a broken political party certainly rings true, it seems that Sanders is avoiding some of the more fundamental aspects of his party s rapid disintegration, namely the left s role in compromising America s reputation internationally by caving in to a largely Neoconservative and globalist foreign policy agenda, as author James Petras explains James Petras Information Clearing House Over the past quarter century progressive writers, activists and academics have followed a trajectory from left to right   with each presidential campaign seeming to move them further to the right. Beginning in the 1990 s progressives mobilized millions in opposition to wars, voicing demands for the transformation of the US s corporate for-profit medical system into a national Medicare For All public program. They condemned the notorious Wall Street swindlers and denounced police state legislation and violence. But in the end, they always voted for Democratic Party Presidential candidates who pursued the exact opposite agenda.Over time this political contrast between program and practice led to the transformation of the Progressives. And what we see today are US progressives embracing and promoting the politics of the far right.To understand this transformation we will begin by identifying who and what the progressives are and describe their historical role. We will then proceed to identify their trajectory over the recent decades.We will outline the contours of recent Presidential campaigns where Progressives were deeply involved.We will focus on the dynamics of political regression: From resistance to submission, from retreat to surrender.We will conclude by discussing the end result: The Progressives  large-scale, long-term embrace of far-right ideology and practice.Progressives by Name and PostureProgressives purport to embrace  progress , the growth of the economy, the enrichment of society and freedom from arbitrary government. Central to the Progressive agenda was the end of elite corruption and good governance, based on democratic procedures.Progressives prided themselves as appealing to  reason, diplomacy and conciliation , not brute force and wars. They upheld the sovereignty of other nations and eschewed militarism and armed intervention.Progressives proposed a vision of their fellow citizens pursuing incremental evolution toward the  good society , free from the foreign entanglements, which had entrapped the people in unjust wars.Progressives in Historical PerspectiveIn the early part of the 20th century, progressives favored political equality while opposing extra-parliamentary social transformations. They supported gender equality and environmental preservation while failing to give prominence to the struggles of workers and African Americans.They denounced militarism in general but supported a series of wars to end all wars . Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson embodied the dual policies of promoting peace at home and bloody imperial wars overseas. By the middle of the 20th century, different strands emerged under the progressive umbrella. Progressives split between traditional good government advocates and modernists who backed socio-economic reforms, civil liberties and rights.Progressives supported legislation to regulate monopolies, encouraged collective bargaining and defended the Bill of Rights.Progressives opposed wars and militarism in theory  until their government went to war.Lacking an effective third political party, progressives came to see themselves as the left wing of the Democratic Party, allies of labor and civil rights movements and defenders of civil liberties.Progressives joined civil rights leaders in marches, but mostly relied on legal and electoral means to advance African American rights.Progressives played a pivotal role in fighting McCarthyism, though ultimately it was the Secretary of the Army and the military high command that brought Senator McCarthy to his knees.Progressives provided legal defense when the social movements disrupted the House UnAmerican Activities Committee.They popularized the legislative arguments that eventually outlawed segregation, but it was courageous Afro-American leaders heading mass movements that won the struggle for integration and civil rights.In many ways the Progressives complemented the mass struggles, but their limits were defined by the constraints of their membership in the Democratic Party.The alliance between Progressives and social movements peaked in the late sixties to mid-1970 s when the Progressives followed the lead of dynamic and advancing social movements and community organizers especially in opposition to the wars in Indochina and the military draft.The Retreat of the ProgressivesBy the late 1970 s the Progressives had cut their anchor to the social movements, as the anti-war, civil rights and labor movements lost their impetus (and direction).The numbers of progressives within the left wing of the Democratic Party increased through recruitment from earlier social movements. Paradoxically, while their  numbers  were up, their caliber had declined, as they sought to  fit in  with the pro-business, pro-war agenda of their President s party.Without the pressure of the  populist street  the Progressives-turned-Democrats adapted to the corporate culture in the Party. The Progressives signed off on a fatal compromise: The corporate elite secured the electoral party while the Progressives were allowed to write enlightened manifestos about the candidates and their programs . . . which were quickly dismissed once the Democrats took office. Yet the ability to influence the  electoral rhetoric  was seen by the Progressives as a sufficient justification for remaining inside the Democratic Party.Moreover the Progressives argued that by strengthening their presence in the Democratic Party, (their self-proclaimed boring from within strategy), they would capture the party membership, neutralize the pro-corporation, militarist elements that nominated the president and peacefully transform the party into a  vehicle for progressive changes .Upon their successful  deep penetration  the Progressives, now cut off from the increasingly disorganized mass social movements, coopted and bought out many prominent black, labor and civil liberty activists and leaders, while collaborating with what they dubbed the more malleable centrist Democrats. These mythical creatures were really pro-corporate Democrats who condescended to occasionally converse with the Progressives while working for the Wall Street and Pentagon elite.The Retreat of the Progressives: The Clinton DecadeProgressives adapted the  crab strategy : Moving side-ways and then backwards but never forward.Progressives mounted candidates in the Presidential primaries, which were predictably defeated by the corporate Party apparatus, and then submitted immediately to the outcome. The election of President  Bill  Clinton launched a period of unrestrained financial plunder, major wars of aggression in Europe (Yugoslavia) and the Middle East (Iraq), a military intervention in Somalia and secured Israel s victory over any remnant of a secular Palestinian leadership as well as its destruction of Lebanon!Progressives followed Clinton s deep throated thrust toward the far right, as he outsourced manufacturing jobs to Mexico (NAFTA) and re-appointed Federal Reserve s free market, Ayn Rand-fanatic, Alan Greenspan.Like a huge collective  Monica Lewinsky  robot, the Progressives in the Democratic Party bent over and swallowed Clinton s vicious 1999 savaging of the venerable Glass Steagall Act, thereby opening the floodgates for massive speculation on Wall Street through the previously regulated banking sector. When President Clinton gutted welfare programs, forcing single mothers to take minimum-wage jobs without provision for safe childcare, millions of poor white and minority women were forced to abandon their children to dangerous makeshift arrangements in order to retain any residual public support and access to minimal health care. Progressives looked the other way.Progressives repeatedly kneeled before President Clinton marking their submission to the Democrats   hard right  policies.The election of Republican President G. W. Bush (2001-2009) permitted Progressive s to temporarily trot out and burnish their anti-war, anti-Wall Street credentials. Out in the street, they protested Bush s savage invasion of Iraq (but not the destruction of Afghanistan). They protested the media reports of torture in Abu Ghraib under Bush, but not the massive bombing and starvation of millions of Iraqis that had occurred under Clinton. Progressives protested the expulsion of immigrants from Mexico and Central America, but were silent over the brutal uprooting of refugees resulting from US wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, or the systematic destruction of their nations  infrastructure.Progressives embraced Israel s bombing, jailing and torture of Palestinians by voting unanimously in favor of increasing the annual $3 billion dollar military handouts to the brutal Jewish State. They supported Israel s bombing and slaughter in Lebanon.Progressives were in retreat, but retained a muffled voice and inconsequential vote in favor of peace, justice and civil liberties. They kept a certain distance from the worst of the police state decrees by the Republican Administration.Progressives and Obama: From Retreat to SurrenderWhile Progressives maintained their tepid commitment to civil liberties, and their highly  leveraged  hopes for peace in the Middle East, they jumped uncritically into the highly choreographed Democratic Party campaign for Barack Obama,  Wall Street s First Black President .Progressives had given up their quest to  realign  the Democratic Party from within : they turned from serious tourism to permanent residency. Progressives provided the foot soldiers for the election and re-election of the warmongering  Peace Candidate  Obama. After the election, Progressives rushed to join the lower echelons of his Administration. Black and white politicos joined hands in their heroic struggle to erase the last vestiges of the Progressives  historical legacy.Obama increased the number of Bush-era imperial wars to attacking seven weak nations under American s  First Black  President s bombardment, while the Progressives ensured that the streets were quiet and empty.When Obama provided trillions of dollars of public money to rescue Wall Street and the bankers, while sacrificing two million poor and middle class mortgage holders, the Progressives only criticized the bankers who received the bailout, but not Obama s Presidential decision to protect and reward the mega-swindlers.Under the Obama regime social inequalities within the United States grew at an unprecedented rate. The Police State Patriot Act was massively extended to give President Obama the power to order the assassination of US citizens abroad without judicial process. The Progressives did not resign when Obama s  kill orders  extended to the  mistaken  murder of his target s children and other family member, as well as unidentified bystanders. The icon carriers still paraded their banner of the first black American President when tens of thousands of black Libyans and immigrant workers were slaughtered in his regime-change war against President Gadhafi Continue this article at Information Clearing HouseREAD MORE POLICE STATE NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Police State FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE  SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",Middle-east,"July 14, 2017"

But he is also registered to vote at the home of a friend, Andy Badolato, in the Sunshine State. He changed his address in Florida in August, shortly after reports surfaced that he was previously registered at an abandoned house. Bannon did not commit voter fraud in any way, but according to Trump he is a criminal simply because he has an outdated registration in Florida.This must be uncomfortable for Trump, whose false claims about what does and does not constitute fraud has nailed one of his senior minions, but it s likely that he will ignore it because it doesn t quite fit his narrative that millions of people voted illegally for Hillary Clinton, and that is why he lost the popular vote.Did you ever think you would see the President abuse the powers of his office to satisfy his ego and push a debunked conspiracy theory? Yeah, we didn t either, but here we are.Featured image via Getty Images/Mark Wilson",News,"January 25, 2017"

This portion of her speech seems to emphasize her role in getting the naming done. That was his point, she needs the spotlight hence her using the death of a soldier and the families grief as a political football trying to score political points.In case you missed the wonderful message from Chief of Staff Kelly:White House Chief of Staff John Kelly says he was stunned to learn that Congresswoman Frederica Wilson listened in on the president s call to a fallen soldier s wife. He came into the White House press briefing and let the press have it too. He goes through the steps of what happens when someone in the military is killed. He says that the members of our military are the best 1% of our population. He said he was  brokenhearted  when he found out what a member of congress did. This is a heartfelt moment that is amazing:KELLY DOES A GREAT JOB OF CUTTING THROUGH THE BS FROM THE PRESS:The retired general who lost his own son in Afghanistan said the call to Sgt. La David T. Johnson s wife should have been  sacred. It stuns me that a member of congress would have listened in on that conversation. Absolutely stuns me. I thought at least that was sacred,  he said.The White House official found himself at the center of a charge that President Barack Obama  didn t make calls  to the families of fallen soldiers this week after President Trump claimed that Obama didn t call Kelly when his son Robert died.Kelly said Thursday at a White House news conference that it s true   but he wasn t offended.In fact, Kelly says he counseled Trump not to call Gold Star families and to instead write letters.Read more: Daily Mail",politics,"Oct 20, 2017"

19826,WOW! 1996 NYT’s Stunning Article SLAYS First Lady Hillary Clinton…Calls Her A “CONGENITAL LIAR”…”she is in the longtime habit of lying; and she has never been called to account for lying”,"How did we ever get to the point where we would even  consider electing a woman who is the most well-known liar in America? The media has been buzzing since what many consider an inappropriate private conversation that Donald J. Trump had with another man 11 years ago was released. Funny how the media is willing to gloss over a shameful career of a  congenital liar  simply because her last name is Clinton (wife of the former President Bill Clinton who was impeached for lying under oath to a Grand Jury) and because she comes equipped with the right genitatlia   Americans of all political persuasions are coming to the sad realization that our First Lady   a woman of undoubted talents who was a role model for many in her generation   is a congenital liar.Drip by drip, like Whitewater torture, the case is being made that she is compelled to mislead, and to ensnare her subordinates and friends in a web of deceit.1. Remember the story she told about studying The Wall Street Journal to explain her 10,000 percent profit in 1979 commodity trading? We now know that was a lie told to turn aside accusations that as the Governor s wife she profited corruptly, her account being run by a lawyer for state poultry interests through a disreputable broker.She lied for good reason: To admit otherwise would be to confess taking, and paying taxes on, what some think amounted to a $100,000 bribe.2. The abuse of Presidential power known as Travelgate elicited another series of lies. She induced a White House lawyer to assert flatly to investigators that Mrs. Clinton did not order the firing of White House travel aides, who were then harassed by the F.B.I. and Justice Department to justify patronage replacement by Mrs. Clinton s cronies.Now we know, from a memo long concealed from investigators, that there would be  hell to pay  if the furious First Lady s desires were scorned. The career of the lawyer who transmitted Hillary s lie to authorities is now in jeopardy. Again, she lied with good reason: to avoid being identified as a vindictive political power player who used the F.B.I. to ruin the lives of people standing in the way of juicy patronage.3. In the aftermath of the apparent suicide of her former partner and closest confidant, White House Deputy Counsel Vincent Foster, she ordered the overturn of an agreement to allow the Justice Department to examine the files in the dead man s office. Her closest friends and aides, under oath, have been blatantly disremembering this likely obstruction of justice, and may have to pay for supporting Hillary s lie with jail terms.Again, the lying was not irrational. Investigators believe that damning records from the Rose Law Firm, wrongfully kept in Vincent Foster s White House office, were spirited out in the dead of night and hidden from the law for two years   in Hillary s closet, in Web Hubbell s basement before his felony conviction, in the President s secretary s personal files   before some were forced out last week.Why the White House concealment? For good reason: The records show Hillary Clinton was lying when she denied actively representing a criminal enterprise known as the Madison S.& L., and indicate she may have conspired with Web Hubbell s father-in-law to make a sham land deal that cost taxpayers $3 million.Why the belated release of some of the incriminating evidence? Not because it mysteriously turned up in offices previously searched. Certainly not because Hillary Clinton and her new hang-tough White House counsel want to respond fully to lawful subpoenas.One reason for the Friday-night dribble of evidence from the White House is the discovery by the F.B.I. of copies of some of those records elsewhere. When Clinton witnesses are asked about specific items in  lost  records   which investigators have   the White House  finds  its copy and releases it. By concealing the Madison billing records two days beyond the statute of limitations, Hillary evaded a civil suit by bamboozled bank regulators.Another reason for recent revelations is the imminent turning of former aides and partners of Hillary against her; they were willing to cover her lying when it advanced their careers, but are inclined to listen to their own lawyers when faced with perjury indictments.Therefore, ask not  Why didn t she just come clean at the beginning?  She had good reasons to lie; she is in the longtime habit of lying; and she has never been called to account for lying herself or in suborning lying in her aides and friends.No wonder the President is fearful of holding a prime-time press conference. Having been separately deposed by the independent counsel at least twice, the President and First Lady would be well advised to retain separate defense counsel.

6672, Michael Jordan Condemns North Carolina Anti-LGBT Law,"North Carolina Republicans just got slam-dunked by the greatest NBA player of all time.Their bigotry has cost the state many economic opportunities since HB2 was signed into law. Corporations are cancelling projects. Entertainers are cancelling performances. The federal government is looking into stopping the flow of federal cash into the state. The NBA has threatened to pull the All-Star game out of the state. Yet Republicans are refusing to repeal the law that literally allows business owners to discriminate against LGBT people.It s all because Republicans are obsessed with transgender people using the bathroom.According to conservatives, the law is necessary to protect women and children from sexual predators whom they claim will use transgender protections as a shield to defend going into women s restrooms and locker rooms to commit sexual assault. But that claim has been debunked, even by Fox News, because there has not been a single instance of that scenario occurring in the 17 states and over 200 cities that have transgender protections in place.Now NBA legend Michael Jordan has spoken out against the law, declaring in a statement that the Charlotte Hornets organization does not support discrimination and that the Time Warner Cable Arena will continue to be a safe and inclusive place for everyone.Jordan issued the following statement through the Charlotte Observer on April 27: As my organization has stated previously, the Charlotte Hornets and Hornets Sports & Entertainment are opposed to discrimination in any form, and we have always sought to provide an inclusive environment. As has been the case since the building opened, we will continue to ensure that all fans, players and employees feel welcome while at work or attending NBA games and events in Time Warner Cable Arena. This should be considered a strong statement by His Airness considering his history of declining to get involved in politics.Jordan was raised in North Carolina. He went to high school there and attended college at the University of North Carolina where he played basketball for the Tar Heels before being drafted by the Chicago Bulls in 1984. He would go on to win six championships with the Bulls and is widely regarded as the best player in the history of the game.He is now the owner of the Charlotte Hornets and is considered one of the most influential and powerful figures in the state, so this statement carries a lot of weight. Now one just has to wonder how long it will be before Republicans pass a bill specifically banning transgender people from using the bathroom at the Time Warner Cable Arena.Featured image via YouTube",News,"April 27, 2016"
8272, Texas Governor Wants Christian Crosses On Cop Cars,"In a brief sent to the state Attorney General s office on February 5, Texas Governor Greg Abbott insisted that putting Christian crosses on police vehicles is a Constitutional right.In his brief, Abbott wrote: Even under the U.S. Supreme Court s expansive interpretation of the Establishment Clause s limited and unambiguous text, the Court has never held that public officials are barred from acknowledging our religious heritage. To the contrary, the U.S. Supreme Court has long recognized the demographic and historical reality that Americans  are a religious people whose institutions presuppose a Supreme Being. Of course that an absolute lie. The Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled against any government sponsorship or endorsement of religion.Abbott goes on to claim that Christian cross bumper stickers on police vehicles  neither establish a religion nor threaten any person s ability to worship God, or decline to worship God, in his own way. I wonder if he would feel the same way about Islamic symbols on police vehicles? What about symbols used by the church of Satan? Do those belong on police vehicles?Like most Americans, I am tired of hearing the religious right whine about how their religion is under attack in the U.S., every time a judge tells them they cannot use public funds and resources to promote their personal religious beliefs.There is a big difference between the state oppressing Christians and the state banning Christians from promoting or endorsing their religion with taxpayer dollars and/or taxpayer property.If you want to put a Christian bumper sticker on your personal vehicle, no-one is standing in your way. If you want to put one on a publicly owned vehicle, that s an entirely different story.Why is this so difficult for right-wing Christians to comprehend?Much to the dismay of the Christian right, the government is not a vehicle for enforcing their hypocritical religious beliefs on the public.In light of the Christian right s constant attempts to use government to force their religious doctrine on others, it makes perfect sense that they would try to slap Biblical bumper stickers on police cars.When state legislatures pass laws banning oral and anal sex, denying rights to the LGBT community, attempting to ban non-Christians from practicing their religious beliefs, making atheist marriage illegal, even suggesting laws that would make not going to church a crime, it s already frighteningly clear that they want police to act as the armed enforcers of their religious doctrine.In spite of Governor Abbott s ill-informed brief on this subject, even the slightest semblance of police being used as the  enforcers of Christianity  is a clear violation of the Establishment Clause.Over and over and over again these right-wing nuts whine about how their religion is being oppressed in the United States.Let s get something straight. Religious oppression is when the government attempts to keep you from practicing your religion on your own time and using your own resources. Barring you from using the stuff other people paid for to promote your religion, is not oppressive.If the government were to force all Christians to wear a special ID badge designating their religion, that would be oppressive. Or if the government were to bar Christians from entering the country, simply because of their religion, that would be oppressive. Or if the government were to create a special database for Christians so that they could be easily identified and closely watched, that would be oppressive.Only the government does not do that to Christians.On the other hand, right-wing Christians in government, including Texas Governor, Greg Abbott, sincerely want to do those things to Muslims.Thankfully, the establishment clause was created to protect Christians from experiencing the kind of government oppression they would gladly inflict on others.It s also there to protect the rest of us from right-wing Christians who would use our government, our tax dollars, our public property and our public employees to force their skewed version of Christianity down everyone s throat with a police-issued revolver.Image from johndoeforty1 on Flckr, cc 2.0. *Some changes were made to this image",News,"February 7, 2016"

2493, WATCH: Trump Assumes Black Reporter Can Set Up A Meeting With Black Lawmakers For Him,"After claiming that he s  the least racist person,  Donald trump literally assumed a black reporter could set up a meeting with the Congressional Black Caucus for him.Seriously, that actually happened during Trump s first solo press conference on Thursday.After talking about our inner cities like they are apocalyptic crime-infested war zones, American Urban Radio Networks reporter April Ryan asked Trump if he will work with the Congressional Black Caucus. Trump s response was to assume that because Ryan is black she ll know the CBC members. He then told her to set up a meeting with them as if she is his servant. And then he accused Rep. Elijah Cummings of refusing to meet with him.Ryan: When you say inner cities, are you gonna include the CBC, Mr. President, in the conversations with your urban agenda, your inner city agenda, as well as Trump: Am I gonna am I gonna include who?Ryan: Are you gonna include the Congressional Black Caucus and  Trump: Well, I would. I tell you what, you want to set up the meeting? Do you want to set up the meeting?Ryan: No, no, no I m just a reporter.Trump: Are they friends of yours?Ryan: I know some of them  Trump: No, go ahead, set up the meeting. Let s go. Set up a meeting, I would love to meet with the black caucus. I think it s great, the Congressional Black Caucus, I think it s great. I actually thought I had a meeting with Congressman Cummings, and he was all excited, and then he said, oh, I can t move. It might be bad for me politically. I can t have that meeting. I was all set to have that meeting. You know we called him and called him. And he was all set. I spoke to him on the phone, a nice guy.Ryan: I hear he wanted that meeting with you as well.Trump: He wanted it. But we called called called called. I can t make a meeting with him. Every day, I walk in, I said, I would like to meet with him, because I do want to solve the problem. But he probably was told by Schumer or somebody like that, some other lightweight.He was probably told   he was probably told, don t meet with Trump. It s bad politics.

12290,“PARTISAN DEMOCRAT” Will Oversee WI Presidential Recount: Was Part Of Corrupt “John Doe” Case…A “Vicious and unhinged political crusade against conservatives” [VIDEO],"The Wisconsin Elections Commission announced Friday that it would hold a statewide recount of the presidential vote. The move was in response to petitions from two candidates, the Green Party s Jill Stein and independent Rocky Roque De La Fuente.Federal law requires that all recounts be finished 35 days after the election, which is Dec. 13. One or both of the candidates will be required to pay for the recount. We have assembled an internal team to direct the recount, we have been in close consultation with our county clerk partners, and have arranged for legal representation by the Wisconsin Department of Justice,  said Wisconsin Elections Commission Director Mike Haas in a statement.  NPRHillary Clinton s camp finally made a public announcement that they were jumping into the recount effort, after admonishing Trump for the mere suggestion that he may not accept the result of the election. After a period of public silence about the results of the 2016 election, Hillary Clinton s top campaign lawyer said the campaign will play a role in the Wisconsin recount initiated Friday by Green Party candidate Jill Stein. The Clinton campaign will follow the same approach in Michigan and Pennsylvania if the third-party hopeful pursues recounts in those states. Because we had not uncovered any actionable evidence of hacking or outside attempts to alter the voting technology, we had not planned to exercise this option ourselves, but now that a recount has been initiated in Wisconsin, we intend to participate in order to ensure the process proceeds in a manner that is fair to all sides,  Marc Elias, Clinton s general counsel, wrote Saturday on Medium.   PoliticoWisconsin Elections Commission Director Mike Haas played a role in the Wisconsin  John Doe  affair, one of the most disgusting, strong-arm events against conservatives by Democrat government officials in the history of the United States.The Wisconsin John Doe affair is one of the more shameful episodes in modern American political history, in which a hyper-partisan Democrat district attorney weaponized the Wisconsin legal system against innocent families as part of a vicious and unhinged political crusade against conservatives. An assembly line of rubber-stamped search warrants and subpoenas, early-morning raids, threats from police officers to keep quiet, wanton property seizure:  I no longer feel safe,  one victim said,  and I don t think I ever will. The victims received such treatment simply because they dared to hold political opinions offensive to Wisconsin Democrats.Watch here to see the horrifying truth about what happened with the attack on conservatives in the WI John Doe case that WI Elections Commissions Director Mike Haas was involved in:Injecting a measure of sanity into the whole sleazy affair, the Wisconsin Supreme Court last year ordered the investigation halted and the seized evidence destroyed. It is utterly clear, wrote Justice Gableman,  that the special prosecutor has employed theories of law that do not exist in order to investigate citizens who were wholly innocent of any wrongdoing.  Later they would amend the order slightly: instead of destroying the evidence, it was to be sealed and turned over to the court.The court order was entirely reasonable. After they shockingly abused the investigatory apparatus of the Wisconsin state government, the John Doe squad s evidence could reasonably be considered corrupted.It is clear that someone involved in the John Doe investigation, incensed that a court had slapped down his or her gross abuse of state power, decided to disobey a court order and attempt one final time to destroy Walker s political career. It will not work, of course Walker appears to have done nothing actionable but the leak is nonetheless troubling, chiefly because it underscores yet again the persistent lawlessness of much of American liberalism.This is not an aberration. Much of modern American liberalism s tactics rest upon a vicious set of double standards and abuses of government power. The IRS s targeting of political opponents; its maltreatment of conservative advocacy groups; the targeting of conservative politicians; the proposals to persecute climate-change skeptics; the tactical lawsuits to punish pro-life advocacy it is all of a piece, all meant to silence conservative voices and stymie conservative political efforts.  The FederalistPerhaps recent revelations of partisanship by staff at the  nonpartisan  state Government Accountability Board should come as no surprise.At least not if you know from where those staffers come.The Wall Street Journal and Wisconsin Watchdog have reported on former GAB staff counsel Shane Falk s partisan emails related to the political John Doe investigation into dozens of conservative groups and the campaign of Gov. Scott Walker. That investigation, it is becoming increasingly clear, was driven in large part by the accountability board, Wisconsin s finance, election, and ethics law regulator. Falk was a big player at the agency and in the political probe.Falk, who in 2008 urged the GAB to find ways to  get around the constitutional right to free speech, once served as the Democratic appointee on the state elections board, the GAB s predecessor.Haas, long before he began working for the GAB in 2008, was an aide for then-Assembly Speaker Thomas A. Loftus, D-Sun Prairie, in 1989. And Haas was at the center of campaign finance controversy that pre-dated the so-called  Caucus Scandal more than a decade later and the more recent unconstitutional John Doe probe the state Supreme Court has ordered shut down.In September 1989, Wisconsin GOP chairman Donald K. Stitt accused Loftus of  subsidizing  his campaign for governor with state funds.By adding one of his campaign staffers as a part-time office worker, Loftus  has got his campaign hirelings feeding at the trough,  Stitt said, as quoted in a brief in the Sept. 20, 1989, edition of the Milwaukee Sentinel.The staffer in question? Haas, a Sun Prairie native and the future arbiter of Wisconsin election law.A Loftus spokeswoman at the time denied the charge, insisting Haas would work part-time as a  legitimate  aide to Loftus and  be off the public payroll  when he works for Loftus  campaign.A similar allegation led to a six-month sentence on a felony conviction in 2012 for former Walker aide Kelly Rindfleisch at the hands of John Doe prosecutors, led by a Democratic Milwaukee County district attorney.Rindfleisch, who is soon to conclude her sentence, was charged with  misconduct in office  for doing contracted campaign work for a candidate for lieutenant governor. She, like many other former aides and allies of Walker, was targeted in an ever-expanding secret John Doe investigation. Haas was not.As conservative talk show host Charlie Sykes pointed out in a 2003 investigative piecefor the Wisconsin Policy Research Institute, Loftus led a Democratic Caucus staff that devoted their time to political campaigns.Such activities were treated as felonies when prosecutors  in another secret John Doe  went after lawmakers like Loftus  Republican successor, former Assembly Speaker Scott Jensen.As Sykes wrote, a 1986 memo  proudly recounted how legislative staffers had run campaigns, helped raise money, written political commercials, developed campaign literature, operated  spy  phone banks, provided writing and research, orchestrated campaign swings, helped with mailings, and traveled to local districts to make campaign phone calls and go door-to door for candidates. The memo also makes clear that members of individual legislators  staffs played integral roles in the re-election campaigns of the incumbents,  Sykes wrote. One of our best assets in the incumbent campaigns was each legislator s staff,  the memo boasted.Haas  political work for Loftus, however, was missing from the GAB s press release in December 2012 when he was named elections division administrator.GAB director Kevin Kennedy simply noted that Haas joined the agency in 2008 as one of two staff attorneys who advised the board on legal matters. In the release, Kennedy praised Haas  legal advice and management skills in the agency s  successful processing of nearly 2 million recall petition signatures  in the bitter recall campaigns of 2012.Haas told the publication that working on Democratic campaigns for governor, president and Congress and then running for the Assembly seat  exorcised partisanship and any future run for office  out of my system. I turned out to be a better nonpartisan administrator than a politician,  Haas told the publication.Kennedy, at the time, said he knew of Haas  partisan past, but added that  everybody has a past. As elections administrator, Haas did not have the kind of involvement in the John Doe probe that others have. But the partisan backgrounds of GAB administrators and key staff members raise questions about their ability to remain nonpartisan amid revelations of partisan conduct.Late last month the Wall Street Journal s editorial board reported that GAB staff, including Kennedy, worked with John Doe special prosecutor Francis Schmitz and the Milwaukee County District Attorney s Office (run by a partisan Democrat) to  subpoena and intimidate the major conservative players in Wisconsin.

5083, Lesbian Couple In New Jersey Insists State Is Forcing Them To Have Sex With Men (VIDEO),"Two women in New Jersey are suing the state for one horrific obstacle that is in their path to having children   the women are lesbians, and they say the state is forcing them to have sex with men before they are allowed fertility treatments.According to the suit, the women were denied insurance coverage for their fertility treatments because of the wording of an N.J. law that requires women to prove their infertility not only through medical diagnosis, but through unprotected heterosexual sex. The law, the four women argue in the suit, discriminates against infertile gay couples trying to conceive.State law requires large insurance providers to cover costly fertility treatments for patients medically unable to have children. The couples take issue with how the law defines infertility, which includes the inability to become pregnant after one or two years of unprotected sex, depending on a woman s age. Insurance companies have been able to deny coverage to gay patients who, although they have been medically diagnosed infertile, do not fit the definition, the suit says.Source: New Jersey.comErin Krupas is infertile. Her doctor confirmed it, but that s not enough for New Jersey law. She needs to prove it by having sex with a man.You wouldn t think of a law like this existing in mostly blue New Jersey, but remember they did elect Chris Christie twice. He s still vehemently opposed to marriage equality, despite the fact that it s the law of the land. Christie didn t sign this archaic law, but you can bet he has no intention of making lives better for LGBT couples.I hate defending insurance companies, but they are caught in the middle here. Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield vehemently maintains that they do not discriminate against LGBT couples, but they have to follow state law.

4810, White Supremacist Chases Down Black Teen And Kills Him In Oregon,"Just remember that white supremacists support Donald Trump and the Republican Party.Because if they take power in November, racists like this guy will think they have free license to kill black people at will.Earlier this month, Russell Courtier and his girlfriend Colleen Hunt stopped at a convenience store near Portland, Oregon and started a fight with 19-year-old Larnell Bruce, a young black man.Courtier has repeatedly run afoul of the law, but keeps being let out of his cage. While in prison, he became the leader of the European Kindred, a white supremacist group. Courtier had just been paroled for attacking a woman with a knife in 2013.Anyway, Courtier slammed Bruce s head into the glass window as Hunt cheered. To defend himself, Bruce pulled a knife and Courtier retreated to his Jeep. The fight should have ended there, but Courtier wanted blood, so he violated a series of traffic laws in an effort to run Bruce over.By the time police arrived it was too late. Bruce was severely injured and Courtier and his girlfriend had fled the scene. Bruce died days later at the hospital due to the severity of his injuries.Both Courtier and Hunt were later arrested and now they have been indicted for murder and will likely face charges for committing a hate crime.Frankly, this is one of those cases where law enforcement and our judicial system failed the public simply because Courtier is white. He has four felony convictions and seven misdemeanors on his record, yet he was still unleashed upon society. On the flip side, African-Americans are being shot by police in the streets for doing nothing criminal whatsoever. If Courtier were black, he d either be dead before he ever saw the inside of a courtroom or he would be imprisoned for life without the possibility of parole. He certainly would not have received as many chances for freedom as he has squandered.But Courtier is white, and now the Oregon judiciary has blood on their hands.What may be even scarier is the fact that white supremacists like Courtier are big fans of Donald Trump because they believe he ll make America white again and bring their racist cause into the mainstream.These are people who cheer for the killing of black people and are just waiting for the day when they can do so with impunity.If you want a glimpse of what Donald Trump s America would look like, the murder of Larnell Bruce by a white supremacist in the middle of an open street should tell you everything you need to know.Featured image via Multnomah County Sheriff s Office",News,"September 1, 2016"

She made two circles with her thumbs and forefingers and pressed them against each other so they touched, like binoculars. This Venn diagram represents the interests of people and government, she said.  They don t have very much in common. Today, she s not a registered Republican, but like many of the readers of her newspaper, she said she s starting to lean toward supporting Donald Trump for president. The other self-styled outsider in the race, though, holds no appeal for her. The only Bern she and many other Russians here are feeling is the one in the banya.To Sundeyeva, left-wingers seem to yearn for a workers  revolution.  I would ask them: Have you ever lived under a revolution?  she said.  Do you know what it s like? When someone comes and takes your family member in the night? Interviews with more than a dozen immigrants from the former Soviet Union in the Bay Area suggest that some in the community are recoiling from Bernie Sanders and his leftist ideals. One hundred years after the Bolshevik Revolution swept Communists into power, some Russians in America say they can t believe a serious candidate in the United States is calling himself a socialist.Many of us can t believe it either, folks.Bernie s support among young people can be chalked up to ignorance. Millennials have no memory of the Soviet Union or the horrors people endured under socialism. They ve grown up in the most free country in the world and have never wanted for anything.

4362, Trump LIVID After Legit National Poll Gives Him A Reality Check (IMAGES),"Just judging from Donald Trump s disastrous performance at the first presidential debate last week, it was clear that Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton came out the winner. Trump couldn t give solid answers for any of the questions moderator Lester Holt asked, fact-checkers called him out for lying constantly, and his weaknesses on policy were exposed for all to see. Still, Trump insisted for days that he d won the debate and that he was rising in the polls, all while citing inaccurate or bogus statistics.A new national poll has come out to set the record straight. According to the latest NBC News|SurveyMonkey Weekly Election Tracking Poll, Clinton is ahead of Trump, 46% to 40%   and unlike any of Trump s polls, it s actually legit. Here s how the election is panning out so far:Now, Trump is probably going to claim that this poll (AND this election, AND the upcoming debate) is  rigged    because he always comes up with an excuse for why he sucks. But the truth is, Trump only has himself to blame.This poll also discovered that one of the main reasons Trump is failing so hard is because he s destroyed his chances of appealing to women. Last election, women accounted for 53% of voters   and you can bet that more women than ever will come out to vote in November to prevent the most misogynistic presidential candidate from getting into the White House. Thanks to Trump s sexist, degrading and objectifying attacks and comments, Trump has pretty much excluded women from his fan base. Even GOP women hate him!This was especially true for women who were not married. Trump s standing with minorities is even more horrendous. He has never even been able to leave the single digits when it comes to African American voters!Good job, Trump! You re in the home stretch of the election, and you re destroying your campaign by the day. SAD!Featured image via Ralph Freso / Getty Images ",News,"October 4, 2016"

8128, Cruz Humiliated By Moderator After Lie About Presidents Not Appointing Justices In Election Year,"Almost immediately after learning that longtime Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia had passed away suddenly while on a hunting trip in Texas, Sen. Ted Cruz joined his fellow Republican senators in boldly announcing that they would oppose any nomination that President Obama made and block the process for the remaining 361 days of his term.Justice Scalia was an American hero. We owe it to him, & the Nation, for the Senate to ensure that the next President names his replacement.  Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) February 13, 2016Republicans, Cruz included, were instantly greeted with a collective  what the hell are you thinking?  from the American people. The ability to appoint a Supreme Court Justice to replace one that has retired or passed away is the president s right by constitutional law. It s been this way for hundred of years. Suggesting otherwise is a violation of one of the country bedrock democratic principles.At the Republican Debate held later in the day, Cruz was asked to justify how torching the Constitution was defensible just because he didn t like the current president. He responded that it wasn t fair to appoint a new justice during an election year. In fact, he claimed, one hadn t been appointed during the last year of a presidency in over 80 years.Instantly, moderator John Dickerson s bullshit detector lit up. Cruz s lie was so egregious that his pants may as well have spontaneously combusted. I m sorry to interrupt, were any nominees appointed in an election year? Or was that just 80 years, there happened to be [no appointees in an election year]? Cruz doubles down on his lie: There were 80 years of not confirming. For example, LBJ nominated Abe Fordus, Fordus did not get confirmed he was defeated. So John Dickerson drops the hammer: But Kennedy was confirmed in [an election year] 1988. Cruz comes back with lie number 3: No Kennedy was confirmed in 1987. Which is immediately fact-checked yet again: He was appointed in  87, confirmed in  88. In other words, just a few decades ago, the country was faced with a similar dilemma   and they stuck with the Constitution. The legal team at NBC News confirmed that Kennedy was indeed nominated in 1987, but confirmed in 1988. The country was fine with this.For the record, Justice Anthony Kennedy was confirmed in 1988 but nominated in 1987. (We've been doing some research over here at #MTP)  Shawna Thomas (@ShawnaNBCNews) February 14, 2016As usual, Cruz has no leg to stand on. He simply wants his way and doesn t want to be bothered worrying about the facts.

6177, WATCH: Kimmel Tells Hypocrite Trump He’s ‘Full Of Sh*t’ To His Face,"Donald Trump s past support of Hillary Clinton came back to bite him on the ass during an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live.During the Wednesday night broadcast, Kimmel introduced presumptive Republican nominee Trump and after briefly chiding him for his taco bowl tweet on Cinco de Mayo proceeded to ask him if he really thought his campaign for the presidency would ever get this far. When you started all this, I just have to believe that you thought  This will be fun, it ll be a four month thing  and you never imagined it would go this far. Is that true?  Kimmel asked.Trump replied that he didn t think his campaign would come out on top so quickly. He thought there would end up being two conventions with one in July and one in August to determine the GOP nominee. Trump also claimed that he believed Hillary would have won the Democratic nomination long before now, but said he enjoys watching her.Kimmel then asked Trump if he is  enjoying the Hillary/Bernie struggle.  Well I do,  Trump said. And then Trump failed to see the irony as called the battle between to two Democrats  nasty  and that he hates to see that. It s getting nasty,  Trump continued.  I had no idea it was going to be so nasty. And you hate that,  Kimmel replied.  You don t like that. Yeah, I hate to see it,  Trump answered.  I hate to see it. Donald Trump s campaign is one of the nastiest in American political history, perhaps only topped by the 1828 Election.At rally after rally, Trump has spewed violent rhetoric, encouraged intimidation, and launched racist and sexist attacks against anyone who opposes him, including Hillary Clinton, whose husband has been the latest target of vicious attacks by Trump.The mentioning of Hillary Clinton, however, gave Kimmel the opportunity to hilariously hit Trump with statements he made about Hillary in 2008 and 2012. In 2008 you said you thought Hillary  would make an excellent president  and as recently as 2012 you said you thought she was  terrific.' Kimmel asked Trump to explain why he made those remarks and what has changed.Trump claimed that he says good things about all politicians as a businessman, to which Kimmel replied,  So you were full of shit when you said that. Trump could only shake his head in agreement and smile.Here s the video via YouTube.Kimmel definitely caught Trump with a brilliantly laid out trap.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"May 26, 2016"

Denise Scott may be homeless and she may have been forgotten, even ignored by our society, but she believes in Donald J. Trump and she s not afraid to stand up and defend him.  She believes Americans need to take care of their own citizens before allowing illegal aliens to flood our country looking for handouts from our government.Denise Scott may be homeless, but she represents a portion of the silent majority in America who are sick and tired of watching politicians putting their own interests and those of special interest groups and lobbyists  before the American citizens who elected them.Denise Scott shouts angrily over the way America has forgotten her. We don t need no more illegals comin  over here!  she screams from a Skid Row sidewalk littered with chicken bones, paper plates and discarded clothes. Fix the problems in this country! I need a place to live! Christopher Mack, a lead community outreach worker for a health clinic in the heart of Los Angeles  Skid Row, squats next to her. He softly tells her to calm down, to breathe, to remember to see her case worker in the morning about housing.He also wants to know if she has health insurance.But Scott, who will turn 61 soon and has lived on Skid Row for 18 months, is in no mood to hear sweet talk. She s bone thin. Her sweater is ripped and riddled with holes. Her clothes and important papers are squashed into various size bags all around her. Tears of frustration drip down her face. I m not a racist,  she tells Mack apologetically,  But I can t go to Mexico to get a house and you can t find me a place to live here. Today is not Scott s day, Mack determines. She is too angry. Despite the fact that she and many others will qualify for health insurance by the end of the year under requirements of the Affordable Care Act, finding a place to live, not health care, is Scott s priority. So Mack will try again another time.The encounter demonstrates how difficult it can be to provide health coverage to some of the most destitute, even those who qualify for free or subsidized plans. Some of them say that simply trying to survive or find a roof over their heads takes precedence even over caring for their own health.   Daily News ",Government News,"Oct 30, 2016"
2655, WATCH: Trump Literally Accuses The Media Of Covering Up Terrorist Attacks,"Donald Trump has definitely gone off the deep end this time.Whenever a terrorist attack has occurred in this country or overseas, the media has been quick to report on it. From the attacks on 9/11 in New York, to those in Nice and Paris in France and elsewhere, the media has always kept us informed when an attack happens.Donald Trump, however, thinks terrorist attacks are happening every minute of the day and in an effort to scare people and justify his policies, such as his Muslim ban, Trump literally accused the media of covering up terrorist attacks in Europe. All over Europe it s happening,  Trump said during remarks to U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) on Monday.  It s gotten to a point where it s not even being reported. And in many cases the very, very dishonest press doesn t want to report it. They have their reasons and you understand that. Here s the video via Twitter.Trump says terror so bad  it s not even being reported. And in many cases the very, very dishonest press doesn t want to report it.  (1/2) pic.twitter.com/PUAIW9ied1  Steve Kopack (@SteveKopack) February 6, 2017This is a complete lie and the American people ought to be totally outraged by the accusation. In no way has the media ever ignored a terrorist attack in Europe. As we have personally witnessed over the last few years, the media has provided extensive coverage of attacks that occurred in Paris, Nice, and Brussels in Europe along with attacks that occurred outside of Europe in Beirut and Ankara.Trump s accusation is irresponsible and plain untrue and he is doing it as a way to gain support for his unconstitutional Muslim ban.Earlier in his remarks, Trump once again spewed delusions about the election, bragging about how the numbers prove that everyone likes him even though he lost the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes to Hillary Clinton. We had a wonderful election, didn t we?  Trump began.  And I saw those numbers   and you like me and I like you. Here s that video via Twitter.Trump begins CENTCOM remarks by saying:  We had a wonderful election, didn t we? And I saw those numbers   and you like me and I like you  pic.twitter.com/Xh8Rqfmyal  Steve Kopack (@SteveKopack) February 6, 2017It s time for the press to start punishing Trump. Media networks should no longer allow Trump surrogates to appear on television because it is clear that they are not telling the truth and are only there to spread misinformation and propaganda.CNN recently refused to have Kellyanne Conway on their programming because she has zero credibility. Every single network should follow their lead.The accusation that the press intentionally covers up terrorist attacks is outrageous and should draw a sharp rebuke and condemnation from media networks all over the world. Donald Trump is literally saying that Europe is plagued by terrorist attacks. It s the same thing as Kellyanne Conway citing a non-existent terrorist attack in Bowling Green, Kentucky. Trump and Conway are making shit up to defend the administration s bigoted agenda and they cannot be allowed to get away with it.Read more:Featured image via screenshot",News,"February 6, 2017"
15716,MOTHER OUTRAGED OVER DAUGHTER BEING ASKED TO ARRIVE NUDE TO EXAM BY RADICAL COLLEGE PROF Whose Past Includes Aiding Illegals To Cross Border Into US,"Not that anyone should be surprised by this insanity after all, it s California where rules, laws and morals don t really apply to liberals Arriving naked at a final exam is one of the most common nightmares for students, according to Psychology Today. At the University of California San Diego, however, the naked final exam is a requirement for a class in the visual arts department.Students are required to perform  a gesture that traces, outlines or speaks about your  erotic self(s),  according to the course syllabus. In the performance, all of the students are naked, along with the professor, Ricardo Dominguez, who has taught the class for 11 years. It s the standard canvas for performance art and body art,  Dominguez told local ABC News affiliate KGTV.  It is all very controlled If they are uncomfortable with this gesture, they should not take the class.  He was defending the class after one mother spoke out, claiming the requirement was not clear and was a  perversion. According to the UCSD Visual Arts department website, the course is a prerequisite for a verbal performance art class. Fully 95% of students in the class receive a grade of  A,  according to the college course ratings website koofers.com.Domniguez s biography on the department website lists a series of political efforts, including a government-funded project called the  Transborder Immigrant Tool,  in which he handed out cell phones to prospective illegal immigrants with instructions about how to cross the U.S.-Mexico border.The goal of the project, which was funded by U.S. government grants and UCSD, and which was subsequently investigated by Congress, was to use poetry to  dissolve  the border.Via: Breitbart News",politics,"May 10, 2015"
3974, Hillary Unleashes BRUTAL Rant On Trump Supporter Calling Her Husband A Rapist (VIDEO),"Hillary Clinton has had it with Donald Trump s rude, offensive supporters and the numerous intimidation tactics they try to use against her and the rest of the country.On Tuesday night, Clinton was holding a rally at Reverend Samuel Delevoe Memorial Park in Fort Lauderdale when a Trump supporter shouted,  Bill Clinton is a rapist!  over and over, disrupting her speech. As Clinton s supporters tried to drown out the Trump lover by shouting Clinton s name, the Democratic nominee reacted and went off on the protester, delivering the perfect rant while pointing right at the man. She said: You know, I am sick and tired of the negative, dark, divisive, dangerous vision and behavior from people who support Donald Trump. It is time for us to say no, we are not going backwards, we re going forward into a brighter future. The protester, who was completely unharmed during this entire incident, was taken out of the rally by security. But before he left, Clinton left the Trump supporter (and anyone else like him) with this parting wisdom: You may be angry about something, but anger is not a plan. Don t be used. Don t be exploited. You can watch Clinton unload on the Trump supporter below:The protester in the video was likely causing issues at Clinton s event not because he actually believes that her husband, former President Bill Clinton, is a rapist   but because the website InfoWars has offered to pay anyone shouting  Bill Clinton is a rapist  at a Clinton rally a hefty reward of $5,000. Yes, these are the desperate tactics conservatives are using to try to bring Clinton down as she crushed Trump in the polls. It s unfortunate and nearly pointless for them  it s costing them tons of money to continue smearing her name, and none of it is working.Featured image via Joe Raedle / Getty Images",News,"November 2, 2016"

21147,"Dear Liberal, Why I’m So Hostile…And How “Your political beliefs are a threat to liberty – not just for me, but for my three boys”","WOW! This is a powerful, must read letter that should be shared with every American Lately, I must admit that my hostility towards your political ilk has ramped up, pretty dramatically. No, it s not because we, at this point in my life, have a half-black president in the White House, and I m some closet racist who is becoming increasingly frustrated at the prospects of the White Man s power slipping through my fingers. I know that you ve accused our side of such nonsense, and the thought keeps you warm at night, but I can assure you that it is a comfortable fiction of which you should probably divest yourself.Now before I waste too much of your time, let s establish who I m talking to. If you believe that we live in an evil, imperialist nation from its founding, and you believe that it should be  fundamentally transformed , lend me your ears. If you believe that the free market is the source of the vast majority of society s ills and wish to have more government intervention into it, I m talking to you. If you believe that health care is a basic human right and that government should provide it to everyone, you re the guy I m screaming at. If you think minorities cannot possibly survive in this inherently racist country without handouts and government mandated diversity quotas, you re my guy. If you believe that rich people are that way because they ve exploited their workers and acquired wealth on the backs of the poor, keep reading. Pretty much, if you trust government more than your fellow American, this post is for you.First of all, let me say that we probably agree on more things than you think. Even between Tea Party Patriots and Occupy Wall-Streeters, I ve observed a common hatred of the insidious alliance between big business and big government. As Representative Paul Ryan (R-WI) so correctly noted, government should never be in the business of picking winners and losers in corporate America, and no person, organization, union, or corporation should have their own key to the back door of our government.Second, contrary to popular belief, conservatives really are concerned with the plight of the poor in this nation. You accuse us of being uncompassionate, hateful, racist, and greedy, but studies have shown that when it comes to charitable giving, conservatives are at least (if not more, depending on the study you read) as generous as liberals in caring for the poor. The difference between us is not in our attitude towards the problem   it s our attitude towards the solution. We believe that the government does practically nothing well (since without competition or a profit motive there is no incentive to do well) and has made the plight of the poor far worse than it would have ever been had government never gotten involved. For a stark example of this, look no farther than the condition of the black family in America since the  War on Poverty  began. You believe that more government is the answer, and that if we only throw more money at the problem, the problem will go away. We believe, as Reagan so aptly stated,Government is not the solution to our problems; government is the problem.Third, as people who might actually have to avail ourselves of a doctor s services at some point in our lives, we are just as concerned with the condition of America s healthcare system as you are. While we believe that America has the world s most capable physicians, has the world s most innovative pharmaceutical industry, and is on the cutting edge of medical technology, we also understand that the delivery system is far from perfect. However, unlike you, we see a grave danger in turning the administration of that delivery system over to the same entity that is responsible for giving us the United States Postal Service. There are private sector solutions that should certainly be explored before we kill the system, altogether, by giving it to the government to run.Now that we ve touched on a couple of points of common ground, allow me to explain my aggressiveness towards your efforts to implement your progressive agenda. First, let s talk about the word  progressive , since you now seem to prefer that word to  liberal . In order to label something as progressive or regressive, one must have some idea as to what constitutes progress. What is the ideal towards which you are striving? An idea is considered progressive if it moves us closer to the ideal and regressive if it moves us further away. So, what is your ideal society?Though I can t begin to discern the thoughts of every liberal who may read this, nor can I assume that every liberal has the same notion of an ideal society, in my arguments with liberals over the years, I couldn t help but notice the influence that FDR s Second Bill of Rights has had in shaping the beliefs of the modern liberal with regards to domestic policy. The rights that FDR cited are: The right to a useful and remunerative job in the industries or shops or farms or mines of the nation; The right to earn enough to provide adequate food and clothing and recreation; The right of every farmer to raise and sell his products at a return which will give him and his family a decent living; The right of every businessman, large and small, to trade in an atmosphere of freedom from unfair competition and domination by monopolies at home or abroad; The right of every family to a decent home; The right to adequate medical care and the opportunity to achieve and enjoy good health; The right to adequate protection from the economic fears of old age, sickness, accident, and unemployment; The right to a good education.At this point, you re probably screaming,  Right on!! , and who can blame you? What sane person in the world doesn t want everyone to be gainfully employed, adequately fed, smartly clothed, appropriately sheltered, and properly educated? These are the goals of every moral society on the planet, however we cannot ignore the fundamental question of,  At what cost? I m not sure whether FDR was a shallow thinker or simply a shrewd, Machiavellian politician, but the fact that he framed each of these ideals as a human right should be troubling to every freedom-loving person in America. After all, what does it mean for something to be a human right? Doesn t it mean that it s something to which you are entitled simply by virtue of your being human? Let s think about some of the basic rights that the real Bill of Rights delineates: freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom to petition the government, freedom to bear arms, freedom from illegal search and seizure, etc.If you re moderately intelligent and intellectually honest, you ll quickly see what separates the rights laid out in the real Bill of Rights from those laid out in FDR s misguided list   none of the rights listed above require the time, treasure, or talents of another human being.Your right to speak requires nothing from anyone else. Your right to practice your religion requires nothing from any of your fellow citizens. Your right to bear arms means that you are allowed to possess weapons to defend yourself and your family, but it makes no demand that a weapon be provided to you by anyone. A true human right is one that you possess, even if you re the only person on the entire planet   and it is unconditional.FDR s list is no  Bill of Rights . It s a list of demands. If I have a right to a job, doesn t that mean that one must be provided to me? If I have a right to adequate food, clothing, and recreation, doesn t that mean that I am entitled to those things, and someone should provide them to me? If I have an inherent right to a decent home, once again, doesn t that mean it should be provided to me, regardless of my ability to afford one or build one for myself?You might protest that FDR only meant that we have the right to pursue those things, but that s not what he said, and why would he? If we live in a free society, our right to pursue those things is self-evident, is it not? Besides, if he only believed in our right to pursue those things, he would not have felt the need to implement the New Deal.You may be getting anxious, now, wondering what FDR s Second Bill of Rights has to do with my antipathy towards your political philosophy. It s quite simple   your political beliefs are a threat to liberty   not just for me, but for my three boys and their children as well. I care much less about the America that I m living in at this very moment than I do about the one that I m leaving Nathaniel, Charlie, and Jackson.How does your political bent threaten my and my sons personal liberty, you ask? In your irrational attempt to classify things such as clothing, shelter, health care, employment, and income as basic human rights, you are placing a demand upon my time, my treasure, and my talents. If you believe that you have a right to health care, and you are successful in persuading enough shallow thinkers to think as you do, then it will place a demand upon me to provide it to you. If you believe that you have a right to a job, and more than half of America agrees with you, as a business owner, I am obligated to provide one to you, even if it means making my business less profitable.The fact is, you can rail against my conservatism all you wish. You can make fun of my Tea Party gatherings, and you can ridicule patriots in tri-corner hats until you wet yourself from mirth, but one thing is for certain: my political philosophy will NEVER be a threat to your freedom. If you feel a burning responsibility to the poor, conservatism will never prevent you from working 80 hours per week and donating all of your income to charity. If you feel a strong sense of pity for a family who cannot afford health insurance, my political philosophy will never prevent you from purchasing health insurance for this family or raising money to do so, if you cannot afford it, personally. If you are moved with compassion for a family who is homeless, a conservative will never use the police power of government to prevent you from taking that family in to your own home or mobilizing your community to build one for them.However, you cannot say the same for liberalism. If I choose not to give to the poor for whatever reason, you won t simply try to persuade me on the merits of the idea   you will seek to use the government as an instrument of plunder to force me to give to the poor. If we are walking down the street together and we spot a homeless person, using this logic, you would not simply be content with giving him $20 from your own pocket   you would hold a gun to my head and force me to give him $20, as well.Everything that modern liberalism accomplishes is accomplished at the barrel of a government rifle. You do not trust in the generosity of the American people to provide, through private charity, things such as clothing, food, shelter, and health care, so you empower the government to take from them and spend the money on wasteful, inefficient, and inadequate government entitlement programs. You do not trust in the personal responsibility of the average American to wield firearms in defense of themselves and their families, so you seek to empower the government to criminalize the use and possession of firearms by private citizens. Everytime you empower the government, you lose more of your personal liberty   it s an axiomatic truth.What angers me the most about you is the eagerness with which you allow the incremental enslavement to occur. You are the cliched and proverbial frog in the pot who has actually convinced himself that he s discovered a big, silver jacuzzi. Somehow, you re naive enough to believe that one more degree of heat won t really matter that much.I have the utmost respect for a slave who is continuously seeking a path to freedom. What I cannot stomach is a free man who is continuous seeking a path to servitude by willingly trading his freedom for the false sense of security that government will provide.I am reminded of Samuel Adams  impassioned speech where he stated: If ye love wealth (or security) better than liberty, the tranquillity of servitude than the animating contest of freedom,   go from us in peace. We ask not your counsels or arms. Crouch down and lick the hands which feed you. May your chains sit lightly upon you, and may posterity forget that ye were our countrymen!  Servitude can exist in a free society, but freedom cannot exist in a slave nation. In a free country, you have the liberty to join with others of your political ilk and realize whatever collectivist ideals you can dream up. You can start your own little commune where the sign at the front gate says,  From each according to his ability; to each according to his need , and everyone can work for the mutual benefit of everyone else. In my society, you have the freedom to do that.In your society, I don t have the same freedom. If your collectivism offends me, I am not free to start my own free society within its borders. In order for collectivism to work, everyone must be on board, even those who oppose it   why do you think there was a Berlin Wall?In conclusion, just know that the harder you push to enact your agenda, the more hostile I will become   the harder I will fight you. It s nothing personal, necessarily. If you want to become a slave to an all-powerful central government, be my guest. But if you are planning to take me and my family down with you, as we say down here in the South, I will stomp a mud-hole in your chest and walk it dry.Bring it.Jeremy N.

256," SLC Cops Murder Crying Suspect, Shoot Him In The Back AND Taser Him Without Even Pursuing","On Sunday, August 13th, Salt Lake City Police seemed to have a routine bicycle stop under control. Patrick Harmon, a 50-year-old black man who was pulled over on his bike for riding without a working taillight at night, was standing on the side of the road with officers complying with their requests. Officer Clinton Fox asked Harmon if he knew about his warrants, which Harmon answered in the affirmative. Harmon was in tears throughout the encounter.Then, as Harmon finished removing his backpack as Officer Fox requested, he decided he was too scared of jail to stay. He got loose of the straps of his pack and ran.Did Clinton Fox, fellow human being, decide to run after Patrick Harmon? Not on your life. Or more precisely, not on Patrick s. One assumes that Fox, being a police officer, was in far superior shape to the middle-aged man smoking a cigarette only moments before, but rather than expend the energy it would ve required to run his suspect down on foot   like police do every damn day   he instead chose to draw his service weapon and fire three shots into Harmon s back as he ran. His finger was already pulling the trigger the first time by the moment he shouted  I m gonna fuckin  shoot you! Harmon s sobbing can be heard as he lies prone on the sidewalk. The light of another officer s taser, which had been at the ready well before Officer Fox shot Harmon in the back, circles around Patrick s heaving body. I got  im,  says Officer Fox.The DA would later say that the shooting was  legally justified,  before the body camera footage you re about to see was released. The police report would alternately first say that Harmon was on foot, then on a bike. It would say that he had a gun, then it was changed to a knife. His rap sheet was public long before the footage.Patrick s sister Antoinette drove 1,300 miles to join the rally held by Black Lives Matter organizer Lex Scott to demand the release of the body cam video. Ms. Scott has held many such rallies. This is about accountability and transparency. This is about Patrick Harmon s family deserving to see that footage. If [SLCPD] did nothing wrong, wouldn t they have released the footage by now? Now the footage has been released, and it is damning.Will Officer Fox face consequences for the apparent murder of Patrick Harmon? The shooting, by any metric, is certainly not justified. Will the DA withdraw their statements? Will the SLCPD form a tight ring around their comrade, squeezing out truth and transparency?Let s hope this incident breaks the pattern and there is accountability.THE FOLLOWING FOOTAGE IS GRAPHIC AND SHOWS THE SHOOTING OF PATRICK HARMONFeatured image via George Frey/Getty Images",News,"October 5, 2017"
7722, DOZENS Of GOP Foreign Policy Experts Pledge To Stop Trump From Winning Nomination,"Over sixty GOP national security buffs have taken a pledge to work  energetically  and do whatever it takes to stop Republican front runner Donald Trump from becoming the party s nominee for president.This colossal promise was released late Wednesday via an open letter signed by several different foreign policy experts who sincerely feel (along with the rest of us) that Trump s vision of America is  wildly inconsistent and unmoored in principle.  In the letter, the concerned GOPers warned that if given the chance, President Trump would  make America less safe  and  diminish our standing in the world. The letter, in part, reads: Mr. Trump s own statements lead us to conclude that as president, he would use the authority of his office to act in ways that make America less safe, and which would diminish our standing in the world.Furthermore, his expansive view of how presidential power should be wielded against his detractors poses a distinct threat to civil liberty in the United States.As committed and loyal Republicans, we are unable to support a Party ticket with Mr. Trump at its head. We commit ourselves to working energetically to prevent the election of someone so utterly unfitted to the office. The letter was organized by former State Department official Eliot Cohen and former Mitt Romney adviser Bryan McGrath and was published by national security news site War on the Rocks as the GOP reached a record-high panic after Trump s success on Super Tuesday. Cohen said of the letter, This is really drawing a bright moral line and saying that if we re going to keep our souls we can t cross it. The letter is 454 words long, with signers blasting Trump for his  expansive use of torture,  his  hateful, anti-Muslim rhetoric,  and his not-so-subtle crush on Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump s proposal to make Mexico build a wall on its border also came under fire, as did his suggestion that Japan pay for military protection, stating that Trump was more like a  racketeer  than an ally.Max Boot, a foreign policy adviser to Mitt Romney s 2012 campaign and one of the letter s signers, said: I would sooner work for (North Korean dictator) Kim Jong Un than for Donald Trump. I think Donald Trump is objectively more dangerous than Kim Jong Un and not as stable. By refusing to support the Republican ticket if Trump is the party s nomination, these 60+ signers are waiving any possibility that they would obtain a high-level position with the Trump administration. McGrath stated that this open letter didn t necessarily mean that the signers would be voting for a Democratic president, but noted that some of his colleagues said they had no other choice.

3000, Scottish Newspaper Hilariously Trolls Trump Inauguration With PERFECT TV Guide Description (IMAGE),"The Scots are geniuses when it comes to trolling Donald Trump. And this newspaper proves it.Sadly, Donald Trump s inauguration is on Friday and it is likely going to be an event that offends millions of Americans across the country as Trump makes the day all about him and attacking his critics.Trump s team has been desperate to find musical talent willing to sell their souls to Satan to sing for Trump and have only managed to get a reality show singer and a has-been band to commit.Furthermore, a massive protest against Trump has also been planned to occur at the same time. All in all, Trump s inauguration is going to be a shit show that ushers in a frightening period in American history that will impact this nation for generations as Republicans try to turn it into their own utopia where rich people and tyrants flourish while the rest of humanity suffers immeasurably.All the progress made over the last 150 years is about to go down the drain and one Scottish newspaper could only describe Trump s inauguration as the return of  The Twilight Zone. The Sunday Herald describes this newest  Twilight Zone  episode as  one of the most ambitious, expensive and controversial productions in broadcast history  featuring four years of answers to the question of what would have happened if the Nazis had won World War II.Calling the event  nightmarish,  the Sunday Herald goes on to say that Americans were unbelievably duped to make Donald Trump president. This huge virtual reality project, which will unfold on TV, in the press, and on Twitter over the next four years sets out to build on an alternative present. The story begins in a nightmarish version of 2017 in which huge sections of the US electorate have somehow been duped into voting to make Donald Trump president. It sounds far-fetched, and it is,  the description continues,  but as it goes on it becomes more and more chillingly plausible. Today s feature length opener concentrates on the gaudy inauguration of President Trump, and the stirrings of protest and despair surrounding the ceremony It s a flawed piece, but a disturbing glimpse of the horrors we could stumble into, if we re not careful.

8771, Ted ‘Duck Hunter’ Cruz Goes Full Camo In BIZARRE New Ad Pandering To Idiot America (VIDEO),"Politicians have been known to do a lot of things to get elected. They usually cater and pander to a group of people who they think will have the best chance at casting a vote in their favor. In the case of Republican presidential candidate Senator Ted Cruz, those he s decided to cater to are the residents of Idiot America.Cruz has decided to go all in trying to get the ultra-religious, absent from reality, guns and God group of folks who love to hunt, hate gay people and live far away from populated areas. People otherwise known as extreme, right-wing Republicans.Perfectly pandering to this demographic, Cruz paired himself up with Duck Dynasty and their bigot-in-chief Phil Robertson. Robertson is about as anti-gay and bigoted as one could ever hope to be, so of course he s now endorsed one of the leading bigot candidates running for president   Ted Cruz.In a new campaign commercial for Cruz, Robertson, with his face painting black camo for hunting, tells everyone the qualifications he wants to see in a president: Is he or she godly? Does he or she love us? Can he or she do the job? And finally, would they kill a duck and put  em in a pot and make up a good duck gumbo? I ve looked at the candidates. Ted Cruz is my man. (Let s just pause for a second and acknowledge that Robertson said  he or she.  Got to at least give credit where credit is due)Now, as far as Cruz being the man for the job of President of the United States? Yeah, not so much. He s a smarmy man who will say or do anything to get his way. This includes, but is not limited to, likely not even being as religious as he says he is, or as  constitutional  as he claims to be.Cruz tends to do things for show, and no greater example of this can be seen than in this very commercial where he puts on blackface, pardon me, hunting camo paint that looks remarkably like blackface and someone should have told him that, and sits down to hold his gun and  hunt  with Robertson.Cruz is all like,  Look at me! I m just like you! I like to hunt and play make-believe Rambo, too! Ignore the fact that I m insanely wealthy and married to Goldman Sachs! Vote for me!  He knows exactly what he is doing. He s a smart guy, gotta give him that much, which also makes him irrefutably dangerous. He knows how to play the game, get what he wants, and he doesn t seem to care who might get hurt along the way.However, this ad right here, as funny as it may be, because it s pretty goddamn funny, also show to the depths he ll go to cater to a specific voter population. In this case, idiot America. Video/Featured image: YouTube",News,"January 14, 2016"
3809, Trump’s Latest Tweets Prove He’s Going To Be The WORST President We’ve Ever Had (IMAGES),"Most of the people with brains in this country knew that Donald Trump, a reality television star, was not fit to be the next President of the United States and should not be allowed anywhere near the White House. Unfortunately, Trump was able to rile up enough hate and divisiveness in this country to get himself elected, but he s already proving that he s going to be a disastrous Commander-in-chief.No one has to look any further than Trump s Twitter account to understand how much of a mistake electing him was. Despite the fact that he promised he would be restrained on social media, Trump is incapable of changing. And instead of getting to work and laying out his vision for the country, he spent several hours on Sunday attacking The New York Times. Are you embarrassed for America? You should be.Here s how our thin-skinned President-elect went after a top newspaper:Twitter(It s worth mentioning that although Trump continues to deny that he ever said Japan should have nukes, he most certainly did say that.)But seriously, Presidents who actually do their job don t spend hours on Twitter attacking the free press. They don t have time, and they have more important things to focus on   things that go beyond what Trump is capable of handling.The New York Times didn t hesitate to call Trump out on his lies:TwitterWe re proud of our election coverage & we will continue to  hold power to account.  Here s what we told our employees & our subscribers: pic.twitter.com/dcaTrAS4mU  NYTCo Communications (@NYTimesComm) November 13, 2016It s safe to say that Trump didn t actually believe he was going to win the election, and he s miserable now that he has.

15939,FBI and DOJ Refusing To Comply With Subpoena Over Trump Dossier…Hello Jeff Sessions?,"Hello Jeff Sessions! Where is the DOJ s leader these days? Something tells us the Trump Dossier will end up being the bombshell that exposes Comey, Brennan and Clapper and all of the other criminals who used this dossier to spy on Trump. Obama used the dossier to spy on Trump!Anyone who followed the Obama White House intel policy outcomes will know that DNI Clapper and CIA Director John Brennan were the two primary political operatives weaponizing intelligence.But it gets better Comey comes into play:Remember the bombshell testimony of the Hermitage Capital CEO where the origin of the Fusion GPS  Russian Dossier  was discussed? CEO Browder stated the Russian government paid Fusion GPS to create the Steele propaganda dossier on candidate Donald Trump. That same dossier was used by the FBI in June/July 2016 to generate the FISA surveillance warrants against the Trump campaign. BOMBSHELL: Comey was using propaganda commissioned by Russia, funded in part by the FBI, to attack Trump, as the framework to launch his FBI investigation into candidate Donald Trump and Russian collusion.CEO BROWDER S ADMISSION BELOW:This is getting good.What does Nunes do now after several attempts at getting documents related to the dossier?After two previous deadlines came and went, House Intelligence Committee chairman Devin Nunes has set a new date for the FBI and Justice Department to turn over documents relating to the Trump dossier.Nunes originally subpoenaed the FBI and Justice on Aug. 24, demanding dossier documents by Sept. 1. When none were produced, Nunes agreed to extend the deadline to September 14. During that time, arrangements were made for intelligence committee investigators to visit the Justice Department to make sure officials on both sides understood precisely which documents the committee seeks.No documents were produced by Sept. 14, and now Nunes, apparently unsatisfied with the results of the staff meeting, has sent a new letter to FBI Director Christopher Wray and Attorney General Jeff Sessions. In it, Nunes set a deadline of this Friday for the documents to be produced. If the documents are not produced by then, Nunes directed that Wray and Sessions appear in an open committee hearing Sept. 28, to explain why they did not hand over the materials.The document request in the original Aug. 24 subpoena has not changed. It focuses on the FBI s relations with Christopher Steele, the former British spy retained by the American opposition research firm Fusion GPS to dig dirt on Donald Trump in Russia as part of an effort funded by wealthy supporters of Hillary Clinton. Among other things, the original subpoena demanded all internal FBI reports  incorporating, relying on, or referring to  information provided by Steele, his sources, or Fusion GPS.The original subpoena also asked for  any information, if it exists, provided by Mr. Steele as an informant/source (confidential or otherwise) or in any other capacity,  as well as any documents relating to whether the FBI paid or offered any benefits to Steele. The subpoena also asked for all documents relating to FBI and Justice  efforts to corroborate, validate, or evaluate  information provided by Steele.Finally, the original subpoena requested any court applications for surveillance that included any information provided by Steele, plus any court orders, if there were any, that were based in any part on Steele s information.So far, the FBI and Justice Department have not provided the information. Now, they have a new deadline.Read more: WE",Government News,"Sep 20, 2017"
15737,[VIDEO] BALTIMORE MAYOR TO POLICE: “Let them loot…it’s only property” Police Demoralized After Being Unable To Respond To 9-11 Calls From Terrorized Business Owners,"The radical Baltimore mayor who ordered the Baltimore Police Department to stand down is now calling for a federal investigation into the Baltimore Police Department. What about a federal investigation into her reckless actions that were clearly motivated by her desire to side with the rioters?? Are we living in some alternate universe where all ability to reason and to use common sense has been removed from our society?Baltimore s streets will likely take years   if not decades   to recover after April s riots that left scores of business owners devastated and local police disheartened. Many cops feel  demoralized, hung out to dry and abandoned,  Fox News  Leland Vittert reported on  Hannity  Monday. There s a sentiment here of  why bother showing up?  Vittert added. Vittert was on the scene at what used to be  ground zero  for the rioting and said he had not seen a single police car during the time he was there. The area is known for drug dealings and gang activity, according to Vittert. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan said more than 200 businesses were destroyed in the riots, Fox reported.  So this was your life savings you put into this?  Vittert asked a business owner whose property was destroyed. Exactly, exactly,  the business owner said. He added that his life s work was demolished in 30 minutes by looters and vandals resulting in more than $30,000 worth of damage. Vitter talked to a pharmacy owner who said 99 percent of his store s shelves were ransacked and fears the prescription drugs are now out on the streets.  There were dozens of businesses that were looted, and what was stunning to the business owners themselves is as the looting was going on, they were calling 911,  Vittert said. And, as we have reported, the police did nothing because they had an order from the mayor to  let them loot. It s only property.  Business owners are now faced with the difficult decision of whether to rebuild as they worry they will not be protected from future crime and violence.Via: BizPacReview",politics,"May 6, 2015"

Americans are dead because of these storms and the resulting floods.I ll say that again. People are dead.But that isn t stopping Trump from using the storms to promote his tax reform policy, a policy that would mostly benefit the wealthy while slashing the very revenues that contribute to paying for a strong Coast Guard, a prepared FEMA, and the organizations that predict and track hurricanes.On his Twitter Wednesday morning, Trump urged Congress to begin work on tax reform.The approval process for the biggest Tax Cut & Tax Reform package in the history of our country will soon begin. Move fast Congress!  Donald J.

Trump is already growing the deficit that had been shrinking under President Obama. Now he wants it to skyrocket with tax cuts that won t do a damn thing to help this country. All such tax cuts will do is further strangle already cash-strapped government agencies like FEMA that Americans need more than ever.What this country needs most is higher taxes on the wealthy, not lower.Trump should be ashamed of himself for using these two tragedies to push his greedy tax plan.

4378," Last Republican Reagan TRASHES GOP, Says Nancy Would Have Voted For Hillary Clinton","When you ve lost the support of the whole Reagan family, you re pretty much done for.

22533,"THOUGHT POLICE: US Border Control Wants to Study Your Facebook, Twitter Accounts","Patrick Henningsen 21st Century WireIf this latest proposal from the US becomes policy, it could be a major watershed point for the globalized police state, allowing governments to not only to profile you, but also to target and even exclude individuals based on their online speech and activity. This week we learned that US border control have been running a shadow  test  program behind the scenes, where travelers into the US are asked to declare their  online presence , including any social media accounts and associated blogs.The US Federal Register states,  Collecting social media data will enhance the existing investigative process and provide Department of Homeland Security (DHS) greater clarity and visibility to possible nefarious activity and connections by providing an additional tool set which analysts and investigators may use to better analyze and investigate the case. In the hive mind of the state, the term nefarious is proven to be a flexible one, and could encompass persons of any political or intellectual persuasion who travel internationally. Where does it end?So who are these arbiters of political thought and social discourse?According to this recent report by The Guardian, the  deciders  are likely to be hourly wage earners working for the TSA, or contractors working under the banner of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Initially, these workers would be tasked with analyzing your  online presence : US Customs and Border Protection s proposed change would add a line on both the online and paper forms of the visa application form that visitors to the US must fill out if they do not have a visa and are planning on staying for up to 90 days.The following question would be added to both the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (Esta) and I-94W forms:  Please enter information associated with your online presence Provider/Platform Social media identifier. Thus far, the DHS claim they are only running a limited  pilot program , one which the agency is keeping confidential and out of the public eye. Officials claim that the secrecy surrounding this controversial program is because they don t want to reveal their methods for identifying a potential  terror threat.  Millions of visitors disembark in US each week (Photo: Flickr user Tom May via Fast Company)In practical terms, with 10 million visa applications and over 77 million visitors annually   what we are really seeing here is a giant  big data  capturing exercise that will quickly generate an additional column on your personal database   sitting alongside your standard personal, facial recognition and other biometric ID information, as well as your travel history, and anchored by the RFID chip already embedded in most international passports.How the DHS expects its border control staff to properly vet and verify the information in question before a traveler passes through border security is hard to ascertain. The potential for misinformation is ever present.Eventually, processing this amount of data will probably be farmed out to high speed intelligent, or A.I. computer systems. Similar high-end, algorithm-based analytical surveillance programs like PRISM is already being used by US and UK government agencies to trawl through masses of public online activity, so it only stands to reason that A.I. will eventually perform the job of flagging-up any undesirables.If you went by the US media rhetoric you d think that Facebook and Twitter were the number one causes of global terrorism. No surprise then, that the battle cry for this latest DHS program has to be last December s apparent  ISIS-inspired terrorist event  in San Bernardino, and the subsequent controversy over the FBI s ability access to one of the suspect s encrypted iPhone 5C.What s more likely to be driving this grand security directive is not necessarily some effective plan to  keep people safe , but rather, highly lucrative commercial interests.CIA is investing in firms that specialize in sifting through social media postshttps://t.co/nDVBvKt0bz pic.twitter.com/jiWZgQhYDX  RT America (@RT_America) April 15, 2016No Private SpacesPerhaps the most troubling aspect of this story has to do with assessing the relationship between the individual and the government and the expectation of privacy in a so-called democratic or  free  society.In this instance, the government is adopting a blanket policy of judging a person as  guilty until proven innocent.  By ceding this expectation to the government, an individual consenting to this arrangement by forgoing his or her right to privacy and due process. As history shows us time and time again, once you give this away, it s very difficult to get back.In a BBC interview this week, Joseph Lorenzo Hall, chief technologist at the Centre for Democracy and Technology points out one of the fundamental flaws in the government s new regime, as he explains: It s very hard to see travellers not filling out this item   even though it s optional   as they may fear not getting entry into the country. Democracy in general requires having spaces free from government scrutiny and increasingly social life happens online.   We would have a poor society if people were chilled from participating in social activity online so I really hope they rethink this. Now many Americans might look at this story and think,  This doesn t affect me, it s only for foreigners.  While that may seem true on the surface, the reality is that this DHS system is designed for Americans too. Consider it phase one. Besides this, do not be surprised if whatever rights you deny your neighbor, will eventually be denied of you too.This is what technocracy looks like   it s brutal, unforgiving, and ultimately unresponsive to common sense and reason. Worst of all, it pretends to be driven by a perceived public interest in safety and security, but in reality the only security that s ever achieved through such measures   are secure profits for a select number of corporate firms fortunate enough to win corporate contracts in the ever-expanding security theatre that is Homeland Security.

But agents also said they ve identified several danger zones outside the stadium they re going to protect as well, CBS News reported. It s the lone wolf,  Harp said.  It s the individual who is self-radicalized that creates a problem that you can t detect. There s only so much the FBI can do with regard to surveillance within the guidelines of the Constitution. If someone were to use a drone to disperse something,  he said, CBS News reported,  it could be a potentially hazardous situation. Given that his beloved Chicago Bears were pretty much out of contention on the first week of the regular season, President Barack Obama hasn t really paid that much attention to the Super Bowl. That doesn t mean other people aren t, though   including the savages of the Islamic State group.An FBI bulletin claimed there was a significant threat to this year s Super Bowl 50   being held on Feb. 7 at Levi s Stadium in Santa Clara, California   from terrorist groups. There s going to be law enforcement secreted around the stadium that you are not going to see or know about. They are there,  retired FBI Assistant Special Agent In Charge Jeffrey Harp told reporters. If the fiber optic cables get cut, it impacts financial institutions, impacts Silicon Valley, it impacts a lot of infrastructure in that area,  Harp added.Several attacks have already been carried out against fiber optic systems in the Bay Area, disrupting Silicon Valley s extensive tech industry.

661, This State Is Honoring Obama And Sending A Middle Finger To Trump At The Same Time – You Can Bet He’ll Be Fuming,"President Obama s home state of Illinois has passed a bill honoring him by designating his birthday August 4 as a state holiday. So now, every year on August 4, Illinois has a state holiday known as  Barack Obama Day.  While Illinois has a Democratic supermajority in its general assembly, bills must still be signed into law by the governor, and Illinois  governor is a Republican.Once known as  Senate Bill 55,  it reads: [Barack Obama Day] observed throughout the State as a day set apart to honor the 44th President of the United States of America who began his career serving the People of Illinois in both the Illinois State Senate and the United States Senate, and dedicated his life to protecting the rights of Americans and building bridges across communities. They re also renaming a large chunk of I-55, running from just southwest of the city of Chicago to near Bloomington-Normal, in the center of the state. That will become the  Barack Obama Presidential Expressway. That may well rankle Donald Trump and his supporters, who insist that Obama was the worst thing ever to happen to this country. Trump spent a lot of time on Obama s case for his vacations, which is one of the most hypocritical things he does. He also falsely accused Obama of tapping his phones in Trump Tower, and Trump has been steadily working to dismantle everything Obama ever did.Trump has claimed he s the most presidential president this country has ever had with the possible exception of Abraham Lincoln, and he says he s already gotten more done than FDR. Except, you know, he s gotten zilch done and he s a man-baby on Twitter. He politicized his speech to the Boy Scouts, where he again bragged about himself and actually got the audience to boo Obama.Would New York give Trump a holiday? Probably not, since he lost that state last year and they aren t exactly fond of him there. But who cares about Illinois, right? That state only produced both Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan   two heroes of a Republican Party that s desperate for new heroes.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,"August 5, 2017"
5786, Conservatives Who Think The GOP-Led Senate Preserved Gun Rights Need To Read This NOW,"A mother s heart-wrenchingly true Facebook post is going viral following yesterday s Senate vote on gun legislation, despite her having written it just a few days after the Orlando massacre. To put it bluntly, Senate Republicans have a bad habit of saying they re voting for law abiding gun owners, and for gun owners  rights, when they vote down gun legislation. They aren t. They re voting against children   even extremely young children. Innocent children. American children. Their children and grandchildren. Politicians   take a look. This is your child, your children, your grandchildren, your great grand children and future generations to come. They will live their lives and grow up in this world based on your decisions. They are barely 3 and they will hide in bathroom stalls standing on top of toilet seats. I do not know what will be harder for them? Trying to remain quiet for an extended amount of time or trying to keep their balance without letting a foot slip below the stall door? Stacey Wehrman Feeley took a picture of her three-year old daughter standing on top of their toilet, and she originally thought this was simply the hijinks of a young child and she wanted to show her husband. Then her daughter told her what she was really doing: She was practicing for lockdown drills at her school.An innocent three-year old is practicing for lockdown drills. Why should a three-year old even have to worry about gun violence at her school, or anywhere else?That prompted the long Facebook post that contains the above paragraph, but that s not all she said. Feeley also said: No one thinks gun control will be 100% crime control. But maybe, just maybe, it helps 1% or 2% or 50%? Who knows unless we try? Why on earth are there not universal background checks? Where is a universal registration database? Why are high capacity magazines ever permitted to be sold to anyone other than direct to the military? Is that really necessary to protect yourself or hunt for that matter? What about smart guns, where are they? That is the question, isn t it? Republicans tend to parrot the NRA s line that these measures won t stop criminals or terrorists, so we shouldn t enact them at all. Democrats, too, do that to some degree, but not the way Republicans do. CNN called yesterday s votes  tough election year politics,  and mentioned longstanding disputes over what would be effective. Sadly, they re correct when they say this was expected.There s a reason the GOP is called  the Party of No.  They d rather do nothing at all than piss off their handlers, all while manipulating and controlling language to sound like they re the good guys.What Feeley is saying isn t,  I have the solution.  It s  We need to start somewhere, and all these ideas have been on and off the table for years. Why has nothing been done?  And that s the question that all our politicians need to start answering. It s also a question that the NRA needs to start answering, since they re among the loudest  more guns  voices out there.The face that politicians particularly members of the Party of No need to see isn t just the face of the victims in Orlando, or the victims of shootings that already happened. It s the children who have to live in a world where they aren t safe anywhere, even at home, because Congress patently refuses to even try.Read her full post below:Featured image via embedded Facebook post",News,"June 21, 2016"
10841,CROOKED HILLARY CLINTON’S Latest Speech To Be Crashed By Angry HAITIANS Pushing For Answers,"Hillary Clinton always goes back to the black community and this is just another case of pandering. It s pretty sickening that she s even being asked to speak at a college commencement ANY college commencement! The Clinton GRIFTERS also owe the Haitian community answers on where money went after the Haiti earthquake relief effort.  The Haitian community is up in arms over much that happened after the 2010 earthquake. This should be interesting:Here is how the Clinton s used the money that Americans donated to help the devastated residents of Haiti to enrich themselves:On June 8, Hillary Clinton is scheduled to serve as the Class of 2017 commencement speaker at Medgar Evers College in Brooklyn, New York, where she will also be awarded an honorary degree. The announcement has incited protests from several members of the Haitian community who plan to protest the speech and are pushing the college s president, Rudy Crew, to rescind the invitation.PANDERING TO THE BLACK COMMUNITY IN TIMES OF TROUBLE: Every time the Clintons get in a bind, they run to the black community to whitewash their tarnished image,  said Komokoda, the Haitian group protesting the speech, in a statement.  After Bill Clinton was impeached for lying under oath in the Monica Lewinsky affair, he brought in Jesse Jackson and a host of black preachers to lead prayers with him at the White House. To divert attention from her  deleted emails  debacle, Hillary had Bill DeBlasio s wife, Chirlane McCray, bring her to Brownsville, one of the most impoverished neighborhoods in Brooklyn, for a photo op with little black children. When newspaper editorials and cartoons were blasting her for her unending lies and demanding investigations and prosecutions, former New York City mayor David Dinkins brought her out for a keynote speech at his Dinkins Leadership & Public Policy Forum at Columbia University. Today, for her resurrection from a shameful defeat by the last person most reasonable people felt could ever be president of the United States, the dirty work falls to Rudy Crew. HAITI RELIEF SCAM   QUESTIONS REMAIN:The Clintons  role in Haiti has incited immense criticism and has tarnished their relationship with the Haitian community. In 2010, Haiti suffered a massive earthquake. Several NGOs and the United Nations flocked to Haiti to help relief efforts, but their intervention came with several costs. In 2011, UN Peacekeepers caused a massive cholera outbreak that killed at least 9,500 people and sickened 800,000 others. During this time, Bill Clinton served as the United Nations Special Envoy to Haiti while Hillary Clinton served as secretary of state. While the Clinton Foundation has staunchly defended their role in Haiti, their involvement in the country has been far from successful.  Many of the most notable investments the Clintons helped launch, such as the new Marriott in the capital, have primarily benefited wealthy foreigners and the island s ruling elite, who needed little help to begin with,  wrote Jonathan Katz for Politico in 2015.For Komokoda and many Haitians, the Clintons epitomize NGOs and corporations exploiting the crisis and relief efforts in Haiti for their own gain. Haitians also blame the Clintons for the controversial rule of former Haitian President Michel Martelly, who stepped down in February 2016 due to his record of corruption after the Clintons helped him get elected in 2010.MORE ON THE CLINTON FOUNDATION SCAM ON HAITI:Read more: Observer",politics,"May 19, 2017"
8792, Kim Davis Utters Four Words To Describe Obama’s Speech – Gets Burned Alive For It (VIDEO),"Rowan county clerk Kim Davis already had her five minutes of fame; her time is over and done with. Or is it? At, least, it was until some Republican by the name of Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) gave tickets to President Obama s last State of the Union address to the Family Research Council, who then, in turn, gave the exclusive rights to one of the tickets to Mrs. Davis.Now, unfortunately, her five minutes of fame has been extended to six minutes. Heck, we wouldn t even grant her that right if she wasn t one of the top trending topics in the internet chatter world Tuesday night. But, the reality is, she is. For some reason, people can t get enough of Kim Davis   she must have all the makings of a star.A reporter caught up with Davis after Obama concluded his last remarks for the night, and uttered just four words of what she thought about her experience: It was a speech.

But, hey, what else do you expect coming from the mouth of Kim Davis? Here is a suggestion for Kim, in four words:  just do your job.In all fairness, the internet was much harsher to her than her characterization of the president s speech ever was, and it s not even close. While it s never a good thing to be mean, she must have known a good roasting was coming her way.Here are a few of the top (and funniest) comments she received on the internet after so brazenly deciding to show her face on the most important day in politics.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Uproxx.Pic via Uproxx.Pic via Uproxx.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.What can we say? Kim keeps showing up in the limelight and we, as a people, continue taking the bait. She may not be relevant, but she sure is a target   no one can disagree with that. Her facial expressions were probably some of the most scrutinized, right up there with Speaker of the House Paul Ryan. He appeared virtually emotionless throughout the entire speech, with a few slight movements here and there. It was almost like there was an unannounced contest between him and Kim Davis on who could appear to be the least interested in whatever the president was saying.

6180, Donald Trump And Bernie Sanders Agree To Debate Before California’s Primaries,"Jimmy Kimmel landed a rare, on-air appearance from Donald Trump on the May 25th edition of his show, and wasted no part of the segment in grilling Trump on everything. Possibly the most interesting twist, however, came when Kimmel read a question from Bernie Sanders, who will be tonight s guest on  Jimmy Kimmel Live.  The question? Hillary Clinton backed out of an agreement to debate me in California before the June 7th primary. Are you prepared to debate the major issues facing our largest state and the country prior to the California primary? Trump, ever the attention-whore, replied with something surprisingly philanthropic: Yes, I am. How much is he going to pay me? Because if I debated him, we would have such high ratings and I think I should take that money and give it to some worthy charity. If he paid a nice sum for a charity I would love to do that. Trump later said that whatever network picked it up could donate the money to charity for this debate.The Sanders campaign wasted absolutely no time in responding to Trump on this:Game on. I look forward to debating Donald Trump in California before the June 7 primary.  Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) May 26, 2016This would be a truly interesting debate, especially given that primary season isn t over yet, despite all expectations that both nominations would be locked up by now. There have already been so many monkey wrenches thrown into the primaries that one would think nobody would notice this one. However, one would be very wrong   this could throw the biggest monkey wrench yet into the works, depending on how the two candidates interacted with each other and the moderators in such a setting.As of the time of this posting, there was no formal arrangement to actually hold this debate, and setting it up could be a logistical nightmare for the campaigns. That could change quickly, though, depending largely on whether the networks see any potential in it. Honestly, they d be idiotic not to want to do it. It s hard to imagine that anybody in the country wouldn t want to see these two put their arguments side-by-side in a debate format.As Bernie said,  Game on.

7193, Israeli Minister Calls For ‘Civil Targeted Killing’ Of Human Rights Activists Leading Boycott Of Israel (VIDEO),"In Israel, dehumanizing Palestinians and calling for their destruction has become the norm. Only a few days after Chief Israeli Sephardi Rabbi Yitzhak Yosef said that non-Jews should not live in Israel unless they  serve Jews, another influential Israeli racist has come out publicly, in this case to incite against Palestinians and their supporters. Transportation minister Israel Katz called for the  civil targeted killing of non-violent civil rights leaders who call for the boycott, divestment, and sanctioning of Israel until it conforms to international law.Here is what author Richard Silverstein had to say about Katz s statement, made in Hebrew: The phrase he used (sikul ezrahi memukad) derives from the euphemistic Hebrew phrase for the targeted killing of a terrorist (the literal meaning is  targeted thwarting ).  But the added word  civil  makes it something different. Katz is saying that we won t physically murder BDS opponents, but we will do everything short of that. One may rightly ask what business a transportation minister has conducting targeted killings, physical or otherwise, against anyone.  Though everything in Israel is in service to the national security state, has transportation fallen under that bailiwick as well? We are entering dangerous territory when an Israeli cabinet minister engages in wordplay that verges on putting a bull s-eye on the backs of non-violent activists.  If there are Israel apologists out there who dismiss the significance of such rhetoric they are sadly mistaken.  In this torrid political environment in which Israeli leftists have become criminals and wounded Palestinian youth may be summarily executed in the street,  it is only too easy to forsee Palestinian activists like Barghouti (BDS leader) having a bounty on their heads. In addition, BDS activists this psychopath is inciting against are not just Palestinian: They are from all over the world, including the United States. In fact, American activists are at the forefront of the BDS movement. Moreover, we want to keep in mind the life and death power Israel has over the Palestinian people. It has become the norm not only to incite against Palestinians but to kill them in cold blood. Only a few days ago, an injured Palestinian who was incapacitated and lying on the ground was murdered by an Israeli soldier (you can watch the video below). Many Israelis consider the soldier a hero and are calling for his release.Israel s life and death stranglehold over millions of Palestinians makes statements like Katz s even more dangerous because many Israeli Jews do not see Palestinians as humans. After all, Israelis were lounging in chairs on hilltops and cheering as thousands of civilians were being killed in Gaza in the summer of 2014. Israeli politicians have a long history of frightening language against Palestinians. Whether it is Israeli Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked s reference to Palestinian children as snakes, or Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu s continuous incitement, Katz s statement is just the latest round of Israeli politicians tripping over each other to dehumanize Palestinians.Watch video here: [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Bl9zAM5A4] Featured image via video screenshot.",News,"March 30, 2016"

13987,CONSERVATIVE MOM And Cruz Supporter Goes All In For TRUMP…And Here’s Why,"A message from a 100% FED UP mom to her Facebook friends:Dear friends,I donated to two presidential campaigns this year, Dr. Ben Carson and Ted Cruz. I voted for Rand Paul in the straw poll at the Republican convention on Mackinac Island, MI in September. I am proud to say that today, I am 100% behind Donald Trump. I am actually looking forward to watching him CRUSH Hillary in the general election.After watching Barack Hussein Obama serve as our cowardly, racist, incompetent, Divider In Chief for eight long years, I m ready for a President with courage and the ability to make this country truly great again. I want someone who tells the free loaders, drug dealers and gang members from Mexico and Central America they re not welcome here anymore. I want a border that cannot be penetrated, and if it is, I want our Border Patrol agents to be able to do the jobs they were trained to do. I want a President who isn t afraid to say we need to address the issue of unchecked immigration into our country from Muslim majority nations who want to destroy our way of life. I want a President who won t run to the golf course after an innocent American is beheaded or lie to Americans about a video after four brave Americans are killed all because his Secretary of State wouldn t give them what they needed to survive in Benghazi. I want a President who will heal the racial divide our current President instigated with his former DOJ and his inner circle of race baiters for hire. I want a President who will unleash our natural resources so we won t have to be dependent on ISIS, Saudi Arabia and Iran for oil. I want a President who won t visit communist countries and spend the afternoon watching baseball with brutal dictators, behaving as though he was spending the day with the Pope. I want a President who respects the hard work of EVERY man and woman in America, and understands that in order to achieve the American dream, we need to work hard and make a few sacrifices. I want a President who refuses to allow the media to control the narrative. I want a President who has raised a family he can be proud of and for that matter, that America can be proud of. For all those reasons and many, many more, I am excited that Donald J. Trump will be the Republican candidate for President.As a side note, I m also looking to clean up my friends list. If any of my Facebook  friends  feel it is more important to thump their chests and demand that they will never vote for Trump (or in other words, that they will support Hillary) kindly hit the un-friend button at the top of my page. I m on the side of America, and I m choosing to support a man who loves his country so much that he s wiling to walk away from everything he s worked so hard to build in order to save us. Trump didn t ask to walk through barricades to get away from hateful liberals in CA who would like harm him. He didn t ask for Soros funded freaks to follow him wherever he goes, threatening violence against him and his supporters. He could be sitting in Trump Towers working on multimillion dollar deals, but God chose a different path for him and he accepted the challenge. I am grateful to him for the sacrifices he and his family will make, and I will pray that God keeps him safe, healthy and strong. Most of all, I will pray that he brings jobs back to the millions of unemployed Americans who have given up hope on ever finding a job. I will pray that he follows through on his promise to help our veterans to get the best health care America has to offer. And finally, I will pray that he rebuilds our military and gives our soldiers the ability to fight to win, and to keep the greatest nation in the world safe and prosperous for generations to come.There is no time to waste with petty bickering. While I understand there will be a lot of hard feelings amongst Ted, Carly and Marco supporters, it s time to come together now for the good of our country.Bill Clinton is walking around in a state of mostly confusion, while Hillary is traveling with a full-time physician. In addition to being the MOST crooked candidate to ever run for President, she is not well. She will likely chose the old Socialist Bernie Sanders as her running mate to shore up the young voters she cannot persuade to support her campaign. Sadly, Hillary knows she can t win without the  I just want free-shit  vote. Together, they will destroy more businesses, as they increase EPA regulations to fight a phony climate change war. They ll decrease spending for our military in order to reallocate funds to more social programs and programs designed to tighten the screws on our law enforcement, making it nearly impossible for them to do their jobs. The conditions at our VA hospitals will worsen, as our tax dollars will be used to pay for free college for young people who have no clue what it means to selflessly serve their country. There will be a push for gun control like we ve never seen before in America, and we will witness some of the most radical Supreme Court picks who will wholly support their progressive agenda. Meanwhile, people who have the ability to stop another four years of Obama will be proudly tweeting #NeverTrump, as though we should admire them for their courage to stand up for their  principles! I have three young daughters. I won t give up this fight until I know we have a President who takes the threat of Sharia Law in America seriously. For anyone who thinks that can t happen, London is on the verge of electing a radical Muslim as their next Mayor, as I write this rant.When November rolls around, I ll be supporting a candidate who isn t worried about hurting the feelings of a radical Muslim with a suicide vest in his suitcase, as he travels (at the expense of the American taxpayer) to his new taxpayer funded home in my neighborhood. It s time to wise up and start coming together like the Democrats do after each and every primary. It s time to try something new it s called  winning.  #NeverHillary!

12980,TRUMP SLAMS OBAMA AND VOWS To Undo Cuban Policy,"Last year Obama added an action to his manifesto that would forever put him in the cross-hairs of Americans nationwide when he announced that he would be normalizing diplomatic relations with Communist-Cuba. Cuban-Americans were deeply offended and angered that Obama would extend the hand of friendship to the very regime that ha tortured and murdered their family members for years simply for having an opinion.Here are just a few facts from Obamas Policy on Cuba:*General tourist travel is still prohibited, but Americans authorized to visit Cuba for any of a dozen specific reasons can do so without first obtaining a special license from the government. The 12 categories of acceptable travel include family visits, official visits, journalistic, professional, educational and religious activities, and public performances.*Licensed U.S. travelers to Cuba can use credit cards and spend money in the country, and are able to import $400 worth of goods from Cuba, including up to $100 in tobacco and alcohol products. *Americans can send more money to Cubans, up to $2,000 every three months instead of the $500 currently permitted. *U.S. citizens can bring home small amounts of Cuban cigars. *U.S. companies will be able to export cell phones, televisions, memory and recording devices, computers and software to Cuba. Cuba is known to have poor Internet and telecommunications infrastructure.Thankfully in Miami on Friday, Trump announced at his rally that when elected he would be undoing that order unless Cuba met OUR demands first.Trump promised to  stand with the Cuban people in their fight against communist oppression  and condemned Obama s  concessions  to the Castro regime. All of the concessions that Barack Obama has granted the Castro regime were done through executive order, which means the next president can reverse them, and that, I will do, unless the Castro regime meets our demands   not my demands, our demands.  Obama can t really seem to shock us anymore however, he has made deals and woven ties with numerous terroristic countries over his 8 years in office, and yet we still see no actually improvement in our own country.

13814,HERE ARE THE FIVE State Department Rules That Hillary Violated [Video],"While Hillary doubles down on her false claim that the rules were clarified AFTER she left the State Department, we ve got the 5 top rules she broke. But first we need to listen to the masterful liar herself:Hillary Clinton doubles down on defending her email practices:  Rules were not clarified until after I had left. https://t.co/ggH7XtU5Qo  ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) May 26, 2016 That investigation is ongoing, but the report identifies five other laws or regulations that Clinton circumvented or failed to follow. They contradict the Clinton campaign s repeated claims that Clinton s email practices at the State Department complied with all relevant rules regarding federal records and information security.Retaining agency records after leaving  Departing officials and employees [may] not remove Federal records from agency custody   36 C.F.R.   1222.24Clinton s personal email address, which she used exclusively as secretary of state, was housed on a private email server in her Chappaqua, N.Y. home. That meant her emails, which are considered federal records, were never in federal custody while she served as secretary. She didn t just retain records after leaving the State Department; those records were never in the department s possession in the first place.Properly archiving agency records  Agencies that allow employees to send and receive official electronic mail messages using a system not operated by the agency must ensure that Federal records sent or received on such systems are preserved in the appropriate agency recordkeeping system.   36 C.F.R.   1236.22(b)Clinton claims that the fact she was sending emails to federal employees using official email accounts meant that those emails were being archived properly. The IG rejected that explanation and concluded that Clinton had violated rules on the preservation of federal records. Secretary Clinton should have preserved any Federal records she created and received on her personal account by printing and filing those records with the related files in the Office of the Secretary,  the IG wrote.Preserving federal records from loss or destruction  All Department employees are   required by law to preserve documentary materials meeting the definition of a record under the Federal Records Act [and are] responsible for creating, using, maintaining, preserving, and disposing of the Department s information and records.   State Department Foreign Affairs ManualClinton has said that she deleted roughly 30,000 emails stored on her server that she deemed of a personal and non-official nature. Neither the State Department nor the records agency has ever seen those emails. We now know that they included messages that were official in nature.The IG report identified a number of such emails to Gen. David Petraeus.  The Department of Defense provided to OIG in September 2015 copies of 19 emails between Secretary Clinton and General David Petraeus on his official Department of Defense email account.  None of those 19 emails were turned over to the State Department.Other deleted Clinton emails included dispatches about the Libyan civil war and the Sept. 11, 2012, terrorist attacks on U.S. diplomatic facilities in the country.Use of department-approved computing devices  It is the Department s general policy that normal day-to-day operations be conducted on an authorized AIS, which has the proper level of security control to provide nonrepudiation, authentication and encryption, to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the resident information.   State Department Foreign Affairs ManualAccording to the inspector general, Clinton never received department approval to conduct official agency business on her private email server. She never consulted with the proper authorities before doing so. If she had, her email arrangement would have been rejected. According to the current CIO and Assistant Secretary for Diplomatic Security, Secretary Clinton had an obligation to discuss using her personal email account to conduct official business with their offices, who in turn would have attempted to provide her with approved and secured means that met her business needs,  stated the IG report. However, according to these officials, DS and IRM did not and would not approve her exclusive reliance on a personal email account to conduct Department business, because of the restrictions in the FAM and the security risks in doing so. Handling of sensitive-but-unclassified (SBU) information  Where warranted by the nature of the information, employees who will be transmitting SBU information outside of the Department network on a regular basis to the same official and/or most personal addresses, must contact the [information security officials] for guidance in implementing a secure technical solution for those transmissions.   State Department Foreign Affairs Manual Emails exchanged on [Clinton s] personal account regularly contained information marked as SBU,  but she never obtained the required approval for the handling of such information on a personal computing device. Because a security review never occurred,  Secretary Clinton never demonstrated   that her private server or mobile device met minimum information security requirements. Information security officials from Clinton s time at the agency told the IG  that they were not asked to approve or otherwise review the use of Secretary Clinton s server and that they had no knowledge of approval or review by other Department staff. These officials also stated that they were unaware of the scope or extent of Secretary Clinton s use of a personal email account, though many of them sent emails to the Secretary on this account.

7908, Trump’s Longtime Adviser Officially Banned From Appearing On CNN For Being Too Racist,"CNN announced it would be indefinitely banning one of Trump s biggest cheerleaders from ever appearing on their network for being too racist, too sexist, too violent, and too vulgar. Hey, it s the company you keep, right Trump?As a longtime friend and adviser to Trump and his presidential campaign, Roger Stone was a frequent guest on cable news. Unfortunately, he was also one of the world s biggest assholes. Taking his cue from Trump himself, Stone would often go on unhinged racist and sexist rants targeting  enemies of Trump  he saw in the media. Recently, Stone withdrew from Trump s campaign, but managed to still book himself on CNN at least seven times in the last month to viciously attack Trump s opponents.It s hard to imagine a more repugnant person being allowed to spread his toxic waste on television every other day. He makes no secret of his vileness. On Twitter, he s prone to ugly, violent outbursts at the drop of a hat. Much of his rage is focused on CNN employees. He s called commentator Ana Navarro an  Entitled Diva Bitch  and has repeatedly called former CNN commentator Roland Martin a  negro. @ForTrump2016 @ananavarro no , she's a MORON.

In a statement, they announced they would be banning Stone, saying  He will no longer appear on CNN. Stone managed to miss the chance to reflect on his own ugly behavior entirely. He blamed CNN s ban on  Hillary Clinton.Funny   seems the Clintons have ordered CNN not to interview me in the future because I am not PC #censorship https://t.co/ppr7o2hfCp  Roger Stone (@RogerJStoneJr) February 23, 2016Trump, of course, is doing little to hide his own racist, sexist sensibilities. Not quite as vulgar as his friend Stone, Trump has managed to attack and smear almost any minority group he thinks he can get away with. His rhetoric has consistently bordered on the violent. Sometimes it spilled over. At a recent campaign event, he told the enthusiastic crowd that he wished he could punch a protester in the face. They crowd went nuts. He also promised as president he would bring back torture and send a private army to round up undocumented families and forcefully deport them.Stone might be too dumb to censor his ugly beliefs, but he and Trump seem to be very much on the same page when it comes to policy.Featured image via Gawker",News,"February 23, 2016"
4612, Columnist Wins The Internet With Priceless Answer To Hillary-Hater’s Silly Question (TWEET),"Rex Huppke, of the Chicago Tribune, is not exactly known for his formality or reverence toward pretty much anything. He also voices a lot of support for Hillary Clinton in his columns. There are probably a lot of readers who take him to task for that, but one apparently stood out to him, and he just had to highlight it on Twitter.This person asked,  Rex, are you being paid by the Clinton Crime Family Foundation?

My response: pic.twitter.com/32XXb2TgRe  Rex Huppke (@RexHuppke) September 15, 2016Well, that s pretty much all of the right s major conspiracy theories and fear-filled talking points right there. He did forget the one where Hillary and Obama are coming to take everyone s guns, but that can be overlooked. The  Hail Hydra!  finishes this answer off with a nice, neat little bow.There s nothing the Hillary-haters love more than a good conspiracy theory. Can t find solid evidence that she s a criminal? It s because she and her husband have paid everyone off. She s coughing and has pneumonia? She s covering up a brain tumor, brain damage and Parkinson s, if she s not outright dead and has a body double doing her appearances for her. People disappear out of the public eye? Obviously, Hillary had them murdered.She s close to her assistant, Huma Abedin, so they must be secret lesbian lovers. And of course, the conspiracy-mongers are still Benghazhingly Benghaziing their Benghazist Benghazis, which spawned the entire email scandal, which is another conspiracy theory of its own.A lot of this is being fueled by Donald Trump himself, because he actually encourages this type of thinking among his loyal subjects. He loves conspiracy theories too   he s the one who put the birther movement into the spotlight. He also claimed that Ted Cruz s father may have helped assassinate John F. Kennedy. One of his favorite phrases seems to be,  Something s going on,  and he declares loudly that we must find out what it is, which adds fuel to the fire.While it s not clear whether Huppke responded to a Trumpkin or a left-wing Hillary-hater, the truth is that the line between the two is increasingly blurred.

951," Hannity Defends Trump With Psychotic Threat To Morning Joe, This Could Ruin Him (TWEET)","One of Donald Trump s biggest fans, Fox News host Sean Hannity, has just tried to come to his rescue after the POTUS was condemned for his disgusting attack on Morning Joe hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski.On Saturday, as Trump himself was having a meltdown on Twitter, Hannity decided to join the chaos by defending Trump and his petty, nasty attacks on the Morning Joe hosts. In a disgusting attempt to kiss Trump s *ss, Hannity made an insane threat to the MSNBC news couple, hinting that he had some incriminating dirt on the Morning Joe hosts.No one really knows what the hell  going  there'  actually means, but he s likely trying to channel Trump in his ominous threat   and if he s really trying to emulate Trump, we can bet that he s bluffing.Hannity has a history of going after Scarborough, having previously claimed that Scarborough has many skeletons  in his  closet (& office).  When Hannity had made those statements, he was referring to an incident in which a dead intern was found in Scarborough s district office during his time as a Congressman in 2001. While Scarborough had nothing to do with the intern s death, he resigned from his position due to the conspiracy theories surrounding the incident. Coincidentally, Trump also loves conspiracy theories.While we re not aware of what other nonsense Hannity might want to spread about Scarborough and Brzezinski, is certainly a shame that he s threatening the couple just because they re speaking out against Trump.Hannity s cryptic tweet proves that Fox News and its reporters will do anything to defend Trump, no matter how bad it makes them look. Just last month, Hannity said he would be willing to pay for therapy for the Morning Joe hosts because he felt they d become  unhinged.  Clearly, it s the other way around.Featured image is a screenshot",News,"July 1, 2017"
7901, Donald Trump Thanks The ‘Poorly Educated’ For Handing Him Victory In Nevada (VIDEO),"Donald Trump moved ever closer to securing the Republican nomination for President of the United States this week with victory in the Nevada caucus.There s no way around it   Trump thrashed his opponents in Nevada. He won a massive 45.9% of the vote, knocking Marco Rubio into 2nd place with just 23.9%, and Cruz in 3rd on 21.4%. It appears that the Trump campaign is unassailable at this point, although a week is a long time in U.S. politics.Graphic via GuardianPerhaps the darkest moment of the night was when Trump actually said these words in his victory speech: We won with poorly educated! I love the poorly educated! There were whopping cheers and applause for this comment. Which seemingly bore zero irony. He continued: We re the smartest people. We re the most loyal people. First things first: Donald Trump is not poorly educated. He attended the Kew Forest School until 8th grade before spending the rest of his schooling in the New York Military Academy. He later won a bachelors degree in Economic from the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania. So, another total lie from this candidate.One reason  poorly educated  might appeal to Trump though, is that part of the education process is to give a person the tools to think critically about an issue, and to fact-check arguments. It is not to say you cannot have these skills without a decent high school education, but it s an uphill struggle. It s not impossible to save a person having a heart attack without having had medical training, but you d put your money on the doctor every time.So, now wonder Trump would like to keep America under-educated.According to leading fact-checking site Politifact, just 1% of claims made by Donald Trump are true. One percent! Meanwhile, 3 out of every 5 statements he makes are absolute lies. Let s take a look back at some of those lies:They just keep on coming.And on the matter of faith, Donald Trump is now claiming to be some sort of born again evangelical. Yet, Trump has been married three times, pokes fun of Holy Communion as eating  the little cracker , claims he has never asked God to forgive his sins in his life, and could not name a single passage of the Bible when pressed for his favorite piece of scripture.Trump is about as devout a Christian as Bill Nye.And yet, he is winning evangelical support in droves. Why? Because the evangelical, Christian Conservative movement has zero to do with faith in God, and everything to do with a fanatical conviction in right-wing principles of crony capitalism, white supremacy, homophobia and sexism.If this was not the case, Trump would be the LAST candidate that appealed to Evangelicals. To any right-thinking Christian, he is the 21st century incarnation of the Whore of Babylon.But Trump gets a pass for all of this, because under-educated people are having their ignorance exploited, and bigoted people are having their bellies tickled. This resurgent right is euphoric that it s candidate can say things on national television that have been outlawed in workplaces and public spaces for decades. They are thrilled that hate has been made mainstream by their candidate, and they are going to come out in their droves to support him.This means that voting in this year s election will be the most important ballots cast on American soil in a very long time. The reproductive rights of women, the rights of LGBT Americans, the rights of non-Christians, the rights of victims of rape and sexual assault, the rights of victims of gun crime, the rights of non-white Americans   they are all on the chopping block in this election.  Every American with a conscience and a sense of decency has the absolute duty to make a stand against this sh*tstorm of stupidity, bigotry and ignorance.

21707,LIB PROFESSOR AND HARVARD GRAD SAYS PEDOPHILIA IS NOT A CRIME…Read Why…,"Perhaps if one of her children or a close relative was sexually abused by a pedophile, she may not be so generous with her assessment of these criminals Margo Kaplan is not very popular today. In the Monday edition of the New York Times, the Rutgers-Camden law professor, an NYU and Harvard graduate, takes to the op-ed pages to argue that we ve got it all wrong when it comes to pedophilia. She writes that pedophiles don t necessarily turn out to be child molesters and that pedophilia is not a choice, i.e. a pedophile might be born that way. We reached her in her office in Camden to discuss.You really lit up the comments section of the op-ed page today. Yes, but I have to be honest. I am getting more emails of support than I ever expected. I m shocked. I expected to get maybe 95% negative emails, but I ve gotten so many positive ones. The online comments, though, are pretty uniformly negative, and a lot of people haven t even read the article.I know your pain. Who are you getting these positive emails from?A lot of people I don t even know. There s a former prosecutor, a judge, a nurse. Individuals with family members who have pedophilia.How much of the population has pedophilia?We re not entirely sure, but the estimates are around one-percent of the male population, and those in the female population are assumed to be much smaller. As far as the number of people with pedophilia who do sex offend and who do not, there are a lot of assumptions but very little data, because we have very little treatment, very little information.Why is that?There is so much stigma. There is very little reason to come forth and identify as a pedophile. There are no large scale studies, no large treatment programs, no big research studies on this. I contacted the National Institutes of Health, and they don t spend any money on pedophilia.But you are basically saying, hey, let s take it easy on pedophiles. Well, but I am not saying that about sex offenders. I say that they remain responsible for their conduct. We need to treat pedophiles before they offend. People see the word  pedophile  and think  sex offender.  People choose to sex offend children. They do not choose to be pedophiles.Since you say there are so many misconceptions, why don t you tell us what a pedophile really is.A person with an intense and recurrent sexual attraction to prepubescent children, children who have not yet entered any form of puberty. And according to the DSM [Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders], it constitutes a mental disorder when you act on it, but not just that. It also constitutes a mental disorder if it causes  marked distress or interpersonal difficulty,  and, as you can imagine, pedophilia will cause this.In your article, you open by saying that as a pedophile s numerical age increases into teenage years and then adulthood, the numerical age of those he is attracted to does not. Are most pedophiles really starting that young?For many individuals, it is really an onset in adolescence, similar to how many sexual attractions happen. Individuals who are heterosexual, you realize you are attracted to the opposite sex when you are a kid. For a pedophile, you get older, but you keep being attracted to little kids, and many people start to realize this during adolescence. So imagine trying to deal with that during adolescence in addition to the other confusing feelings that you re having.If America is totally off course on this issue, is there any country that is getting it right? We re not that unique. But Germany is ahead of the curve. They have a large scale treatment program called Prevention Project Dunkenfeld, which is probably the first large scale treatment project that also includes non-offenders. They have billboards everywhere:  Do you have attraction to children in ways that you shouldn t? You are not responsible for your attraction, but you are responsible for your behavior. OK, so as a guy with two young kids, how do I protect them? There s no easy answer to that, but you want to protect them from sex offenders. Most people who offend are not actually pedophiles. It s interesting: When you talk about pedophiles, people think about the children. And they re right. But what about the children who are struggling with this disorder? We need to help them, too.But you can understand if maybe I ll just try to keep them away from pedophiles anyway. I can understand that. We need to prevent pedophiles from sexually offending and to do that, we need to refocus on early intervention, treatment and prevention. It s not always going to work. No treatment of any mental disorder will always work. Depression treatment, schizophrenia treatment   they don t always work. But we don t throw our hands into the air and wait until the consequences of those conditions become bad before we do something. With pedophiles, we ve already thrown our hands into the air. We should not be taking this tactic. The dire consequences only make it more important that we reach out and treat early.Via: Phillymag.com ",left-news,"May 22, 2015"
4448, New Poll EMBARRASSES The Hell Out Of Trump – He Lost To More Than Hillary,"While Trump crows about all the unscientific, self-selecting online polls that were rigged by his followers, the scientific polls with credibility are telling a very different post-debate story. One particular poll, which NBC conducted starting from the end of the debate on Sept. 26 into Sept. 27, shows Trump did so poorly that more people said neither candidate won than said Trump won.According to that poll, 52 percent of likely voters said Hillary won. 21 percent said Trump won, and 26 percent said neither candidate won.Image via NBC NewsOuch. Ouch ouch ouch. For someone who was only able to speak for 38 percent of the time, compared to Trump s 62 percent (and constant  Just shut up because I am God  interruptions), poll numbers like that are pretty astonishing.It s about as bad as when candidates finish worse than  none of these candidates  at the ballot box. Basically, there is nobody except the Trumpkins who believes Trump did anything of value Monday night. Furthermore, just 26 percent of Republican respondents said that the debate changed their opinion of Trump for the better. That s a pretty sorry number compared to 50 percent of Democratic respondents saying their opinion of Hillary changed for the better.Some Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill were disappointed in Trump and his performance, too. They wanted him to attack Hillary over the dead horse of an email scandal they re so sure makes her unfit to lead the country, and he didn t. Others, however, were frustrated with his inability to put forth succinct talking points: I wish that he d say something, stick with it, and then move on to something else instead of saying the same thing over and over and over,  [Arizona Rep. Matt] Salmon said in an interview Tuesday without giving specific examples.  It was just throughout the entire debate.' Anyone who tries to read a complete transcript of the debate will have the same frustration, if not worse. Trump literally cannot stick to the point, rambles on, talks in circles, etc., and Hillary wiped the floor with him in part because of that. The rest of it   well, she s eminently qualified and he isn t, and she proved it.The NBC poll was conducted online among a sample of 7,541 likely voters, culled from the 3 million adults who take surveys on SurveyMonkey every day.

3960, Nikki Reed DESTROYS Trump For Insulting Women In Epic Video,"The Twilight actress absolutely shredded the Republican nominee.And the reason why is pretty clear. Throughout his campaign, Donald Trump has repeatedly insulted women to the point where if only women voted in this election Hillary Clinton would win in a landslide that would give her a mandate.Indeed, Clinton is on pace to do even better with women on November 8th than President Obama did in 2008 and 2012.But just in case there are women out there who have not heard any of the things Trump has said about them, Nikki Reed blasted Trump s misogyny in a new video posted by Humanity For Hillary.In the video, Reed slammed Donald Trump and all the men who support him in an NSFW feminist smackdown that Trump is going to throw a hissy fit about on Twitter for days. This has been a bruising election,  Reed begins.  On the one hand, we have the chance to elect a lifelong public servant, powerful, experienced, highly qualified to be the first female President of the United States. On the other hand, a candidate who reminds us of the worst men in our lives. Men who saw a powerful woman and tried to block her rise. Our rise. Men who called us bossy, unlikable, liars, and attention seekers. Ambitious, like that s a bad thing. Reed went on to talk about how misogynists like Trump attacked women for doing things like writing books and making movies and that when women continued to achieve new heights despite them they started hurling insults like the C-word, a word that Donald Trump has used in the past. I ve been called the C-word,  Reed said.  Have you been called the C-word? Reed then pointed out that there is an anti-Hillary SuperPac called C.U.N.T. and proceeded reference Trump calling Hillary a  nasty woman  by calling upon all nasty women to vote against Trump on Election Day because  we are so very close to putting all of that behind us because nasty women vote. And then she sent a message to Trump and his deplorable sexist supporters. So Donald Trump and to every man like Donald Trump who grabbed us, blocked us, who called us fat, unqualified, stupid, ugly and c*nt, we have one thing to say to you: C. U. Next Tuesday. Here s the video via Facebook.Make no mistake, if this campaign and Donald Trump s life before it are any indication, women will be treated like absolute shit if Trump somehow becomes president. There is no doubt about that whatsoever. That s why is it crucial that women vote on Election Day no matter what. Because if Trump wins, women will lose everything they have fought for over the last 100 years, including the right to vote.Featured image via video screen capture",News,"November 3, 2016"

23086,MEDIA TRIPWIRE? Ping Pong Pizza Conspiracy Propels Internet Censorship Amid ‘Fake News’ Witch-Hunt," Funny how secrets travel. I d start to believe, if I were to bleed.    Lyrics written by David Bowie from the album OutsideShawn Helton 21st Century Wire In the days before the US presidential election in November 2016, Wikileaks revealed a new string of emails connected to Hillary Clinton s 2016 campaign chairman, John Podesta. Online interpretations of the leaked Podesta email exchanges subsequently led to a digital firestorm on social media, producing an intense conspiratorial  open source investigation  still in search of its smoking gun. However, the phenomenon now known by its hashtag #Pizzagate has since set a number of tertiary events into motion. Is there a real story hidden amongst the debris of this online explosion?Is it possible that  open source investigators  were being led into a virtual cul-de-sac and thus missing the real story?More importantly, could people be playing into the hands of the very establishment they seek to depose?Let s investigate   SHOCK & AWE    Over the past month, the DC-based restaurant Comet Ping Pong, along with Besta Pizza (to a lesser degree Austin s East Side Pies) has been the subject of a peculiar internet-based conspiracy. (Photo Illustration Shawn Helton of 21WIRE)CONTEXT: Podesta Emails, False Hacks & ConspiracyWhile many of the leaked Podesta emails (including the really important one admitting that US partners Qatar and Saudi Arabia are giving funding and  logistical support  of ISIS) caused a major stir in the run-up to the 2016 Election, few Wikileaks releases have attracted more attention then the Podesta emails associated with the internet-based conspiracy dubbed  Pizzagate. In fact, since the release of the so-called  pizzagate  emails, a bundle of leaks and media reports associated with the Clintons political pay-for-play allegations, as well as the shocking admission regarding voter fraud from disgraced Democratic National committee consultant Robert Creamer prior to the 2016 presidential election, have all but disappeared from the mainstream narrative. Very convenient, if you are part of the Democratic Party establishment.Remember that all of this was taking place right after the mainstream media along with the White House, set the stage for a massive PR push implicating Russia as a disrupting force for evil in the US presidential election   allegedly through Kremlin-sponsored hacking of US democratic institutions and through  sophisticated Russian propaganda. In August, the western media s claims against Russia hit overdrive, when the  New York Times s Moscow bureau was the target of an attempted cyber attack this month. But so far, there is no evidence that the hackers, believed to be Russian, were successful. Flash forward to September here and here, as well as early October in the lead up to President Obama s Russian Hack decree, the Clinton-friendly outlet, the NY Times, had all but solidified the Russian cyber-hack claims   but once again, without any definitive evidence or proof.Throw in another American  October surprise  in the form distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, renewed calls for the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) internet, led to so-called cyber experts blaming the largest  hack on America  because of the inability to pass SOPA   in effect, reigniting the previously stalled SOPA in Washington DC, along with all of its draconian copyright law positions   all perfectly timed as mainstream reports regarding  fake news suddenly became all the rage across all forms of media.The media clips on YouTube below illustrate the kind of duplicitous double speak regarding the  election rigging  that has become a hallmark of the Obama administration and establishment Washington Following 2016 s US presidential election cycle, a Russian election-hack-theory gained even more media traction, orbiting the political realm like a low-hanging fruit (propelled by President Obama and now the CIA, both conflicting with the FBI s assessment in October), dovetailing with the first grumblings that  fake news  had somehow decided the US presidential election in favor of one candidate, Donald Trump. These are serious accusations that have still failed to yield any solid forensic results from the intelligence community.Is this mere political gamesmanship, or is there more at work?Could this all be covering up and diverting the public away from some other explosive events?  LOLITA EXPRESS    In 2008, Jeffery Epstein was convicted of soliciting an underage girl for prostitution (Image Source: miamibeachadvocate.com)As internet researches battle with mainstream media over allegations in #Pizzagate, another potentially much bigger story became buried under the digital avalanche. If this is indeed the case, then who benefits?The  Lolita Express  ScandalSeemingly even more unsettling and disturbing in 2016, was the vastly underreported  Lolita Express  scandal swirling around the Clinton Campaign.In 2010, Jeffery Epstein, a billionaire hedge fund mogul who is also a member of the Trilateral Commission and the Council on Foreign Relations (as well as playing a role in the formation of the Clinton Global Initiative), effectively walked free even though a 53-page indictment could have landed him in prison for 20 years according to reports. Epstein s  Gatsbyesque  persona once described by New York magazine, has long since given way to a new profile as a convicted sex-offender  a superstar who was now condemned by a litany of legal troubles due to reports of ghastly serial abuse during the past decade.However, during this year s election cycle, coverage concerning new details associated with Epstein s private island, Little St. James, and allegations of sex slave entertainment enterprise there, was virtually buried by the US corporate media.The drop in wall-to-wall coverage from the tongue-tied mainstream media was most likely due to Epstein s close affiliation to former President Bill Clinton, who according flight manifests and other supporting evidence, took  at least 26 trips aboard the  Lolita Express    even apparently ditching his Secret Service detail for at least five of the flights, according to records obtained by FoxNews.com. It doesn t stop there either. Other high-profile names linked to the Epstein case included former Democratic governor Bill Richardson, Kurt Cobain widow Courtney Love, prominent celebrity lawyer, Israeli advocate and Harvard Law professor Alan Dershowitz, British royal Prince Andrew, former Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak, and even president-elect Donald Trump.  THE BLACK BOOK     Epstein flight records and  a little black book  paint a very intriguing picture. (Image Source: Gawker)Interestingly, the Epstein case was covered heavily by Gawker   a news outlets which is now facing bankruptcy following a defamation case won by Hulk Hogan (Terrence Gene Bollea) over the controversial publication of the wrestling icon s sex tape. Hogan s legal victory  took Gawker out  but could the real reason have been its Epstein coverage? Here s some of what Gawker said about the Epstein case: Donald Trump, Courtney Love, former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, and uber-lawyer Alan Dershowitz may have been identified by a butler as potential  material witnesses  to pedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein s crimes against young girls, according to a copy of Epstein s little black book obtained by Gawker.An annotated copy of the address book, which also contains entries for Alec Baldwin, Ralph Fiennes, Griffin Dunne, New York Post gossip Richard Johnson, Ted Kennedy, David Koch, filmmaker Andrew Jarecki, and all manner of other people you might expect a billionaire to know, turned up in court proceedings after Epstein s former house manager Alfredo Rodriguez tried to sell it in 2009. About 50 of the entries, including those of many of Epstein s suspected victims and accomplices as well as Trump, Love, Barak, Dershowitz, and others, were circled by Rodriguez. (The existence of the book has been previously reported by the Daily Mail. Gawker is publishing it in full here for the first time; we have redacted addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses, and the last names of individuals who may have been underage victims.)According to an FBI affidavit, Rodriguez described the address book and the information contained within it as the  Holy Grail  or  Golden Nugget  to unraveling Epstein s sprawling child-sex network. Epstein reportedly also had additional ties to Trump, with both men having on and off again been implicated in a separate Jane Doe  sexual assault lawsuit that was recently dropped in the US court system, apparently for a third time since 1994.The Washington Times discusses how other high-level clients allegedly used Epstein s services   including a member of the British royal family. The following passage is from a report filed in January of 2015: And even post-prison, Mr. Epstein kept up some of these high-profile relationships   leading to his most recent emergence in the news, which involves allegations that he provided Prince Andrew with sexual services from a then-17-year-old American girl, Virginia Roberts.Ms. Roberts, now 30, has filed a federal lawsuit in Florida against Mr. Epstein, alleging he forced her to serve as a  sex slave  and paid her $15,000 to perform sexual services for the prince, the New York Post reported. Here s Sean Stone from RT s Watching the Hawks interviewing Conchita Sarnoff, the Executive Director from The Alliance to Rescue Victims of Trafficking to discuss Epstein s heinous past Another strange turn in the Clinton Email scandal came late in the election, only days before voters went to the polls. Suddenly, it was revealed by media outlets that due to the investigation into the sexting scandal involving disgraced former U.S. Representative Anthony Weiner, (husband of chief Clinton aide Huma Abedine) FBI director James Comey would announce that the agency would be reopening the Clinton email probe.Interestingly, according to a recent interview with Breitbart News, Hillary Clinton herself was alleged to have taken 6 trips to Epstein s Little Saint James island, according to private security kingpin and Blackwater founder Erik Prince. Prior to the election and right after the FBI reopened its investigation into the Clintons (before promptly being shut down for a second time), the controversial mercenary made the extraordinary claim.It s important for readers to note how explosive this revelation truly was, and yet, not one word from either the mainstream media, or  alternative media,  outside of Breitbart and few other blogs, on this potentially devastating allegation. Prince asserted that the NYPD found  way more stuff  within the 650,000 recently scrutinized emails. The news reportedly sent shock waves into the upper echelon of the Democratic Party and the Clinton campaign   as the NYPD was said to have been ready to hand out indictments  into additional criminal activity, possibly involving money laundering and underage sex, among other illicit activity.Prince s commentary on the Democratic Party s apparent corruption was released around the same time as a batch of Podesta Emails that sent internet sleuths down a pizzagate rabbit hole. Prince s claim then seem to be grafted onto the pizzagate theory by some YouTube commentators, only without any actual concrete evidence.In early 2016, the embattled Blackwater (renamed Academi, and then Xe) founder Prince, was the subject of an inquiry that alleged he was involved in a major money laundering scheme with the Bank of China in Libya. In 2014, Prince supposedly setup  Frontier Services Group in 2014 with the help of major Chinese investment firm Citic Group. When you factor in how Prince himself became the subject of a major scandal and is now on the offensive, it s hard to know whether his claims are true or just a political ploy aimed at deflecting his own controversy. However, his claims do offer a dark view into a political party that has been in a downward spiral for several years.Wheat from the ChaffWith all of that in mind, for any true investigation to take place, the facts still need to be separated from what might only be innuendo and overt speculation.Other apparent conspiracies were also brought into the fold during the ascendency of #pizzagate, as social media users seemed to make some startling connections, although without a complete story. The lack of coherence of pizzagate allegations opened the door for some of the usual suspects to come in to steer the conversation away from some potentially damaging connections back to the Clintons. Establishment gatekeeper publication The Daily Beast reported the following in the passage below: Written by user  PleadingtheYiff,  the post attempts to link the Clinton campaign to Laura Silsby, an Idaho missionary who served a six-month prison sentence in Haiti after the organization she founded, New Life Children s Refuge, attempted to transport 33 Haitian children to the Dominican Republic after the 2010 Haiti earthquake.The user s primary proof of links between the Clintons and Silsby:  Huma Abedin was constantly forwarding Hillary articles on this woman s organization.  The post provides no email sent from Clinton to Abedin regarding the incident.The theory then includes a major error. One of the first things Hillary did when she took over the scene in Haiti was to get Laura off the hook,  PleadingtheYiff writes, then links to a website called  AboveTopSecret.com. Silsby wasn t freed and instead remained incarcerated in Haiti, where she faced trial and was found guilty. The nine other missionaries jailed alongside her were freed. Is it possible that the Laura Silsby case was buried under endless collateral damage from pizzagate?With even more damning American conspiracies in 2016, such as the DNC fraud, violent protests funded by George Soros, or the Pentagon paying PR firm Bell Pottinger $540 million to produce fake terror videos, in addition to the Lolita Express revelations concerning the Clintons in particular, you have to wonder whether the pizzagate theory was an unintended coincidence or if it was yet another socially engineered agenda that masked other media stories.What s most obvious, however, is how the pizzagate story and spin-off controversies appear to have obfuscated other real criminality contained within the Podesta email leaks, while providing a media smoke screen for the conspiracies mentioned directly above.In the article below we ll take another look at the pizzagate phenomena (along with Comet Ping Pong s gunman story, in addition to one of Washington DC s most notorious scandals) and how the events surrounding the online conspiracy, could be used to shape new censorship protocols in the wake of US media s witch-hunt for  fake news  sites   LEAKED    John Podesta former chairman for Hillary Clinton s 2016 presidential campaign, pictured with Clinton chief aid Huma Abedin on the Clinton campaign jet. Spirit Cooking & #Pizzagate: A Media-Driven Psy-Op?Within the contents of the controversial Podesta dispatch by Wikileaks in early November, there appeared to be a distressing email chain between Tony Podesta, a top Democratic lobbyist of the Podesta Group (brother of John Podesta, Hillary Clinton s campaign chairman) and a New York City-based Serbian performance artist named Marina Abramovic.The 2015 email exchange between Tony Podesta and Marina Abramovic (image, left) drew a sharp outcry from users on social media platforms like Twitter and Reddit, after the email conversation revealed a dinner party involving a performance art-based ritual calling for the use of real human blood and bodily fluids, referred to as  spirit cooking.   While Abramovic s occult-influenced art could be seen as sick and deeply disturbing to many, and even degenerate depravity to some   it s important to emphasize there was nothing criminal about her email with Tony Podesta or her dark creations captured on video from as early as two decades ago.The origins of Abramovic s spirit cooking appeared to some researchers to be linked directly to Aleister Crowley s, Thelma religion. This prompted some alternative media outlets to link to Everpedia as their primary source to explain the  truth  behind spirit cooking. The internet-based conspiracy ultimately led to increased speculation, turbo-charging even more spurious connections.Another major magnet for pizzagate researchers was Abramovic s book published in 1997, the self-proclaimed  grandmother  of performance art released a book entitled  Spirit Cooking with essential aphrodisiac recipes,   a rare book that contained a sequence of etchings and perverted recipes.As theories about spirit cooking exploded on social media, a series of Podesta emails were leaked containing what had been thought to be coded language concealing an elite underground child sex ring, according some quasi-investigative online sites and mega forums, citing 4chan and Reddit posts.In addition, it appears that a series of emails released by Wikileaks, here and here, are partially what led to one man, James Alefantis, owner of Comet Ping Pong, to become the central pizzagate antagonist. The fact that Alefantis is listed as one of DC s top 50 most influential people   only fuelled speculation that the internet case was  a slam dunk. Social media inquisitors shared pictures from the Instagram account of Alefantis (now blocked to the public) and other friends and contacts linked with him, in an attempt to conclude a vast conspiracy. While many of these images appeared disturbing in the context of the two conspiracies mentioned above, the images themselves did not prove any actual crime had taken place.As the conspiracy deepened, symbols from the Washington DC restaurant/venue Comet Ping Pong (derived from its menu and logo, as well as other pizza restaurants), in addition to apparent coded Podesta emails, sparked an outcry on social media as the symbols used appeared to mimic those according to a Wikileaks release supposedly from the FBI. The apparent leaked release from the FBI disclosed certain markers in sex trafficking and abuse cases. While there might be similarities in the graphics observed at Comet Ping Pong and nearby Besta Pizza, the evidence is still purely circumstantial and certainly nothing conclusively linking the DC-based pizzerias to any abuse ring. Internet trawlers also claimed to have unearthed photos of the digging of a secret basement-dungeon underneath Comet Ping Pong   a claim which later turned out to be false.Note that this one planted detail in the pizzagate story   the evocative image a  secret basement  reserved for child torture and abuse   sent this story into orbit. This is one example of how one or two simple details injected into a storyline can inflame the narrative and motivate forum users beyond what any real forensic investigation could, by creating a virtual crusade.In fact, it was revealed that  Comet uses a low-slung refrigerator at Buck s Fishing & Camping, Mr. Alefantis s other restaurant two doors down on the same block, to store produce, cheese and proofing dough.   (See left photo by Cecilia Kang)It s worth noting that 4chan was also behind one of the most speculative claims surrounding MH370, a story that allegedly involved the patent holders of the tech company Freescale Semiconductor which turned out to be false. Conversely, 4chan has provided some valuable crowd-sourced information, like in the wake of the 2013 Boston Bombing when 4chan users posted a number of photos indicating the presence of other operatives involved in the event   a point totally blacked-out by US authorities and media.Interestingly, the 4chan website is said to be  struggling to survive  financially in part because of increased users driven by viral and clickbait-like material like pizzagate.Through hyper-speculative and often misleading information spread by social media users, the pizzagate narrative took shape Media TripwireAs the US media brushed off the perceived content of the Podesta emails mentioned above, a ground swell of speculation, hyperbole and unsubstantiated claims filled the vacuum online, as enthusiasm continued unabated.It s also important to recognize that one of the main propellers of the initial Pizzagate story was a popular disinformation website called Your News Wire, who regularly feed the public with completely fake news stories online which get propagated through social media. This website has successfully managed to fool many online readers because it will regularly mix real news articles in with its many invented stories. A viral fake story like this would have netted  Your News Wire  tens of thousands of dollars in ad click revenue.BuzzFeed reports: On Oct. 30, a white supremacy Twitter account that presents itself as belonging to a Jewish lawyer in New York tweeted that the NYPD was looking into evidence that emails from Anthony Weiner s laptop contained evidence of Clinton involvement in an  international child enslavement ring. The next day, Oct. 31, Sean Adl-Tabatabai, who used to work with British conspiracy theorist David Icke, took note of the message board post and the tweet. He wrote a post for his site, YourNewsWire.com. His story took another step by claiming an  FBI insider  had confirmed the claims. Where did this this new FBI source come from? Adl-Tabatabai cited a thread on a 4chan message board from back in July. That thread started when an anonymous user invited questions after describing themself as  a person with intimate knowledge of the inner workings of the Clinton case.  (Adl-Tabatabai did not respond to questions sent to him by BuzzFeed News.) By this point, the story became a viral ball of fire, and there was no stopping it.You have to wonder if the spirit cooking/pizzagate emails, might have been used as a tripwire by the establishment to initiate increased internet censorship, a story that has gathered a big boost from highly speculative ideas pasted together by various social media personalities on YouTube and then codified by large popular  alt-media  outlets like Infowars.com here and here, who levied unconfirmed allegations at Comet Ping Pong restaurant and other private businesses in an affluent area of Washington DC.Few conspiracies in recent years have generated as much public outrage, scrutiny and intense speculation. However, we should question the timing of this conspiracy as it relates to the cyber censorship on the table following the  fake news  crisis.The BBC stated the following after a Podesta email thread leaked in November, mentioned the Alefantis connection: In early November, as Wikileaks steadily released piles of emails from Clinton s campaign chairman John Podesta, one contact caught the attention of prankster sites and people on the paranoid fringes.James Alefantis is the owner of Comet Ping Pong, a pizza restaurant in Washington. He s also a big Democratic Party supporter and raised money for both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. He was once in a relationship with David Brock, an influential liberal operative.Alefantis   who s never met Clinton   appeared in the Podesta emails in connection with the fundraisers. Other claims attached to the pizzagate theory included a link to a tweet from the deceased investigative reporter, Andrew Breitbart. The pizzagate theory seemed to gather steam from this screenshot of an alleged Breitbart tweet below   but is there more to the story?Upon reviewing the origins of the Breitbart tweet now intertwined with the pizzagate theory, there appears to be some contention about what Breitbart might have been referencing. Here s the political blog Hot Air on the matter: It s a classic Andrew Tweet. His abbreviations, his invention of words ( cover-upperer ) tells me that this was probably Andrew s work. I never really knew him to allow anyone to Tweet on his behalf but I suppose it s possible at some point he did so without my knowledge. So, for our discussion let s stipulate that it was Andrew who sent this out. What is he talking about? Anyone who knew Andrew well and worked closely in his sphere and knew what he would talk and Tweet about with regard to  underage sex slave(s)  and John Podesta, knows exactly what he is referring to: ACORN If you don t remember James O Keefe, Hanna Giles and the ACORN story that broke on Andrew s Big Government website in 2009, here s a quick description via Wikipedia, which has a lot of bogus takes on the story, but this brief description is correct: In July and August 2009, Giles and O Keefe visited ACORN offices in Baltimore, Washington, D.C., Brooklyn, San Bernardino, San Diego, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, and Miami. Giles dressed as a prostitute, while O Keefe wore white khakis with a blue dress shirt and/or tie and claimed to be her boyfriend. Giles and O Keefe recorded the encounters using hidden cameras and pretended to be seeking advice on how to run an illegal business that included the use of underage girls in the sex trade. The article goes on to state that the ACORN saga, which had been instrumental in Breitbart s rise in media, had been in some aspect involved an underage abuse story due to the undercover work of James O keefe and Hannah Giles.  STRANGE DAYS    Comet Ping Pong resides in a quiet affluent DC neighborhood. (Image Source: chicago sun-times)The Comet Ping Pong GunmanIn early December, 28 year-old actor Edgar Maddison Welch was arrested by authorities after reportedly discharging a rifle inside Alefantis s Comet Ping Pong restaurant. Welch had been apparently  self-investigating  Comet Ping Pong, the pizzeria at the epicenter of a shocking conspiracy asserting that the establishment is somehow allegedly involved in an expansive child trafficking abuse ring.Welch s background may have raised a few eyebrows of those who have chronicled the profiles of various gunman in recent years (such as his acting/film production past documented on IMDB), he was also recently involved in a major traffic accident in October, badly injuring a young teenager, potentially impacting his state of mind, as well as being exposed in a potential criminal case.While 21WIRE has outlined the possibility of informants being used in shooting events in the past   usually those individuals have had a lengthy criminal past with multiple links to government, military and sometimes the entertainment industry   Welch doesn t entirely fit this typical mold of a convict turned informant or agent provocateur.Perhaps there s another answer The online site Heavy.com released the following information regarding Welch s father and his work preventing child abductions: Harry Welch Jr. is a former police officer, firearms instructor and expert witness on firearms, according to his IMDB profile. He also writes that his family has hosted foster children and has worked to prevent child abuse.He was,  elected President of the North Carolina Crime Stoppers Association (two terms). Served as Executive Director for Protect-A-Child, a national, non-profit organization to prevent abuse and abduction of children. Appointed by Governor Jim Martin to the Governor s Commission on Child Victimization. Was Welch under psychological duress following his recent car accident, feeding into other aspects of his life, such as his father s work to prevent child abuse, then motivated into action by an online conspiracy?Although it s difficult to accurately gauge Welch s true motivation, some YouTube personalities absolutely contend that his involvement was scripted    to smear the a new burgeoning  pizzagate research community  online. Additionally, some researchers cite Welch s relief visit to Haiti in 2010, as absolute  proof of a hoax  because alleged Clinton Foundation ties to human trafficking in Haiti   claims that have to this date, have yet to be completely proven.This part of the pizzagate conspiracy gained steam when Monica Petersen, an activist for sex-worker rights, who over the summer was working for  Claude d Estree, the executive director of the Human Trafficking Center at the University of Denver,  apparently died of a suicide in mid November while in Haiti. However, at the time the circumstances of her death were not entirely clear, which led to intense speculation not grounded in fact. If there was evidence of foul play, certainly this could be investigated as part of a possible cover-up, especially during such a hotly contested US election involving the Clintons   but until that issue is resolved, any talk of  proof  of a wider conspiracy is still just that, talk.The Petersen tragedy was then grafted onto the pizzagate story The Washington Post reported the following, according to executive director d Estree:  Petersen had gone to Haiti a number of times, but she was not there to research human trafficking and was not investigating the Clinton Foundation. He said she had been a  brilliant  research fellow, working the past two years to produce a still unpublished article that critiqued a controversial book on the business of sex trafficking by Siddharth Kara. Unfortunately, Petersen s story got packaged with allegations of a Clinton trafficking conspiracy that was then interwoven within the pizzagate theory and on the same day Welch walked into Comet Ping Pong, the widely-known site Infowars.com  posted a YouTube video titled  Haiti PIZZAGATE: Death of Child Trafficking Investigator,  without actually confirming the full details surrounding Petersen s death. Everpedia, one of the first websites to explain the details of spirit cooking, appeared to also fan the flames of an alleged conspiracy surrounding Petersen s death.An ABC News release below disclosed the full details regarding Welch s apparent criminal activity at Comet Ping Pong: At around 3 p.m., he arrived at the restaurant, where witnesses say they saw Welch holding an assault rifle across his chest, according to the complaint. As he moved toward the back of the restaurant, employees and customers fled the building.As everyone was fleeing, Welch encountered an employee returning from the back freezer, according to court documents. The employee said Welch pointed the AR-15 rifle in his direction, the documents state, but Welch denied raising the firearm at the employee.After the customers and employees left the restaurant, police created a perimeter around it, and at about 3:24 p.m. Welch exited the building with his hands in the air, complying with officers. The story continued, with the following description: At one point he said he encountered a locked door and attempted to open it with a butter knife, the complaint says. When that didn t work, he fired shots at the lock with his AR-15, documents say. Here s a screen shot of Welch s incident report MSM Fake News Witch-HuntFor the mainstream media, pizzagate was the gift that just kept on giving.Following Welch s encounter inside Comet Ping Pong, the conspiracy known as  pizzagate  has fallen into the manipulative hands of the corporate mainstream media, now castigating  speculative alternative media outlets,  which in-turn gave legs to the already convoluted  fake news witch-hunt being waged by mainstream media   specifically aimed at independent outlets and blogs that regularly produce insightful critical analysis.Additionally, since the spirit cooking and pizzagate theories were merging, there has been no solid evidence linking the restaurant to anything criminal, yet the theories continue to persist online, implicating private citizens in what is at this point a  victimless  crime. This has made alternative media an easy target for mainstream media and politicians calling for more  control  over social media content to help stop waht mainstream pundits were now describing as pizzagate s own campaign online abuse and  internet bullying  against Comet Ping Pong s owner and staff.From a legal stand point, the pizzagate conspiracy could also potentially lead to a court case against the root cause of certain defamatory allegations and apparent death threats   as Alefantis and other shop owners are private citizens and not public figures. This is something to consider when presenting any possible theory directly implicating an individual in a major felony. Unless there exists a real forensic smoking gun, or a whistleblower willing to come forward then there is no  case    only speculation which could be construed as libel and defamation without any supporting evidence.While the internet has zeroed-in on pizzeria-based conspiracies over the past two months, it s important to remember that Washington has had a long dark history linked to illicit prostitution and sex trafficking   including at least two such expansive cases that reached all the way to the White House   DISGRACED    Former US Congressman Barney Frank. Frank did not seek re-lection in 2012 after he was found to have engineered a $12 million TARP bailout for OneUnited Bank. (Image Source: businessinsider.com)Washington s Silence: Congressman Frank s  Call Boys In 2011, Democratic Congressman Barney Frank, decided not to seek re-election. While much of the mainstream media waxed poetic about his 30-year career, there was virtually no mention of his involvement in one of the most notable DC scandals over the past three decades.In 1989, it was discovered that Frank s then boyfriend Stephen Gobie (who the US representative once solicited for an $80 dollar sexual encounter) had been running a prostitution ring out of Congressman Frank s Capitol Hill apartment   according to Gobie, Barney Frank was fully aware of the operation.Here s a passage from a Business Insider article from 2011 that describes one of DC s darkest scandals that is barely mentioned by media outlets to this day: Reuters didn t mention it. The New York Times didn t bring it up. The Guardian didn t note it either. The Washington Post got to it in the 17th paragraph.In 1989 it was discovered that Barney Frank s boyfriend, Stephen Gobie, whom Frank had once hired as a male prostitute, was running a male-brothel out of the Congressman s home. Frank claimed he did not know about the prostitution ring in his home, but he did use the power of his office to  fix  33 tickets for Gobie. And he knowingly wrote a misleading letter to Gobie s probation officer in Virginia. Frank received a  reprimand  for fixing the tickets. Gobie maintained that Frank knew about the prostitution ring operation in his home. Even writers who were absolutely untroubled by the openly homosexual lawmaker in 1989 thought that Frank should have resigned. Or they at least acknowledged that there was an abuse of his office. Additionally, the Washington Post reported that Gobie  maintained a relationship with Gabriel A. Massaro, the principal of Chevy Chase Elementary School, and used an office at the school in late 1987 to make telephone calls and have one client meet a prostitute. While Massaro was placed on administrative leave, the conspiracy deepened as the Washington Post followed up the breaking story providing the following details: With Congress in recess, it s too soon to tell if the Massachusetts Democrat will weather his admission that he paid Gobie for sex, hired him as a personal aide and wrote letters on congressional stationary to the convicted felon s probation officer. Shockingly, the scandal continued to persist as the investigation led to other political inquiries. Frank s scandal appeared to overlap and dovetail with another disturbing ring that reached all the way to the White House during the Reagan-Bush era.The Franklin Cover-upThe Barney Frank scandal indeed followed another appalling and chilling scandal dubbed the  Franklin Cover-up.  The shocking case involving Omaha, Nebraska s Franklin Credit Union employee named Lawrence King, who looted his employer to the tune of $38 million dollars. Here s a Washington Post article from 1990 on the matter: Lawrence E. King Jr., everyone now agrees, had a remarkable knack for stretching a dollar. On a salary of $16,200 a year, the credit union manager drove a $70,000 white Mercedes   and still could afford to spend $10,000 a month on limousines. His credit card charges topped $1 million, he owned a four-story house on 26 acres overlooking the Missouri River, and his floral bill alone came to $146,000 during a fragrant, 13-month period in 1987-88. While King s embezzlement was troublesome, it paled into comparison to a wider charge of trafficking and abuse levied at the credit union manager. The Post continued, outlining the awful truth about the abuse tied to King, in a group called the Franklin Five: In June 1988, a social worker at a mental hospital in Omaha reported allegations of possible child abuse to the Nebraska Foster Care Review Board, an agency that monitors the placement of several thousand children in the state.The board subsequently asked Omaha police and the state attorney general to investigate possible  child exploitation,  a  child prostitution ring  and  inappropriate activities by Larry King. More evidence in the same report revealed the following: 21 hours of videotaped testimony from three new witnesses, all in their early twenties, who said that, as minors, they had been victims of physical and sexual abuse. The book entitled The Franklin Cover-up, by former Nebraska state Senator and lawyer, John De Camp, chronicled a case that implicated politicians, judges, those in the military, police, as well as members of the intelligence community in the subsequent abduction of numerous children over the course of many years.Lawrence King was eventually convicted on charges of theft from the Franklin Credit Union and ordered to pay damages to Paul Bonacci for the apparent abuse he suffered during his abduction. Bonacci later told investigators he had participated in the abduction of Johnny Gosch, but according to (Polk County Attorney John Sarcone ) The Des Moines Resgister,  Bonacci has said he took part in Johnny Gosch s abduction, but Sarcone said investigators concluded any involvement by Bonacci was not credible. Here s a short summary of the disturbing case below: On February 5, 1999, in U.S. District Court in Lincoln, Nebraska, an extraordinary hearing occurred in Paul A. Bonacci v. Lawrence E. King, a civil action in which the plaintiff charged that he had been ritualistically abused by the defendant, as part of a nationwide pedophile ring linked to powerful political figures in Washington and to elements of the U.S. military and intelligence establishment. Three weeks later, on February 27, Judge Warren K. Urbom ordered King, who is currently in Federal prison, to pay $1 million in damages to Bonacci, in what Bonacci s attorney John DeCamp said was a clear signal that  the evidence presented was credible. The Frank and Franklin conspiracies outlined above sent shock waves through the establishment in Washington, and while it is possible we are seeing another trafficking cover-up happening again today, one should consider that thus far, there have been no victims found to have been abused regarding Comet Ping Pong or any other business wrapped up within the online pizzagate theory.A Franklin Cover-up documentary called  Conspiracy of Silence  was made and allegedly pulled from circulation following the fallout from a case that also implicated the Catholic founded non-profit orphanage, Boys Town.In a related scandal exposed in 2002, The Boston Globe s Spotlight Team  first revealed that the leader of the Catholic Church in Boston, Cardinal Bernard Law, allowed one of his priests to continue working even though Law knew that Fr. John Geoghan had spent his career sexually assaulting children. The story became so huge, that it led to more than 250 priests being publicly named in abuse allegations, covering some 100 cities in the US and another 100 globally. In 2015, Hollywood released the film Spotlight, which chronicled the tales of abuse.Similarly in the UK, over the past few years, an investigation into the Jimmy Savile abuse scandal  was compounded by BBC s own cover-up of the serious claims. The Savile scandal and cover-up featured many whistleblowers and victims coming forward, and also showed a high degree of cover-up at the police department level as well.While observing the connective aspects of various scandals, DC s political scene has also revealed some telling business and establishment links which raise even more interesting questions   MEDIA MACHINE    Democratic political operative David Brock. (Image Source: twitter)There are some interesting aspects of pizzagate which have been almost untouched by internet sleuths.Below we ll take a look at George Soros-funded Media Matters and its director David Brock and examine his past connections and tangential links to both Barney Frank and James Alefantis Media Matters  & Political PlotsIn 1997, political operative David Brock was once a right-wing media hit-man so to speak, writing conservative op-ed s taking on college campus  marxists  and was an investigative reporter for the weekly news magazine Insight on the News (published by The Washington Times). Some time later, Brock became a Democratic political operative and Soros righthand man at Media Matters.Some reports also claim that Brock (seen on the left with Barney Frank) joined on with Sidney Blumenthal and the Clintons simply over money   but others suggest a different tale   one that took place during the course of Brock completing a somewhat strange book entitled  The Seduction of Hillary Clinton,  which deflected controversies aimed at the Clintons and took a softball approach to Hillary s political evolution.Over the years, many critics have questioned Brock s hidden Washington past and his unlikely political evolution Blackmail? Brock, Grey & AlefantisIn 2012, FOX NEWS revealed the following, as Media Matters chief David Brock paid a former domestic partner $850,000 after being threatened with damaging information involving the organization s donors and the IRS   a deal that Brock later characterized as a blackmail payment, according to legal documents obtained by FoxNews.com. Brock s bitter separation from William Grey led to accusations of blackmail and harassment: In an acrimonious lawsuit settled at the end of last year, Brock accused William Grey of making repeated threats to expose him to the  scorn or ridicule of his employees, donors and the press in demanding money and property.  Brock claimed in legal papers that he sold a Rehoboth Beach, Del., home he once shared with Grey in order to meet Grey s demands, which he called  blackmail  in the lawsuit. Brock s legal trouble with Grey appeared to be the result of a severed relationship after 10 years, with Brock ending the relationship, he began dating Washington, D.C., restaurant impresario James Alefantis,  according to reports.Considering how Brock and Grey s end played out according to court records revealed by the media, one might consider that this latest DC drama unfolding in the form of pizzagate, could also be the result of bad-jacketing (as suggested by the blog auticulture) after a bitter love triangle involving the trio   in the lead up to one of the most contentious US presidential elections in history.According to Ward Churchill s,  Agents of Repression: The FBI s Secret Wars Against the Black Panther Party and the American Indian Movement: Snitch-jacketing or bad-jacketing refers to the practice creating suspicion   through the spread of rumors, manufacture of evidence etc Bad-jacketing had been a technique employed by the FBI under their program COINTELPRO.Domestically in America, the FBI created the counter-intelligence program known as COINTELPRO, to influence, disrupt and coerce political factions from the inside out, infiltrating countless political groups and movements. According to reports these included the following,  The Black Panther Party, The Communist Party of America, the Ku Klux Klan, the Socialist Workers Party, the New Left, the Students for a Democratic Society, the American Indian Movement, the Chicano Movement, the Puerto Rican Liberation Movement, Communist groups, anti-war organizations, Hollywood stars sympathetic to these groups, and civil rights leaders. Between 1956 and 1971 the FBI s controversial program influenced and radicalized hundreds of left-wing and right-wing groups to control and neutralize political dissidents across America. No part of politics was immune to COINTELPRO.Is it possible that a DC love triangle that once involved Brock, Grey & Alefantis, led to a PR-driven form (as a part of Brock s Correct the Record or something else) of bad-jacketing which then cascaded through the Democratic Party elite, ultimately taking its triangle shape   through the use of pizzagate and others? MEDIA CONTROL    (Photo illustration redesigned by 21WIRE s Shawn Helton)Censorship & the  Fake News  Witch-HuntIn early November, just prior to the US presidential election, CNN published an article stating the following: A recent BuzzFeed study of  hyperpartisan Facebook pages  found that these pages  are consistently feeding their millions of followers false or misleading information. Three weeks later in a republished article written by Robert Parry from Consortium News, it was disclosed that major media companies had been heavily involved in pushing the fake news meme, citing many election-based posts made online as the culprit: In its lead editorial on Sunday, The New York Times decried what it deemed  The Digital Virus Called Fake News  and called for Internet censorship to counter this alleged problem, taking particular aim at Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg for letting  liars and con artists hijack his platform. Below is a passage from a recent report filed at 21WIRE discussing the fake news witch-hunt, which has now led to new calls for internet censorship: Over the past month, The Washington Post published an irresponsible propaganda piece that blamed the 2016 US election results on  fake news  dispensed via sophisticated Russian propaganda. These accusations of course were completely unfounded, deliberately feeding into a paranoid trial by media format that is no doubt echoed by US government sock puppet accounts that act as a digital firing squad by redirecting public perception.While the US mainstream media contends that  fake news  somehow altered the 2016 presidential election cycle, it s important to remember that the US government has some pedigree here, having been behind the creation of bogus social media accounts and personalities for years now.Back in 2011, The UK s Guardian reported that the US government via CENTCOM, was looking to gain a foothold over information shared on the internet through fake online personal accounts: The discovery that the US military is developing false online personalities   known to users of social media as  sock puppets    could also encourage other governments, private companies and non-government organisations to do the same.The Centcom contract stipulates that each fake online persona must have a convincing background, history and supporting details, and that up to 50 US-based controllers should be able to operate false identities from their workstations  without fear of being discovered by sophisticated adversaries . This is just one example. Who really knows how widespread this practice is.You can expect a litany of allegations to continue from the mainstream, along with their faux war on fake news sites which has been used deliberately to discredit and frame genuine investigative analysis in alternative media, its intended target. Western media s anti-Russian hyperbole has morphed and broadened somewhat, thanks to Facebook, Google and Twitter and the alphabet establishment news agencies, Washington has a new go-to scapegoat joining the tired old Russian  hack  meme   independent media. SEE ALSO: Washington Post Sloppy  Journalism  Blames Russia for  Fake News  Crisis and Trump s Win, While Pushing Neo-McCarthyismIt appears as though there has been a coordinated effort to combine the latest run of conspiracies in America, whether it s the fake news meme, the  Russian election-hack  meme or pizzagate    they all seem to be have been used to undermine key aspects of internet freedom.Below is an interview with James Alefantis featured on Megyn Kelly s Kelly File discussing the highly speculative pizzagate theory. During Kelly s interview, the focus centered around unsubstantiated claims levied at the business owner and his place of business Here s a very detailed analysis provided by researcher David Icke discussing the multi-layered theories wrapped up in the pizzagate conspiracy and its relation to censorship and so-called  fake news In ConclusionThe overtly conspiracy-tinged pizzagate theory, emerged like a hydra out of sub-Reddit and 4chan threads and Twitter posts, while catapulting only the most sensational aspects into the mainstream matrix. The story conjures many Hollywood and government tales of cover-up, murder, abuse and deception throughout history.The perceived presence of a politically charged Satanic sex-cult intertwined within a paedophilic abuse ring, seemed to have only enhanced the narrative for many internet-sleuths, who in some cases, held steadfast to a biased guilt-by-association meme   even in the absence of any known victims, and without any forensic evidence or any eye-witness testimony of a crime.This is not to suggest that VIP child sex rings and ritual abuse cases do not exist in America. One such murder spree, known as the  Son of Sam  case, was reopened in part due to evidence of Satanic cult activity and multiple offenders. Although the findings were suspended, the case was never officially closed.While people should certainly have the ability to express their opinion about pizzagate without shame or ridicule, using biased, misleading or fraudulent information (in some cases dispensing defamatory or threatening remarks) in a rapid-fire echo chamber, could ultimately undermine any legitimate investigation if there truly was a crime committed here, or elsewhere. If that is the ultimate legacy of pizzagate, then it is a devastating self-inflicted wound for the alternative media.While it s true that sites like Reddit and Twitter could cite the 1996 Communications Decency Act, as a protection for hosting defamatory information posts by users, there could be real consequences for those deliberately posting defamatory content with no real evidence to substantiate such allegations.Another risk with a whirlwind like this, is that it would be very easy for an agent provocateur to post a slick YouTube video or craft an article   with the intention of whipping-up a storm that could be used to damage independent media as a whole. It s very possible that this has already happened at some point over the life of the internet, and it s certain that the powers that be will use this tactic again in the future.Above all however, it s important to separate the fallout from the pizzagate story and other fake news allegations, as those in mainstream media such as The New York Times, The Washington Post and the self-anointed  fact checker Snopes.com, seem to have propped up this pizzeria conspiracy as a battle cry to introduce the idea of new internet censorship protocols.It s anybody s guess what will be the final outcome of the #Pizzagate phenomenon, but for the moment, it seems to have collapsed under the weight of its own mountain of digital ash. Maybe that was the idea. READ MORE MSM LIES AT: 21st Century Wire MSM FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE  SUBSCRIBE NOW & BECOME A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",Middle-east,"December 28, 2016"

The media has covered these horrors up for years, and even after Donald Trump dared reveal these horrors, the rape-deniers in the media continue to cover them up. The media is covering up all kinds of horrific statistic regarding illegal aliens. Before we get to those, let s start with why.To Democrats and their media allies, a few hundred raped children a year is seen as a small price to pay for the political benefits that come with an unsecure border. Mexicans vote 3-to-1 for Democrats.Of the 862 alien sex offenders deported by the Texas-based offices, about 27 percent were convicted of sex offenses against children. -BreitbartYesterday in Las Vegas, a Hispanic immigrant was been arrested for allegedly raping a toddler in Las Vegas. The man accused of raping a 4-year-old girl and videotaping the entire sexual assault on his cellphone has been placed on an immigrant detainer. It is not currently known if the accused child rapist is a legal or illegal immigrant.Julio Cesar Medrano, 23, also goes by the alias,  Julio Rodriguez.  The Las Vegas resident was arrested on child rape charges on April 21. The sexual assault happened on April 3, according to the time stamp on the 30-second cellphone video, police investigators.Julio Medrano was arrested after a woman found the video appearing to depict the immigrant raping the child. A tattoo on the hand of the man in the alleged child rape video aided Las Vegas law enforcement investigators in identifying the suspect, the Daily Mail reports.Julio Medrano has been charged with seven criminal counts in connection with the child sexual assault case. The charges levied against the Hispanic immigrant include sexual assault against a child younger than 14, child abuse or neglect, producing and possessing child pornography, possession of a dangerous weapon, and carrying a concealed knife without a permit, according to the Clark County Detention Center online records database.For entire story  Inquisitr",left-news,"May 6, 2017"
4788, WATCH: Colbert Found Trump’s Pro-Police Brutality Cop He Won’t Stop Talking About,"As Twitter so perfectly demonstrated, Republican presidential nominee Donald trump has a problem with citing his sources. One example of this is his recent claim that he met with a  top cop  in the Chicago Police Department who said that police officers need to have more freedom to be  tougher  with suspected criminals. All I know is this,  Trump said.  I went to a top police officer in Chicago, who is not the police chief, and I could see by the way he was dealing with his people, he was a rough, tough guy, they respected him greatly. The claim appears to be a total fabrication by Trump, as the Chicago PD denies any knowledge of such a meeting occurring.The claim provided the Late Show all the material they needed for a hilarious lesson on the importance of being able to cite your sources when making claims on the campaign trail.Colbert says that the Late Show did some digging and found the police officer who Trump claims to have spoken to. That s when Colbert introduces  Officer Rod Johnson  to the audience. Officer Johnson, who is a  rough tough cop  that  isn t afraid to get down and dirty  says that he told Trump that,  there are some naughty people out there who need to be in cuffs.

19411,FACEBOOK HIRES PORN STAR And Husband Accused Of Defrauding “Snopes” Website To “Fact-Check” Mostly Conservative Websites,"Facebook has announced plans to check for  fake news  using a series of organizations to assess whether stories are true  One of them is a website called Snopes.com which claims to be one of the web s  essential resources  and  painstaking, scholarly and reliable It was founded by husband-and-wife Barbara and David Mikkelson, who used a letterhead claiming they were a non-existent society to start their research Now they are divorced   with Barbara claiming in legal documents he embezzled $98,000 of company money and spent it on  himself and prostitutes In a lengthy and bitter legal dispute he is claiming to be underpaid and demanding  industry standard  or at least $360,000 a year The two also dispute what are basic facts of their case   despite Snopes.com saying its  ownership  is committed to  accuracy and impartiality Snopes.com founder David Mikkelson s new wife Elyssa Young is employed by the website as an administrator She has worked as an escort and porn actress and despite claims website is non-political ran as a Libertarian for Congress on a  Dump Bush  platform Its main  fact checker  is Kimberly LaCapria, whose blog  ViceVixen  says she is in touch with her  domme side  and has posted on Snopes.com while smoking potOne of the websites Facebook is to use to arbitrate on  fake news  is involved in a bitter legal dispute between its co-founders, with its CEO accused of using company money for prostitutes.Snopes.com will be part of a panel used by Facebook to decide whether stories which users complain about as potentially  fake  should be considered  disputed .But the website s own troubles and the intriguing choice of who carries out its  fact checks  are revealed by DailyMail.com, as one of its main contributors is disclosed to be a former sex-blogger who called herself  Vice Vixen .Snopes.com will benefit from Facebook s decision to allow users to report items in their newsfeed which they believe to be  fake .It is asking a number of organizations to arbitrate on items which are reported or which Facebook staff think may not be genuine, and decide whether they should be marked as  disputed .The others include ABC News, the Associated Press and  fact-checking  websites including Politifact.com.Now a DailyMail.com investigation reveals that Snopes.com s founders, former husband and wife David and Barbara Mikkelson, are embroiled in a lengthy and bitter legal dispute in the wake of their divorce.He has since remarried, to a former escort and porn actress who is one of the site s staff members.They are accusing each other of financial impropriety, with Barbara claiming her ex-husband is guilty of  embezzlement  and suggesting he is attempting a  boondoggle  to change tax arrangements, while David claims she took millions from their joint accounts and bought property in Las Vegas.The Mikkelsons founded the site in 1995. The couple had met in the early 1990s on a folklore-themed online message board, and married before setting up the site.Profiles of the website disclose that for some time before it was set up, the couple had posed as  The San Fernardo Valley Folklore Society , using its name on letterheads, even though it did not exist.A profile for the Webby Awards published in October describes it as  an entity dreamed up to help make the inquiries seem more legit .David Mikkeleson told the Los Angeles Times in 1997:  When I sent letters out to companies, I found I got a much better response with an official-looking organization s stationery. In 2015, their marriage ended in divorce   but a bitter legal dispute continues.Both stayed on as co-owners of Snopes   which is registered under its legal name of Bardav, Inc. and were its sole board members.Legal filings seen by DailyMail.com detail a lengthy financial and corporate dispute which stretches long after their divorce, and which one lawyer describes as  contentious  in court documents.In the filings, Barbara, 57, has accused her former husband, 56, of  raiding the corporate business Bardav bank account for his personal use and attorney fees  without consulting her.She also claimed he embezzled $98,000 from the company over the course of four years  which he expended upon himself and the prostitutes he hired .When contacted by the Dailymail.com, David said he was legally prohibited from discussing his ex-wife s allegations. I d love to respond, but unfortunately the terms of a binding settlement agreement preclude me from publicly discussing the details of our divorce,  he said. Barbara Mikkelson said:  No comment. In court records, Barbara alleged that her ex-husband removed thousands from their business accounts between April and June of 2016 to pay for trips for him and his  girlfriend .One of the lead fact-checkers, Kim LaCapria, has also been a sex-and-fetish blogger who went by the pseudonym  Vice Vixen. She described her blog as a lifestyle website  with a specific focus on naughtiness, sin, carnal pursuits, and general hedonism and bonne vivante-ery. She regularly provided intimate advice and reviewed sex toys, including a vibrating wand that  drives boys mad. If you are doing something to your fella, and you apply this to the base of his cash-and-prizes while you carry on, he will scream and perhaps cry,  she wrote.She also recommended one book with the review:  How to Tell A Naked Man What To Do seems like the perfect how-to for the dominatrix-in-waiting, or any girl looking to get in touch with her domme side. Mine, I wish I could shut her up sometimes, but there you go. In others posts, LaCapria claimed to be  addicted to smutty HP [Harry Potter] fanfic. Describing her day-off activities on another blog, she wrote that she  played scrabble, smoked pot, and posted to Snopes.  She added,  That s what I did on my day  on,  too. David Mikkelson told the Dailymail.com that Snopes does not have a  standardized procedure  for fact-checking  since the nature of this material can vary widely.  He said the process  involves multiple stages of editorial oversight, so no output is the result of a single person s discretion. He also said the company has no set requirements for fact-checkers because the variety of the work  would be difficult to encompass in any single blanket set of standards. Accordingly, our editorial staff is drawn from diverse backgrounds; some of them have degrees and/or professional experience in journalism, and some of them don t,  he added.For entire story- Daily Mail",left-news,"Dec 21, 2016"

7556, Texas Gun Nuts Open Fire On Democratic Office Of Gun Control-Supporting Senator,"The Houston Police Department and Texas Rangers are investigating after a gun nut opened fire on the office of Democratic state Senator John Whitmire a day before President Obama is scheduled to speak in Austin.Early Thursday morning around 12:30am, a shooter fired several rounds into the two-story office.  There are bullet slugs everywhere,  Whitmire said.  One lodged in a framed picture. It s pretty amazing. Whitemire, a gun control advocate, surmised that the weapon used in the attack was an AR-15 because the bullets were .223 caliber. No one was harmed in the shooting but Whitmire and his staff along with law enforcement officials are taking the incident seriously. We ll take precautions. But it s part of the job, unfortunately, in this day and time,  Whitmire said.  They are checking in this general area to see if anyone else received any gunfire. We don t know yet. I don t know yet. The targeting of Whitmire s office occurred the day before President Obama is scheduled to appear at the South by Southwest tech and music festival on Friday where he is delivered a keynote address.Upon hearing of Obama s schedule, Texas open carry gun nuts stated their desire to attend the event with their guns to hand out pro-law literature. But one of the gun nuts had a different idea for what his buddies should do. If you get a clear shot, please fire for effect!  conservative gun nut Kriss Elliot wrote on Facebook.So not only has the Texas open carry obsession resulted in violence against a Democratic office, it has resulted in gun nuts actually wanting to assassinate President Obama, and now it s much easier for them to do this because they are legally allowed to carry deadly firearms in public view.Make no mistake, these people belong in jail or at the very least an FBI watch list, but as long as Republicans control the state it will remain an exaggerated and embarrassing version of the Wild West.Featured Image: OnlyInYourState.com",News,"March 11, 2016"
1548, Pastor Caught Trump’s Spiritual Advisor Stealing From Her Own Church Collection Plate,"It seems that Donald Trump s spiritual advisor is exactly as ethical as he is. Paula White, a prosperity gospel minister who prayed at The Donald s inauguration, has regularly been criticized by Trump s evangelical followers as a charlatan who essentially sells tickets to Heaven and other God-related non-products.White sells, for instance, a  resurrection seed    a delivery from a spiritual death sentence   for $1,144 (a number that was totally chosen by God). But apparently, the money she scams from her people by selling a la carte divine services isn t quite enough for White.Hector Gomez, who was a pastor at White s former Without Walls ministry in the 90 s, told HeatStreet that he once saw the  Christian  huckster cherrypicking the offering plate:Hector Gomez, a pastor who worked at Without Walls from 1993 to 2000, told Heat Street that on several occasions, Paula and Randy White invited people to put not only money in the offering plate but valuables, too. Darryl Strawberry, the famed outfielder, once caused a stir by putting his World Series ring in the offering plate and donating it to the church, Randy White told ESPN in 2009. People would give them jewelry, diamonds, watches,  Gomez said. One day, he said, he watched in horror as Paula White sifted through the collection plate after church, picking out the jewelry that looked valuable.White told him to take the less valuable collections to a jeweler who bought second-hand pieces to resell or melt down, he said; he watched her lock up the more valuable jewelry in her desk, and he never saw it again.Gomez said he felt ethically uncomfortable reselling congregants  jewelry. Not only was he unsure about what became of the most valuable items collected, he said; he also felt uneasy asking people for treasured jewelry, especially after his own wife donated a bracelet he d given her when they first got married. It wasn t worth much,  Gomez said.  It was a nice little bracelet. But it has sentimental value.  He said he thought about that bracelet as he watched White sort through the jewelry.  I was so grieved. I was like,  This belongs to the people in the church. They worked very hard.

6390," White House CLOBBERS Texas Lt. Gov Outrage Over Trans Students, And It’s GLORIOUS","If Texas Lt. Governor Dan Patrick (R) thought he was going to get away with being a completely transphobic jerk regarding transgender students using the bathroom, he thought wrong.After President Obama announced that any public school that refused to let a transgender student use a restroom consistent with their identity would run the risk of losing federal funding, Lt. Gov. Patrick lost his damn mind. He went so far as to say: I believe that it is the biggest issue facing families and schools in America since prayer was taken out of public schools. [Obama] has put a policy in place that will divide the country, not along political lines, but along family values and school districts. He says he s going to withhold funding if schools do not follow the policy. Well in Texas, he can keep his 30 pieces of silver. We will not yield to blackmail from the president of the United States. Yes, folks, he s that much of a bigot. Letting transgender individuals pee in the appropriate bathroom has nothing to do with  family values  and everything to do with just letting a person pee. However, many Republicans like to label anything that gives them the heebies jeebies as going against their  values,  so this really shouldn t come as a surprise. They likely used to say the same stuff back when black people wanted to use the same bathrooms as white people. These people are bigots and they re not afraid to make sure everyone knows it, coded language and all.Well, the White House heard what Patrick had to say about President Obama s directive, and hit back  hard. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said: Well I think this does underscore the risk of electing a right-wing radio host to elected statewide office. Patrick, of course, is also known as being a very far-right conservative talk show host before being elected as Lt. Governor.Earnest also said: This is not an enforcement action. This is in response to extensive requests for guidance and for information and advice that have been put forward by school administrators and teachers and in some cases, even parents, who are seeking practical solutions to this challenge And the challenge here is not to isolate anybody, it s not to discriminate against anybody, it s not to make anybody unsafe. It s actually to ensure that our schools are as inclusive and respectful and safe as they can possibly be. He added that many schools would  welcome this guidance and implement it. In the year 2016, you d think there wouldn t still be such backward, myopic thinking that can t embrace life outside a bubble of what one might think a person should be. However, there is, and because there is, the White House is very open to a dialogue to address concerns. After all, most bigotry and discrimination is the result of lack of knowledge and understanding.Dan Patrick is being Dan Patrick. A man who likes to hear himself speak and doesn t seem to care who he hurts along the way. If he thinks the president asking schools to be inclusive and allow students to choose the bathroom of their gender identity at risk of losing funding is blackmail, then he s clearly a bigot who doesn t want to comply.Good on the White House for smacking his clear bigotry down.Featured Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"May 13, 2016"
1838, Trump Is A MONSTROUS Threat To A Vital Government Function That Nobody Is Talking About,"When people talk about the threat that Donald Trump poses to the U.S., they generally talk about things like education, the environment, consumers, workers, immigrants, minorities, and so on. His  Make America Great Again  slogan is nothing more than hot air, and anybody who s been paying attention knows it. But there s one absolutely vital government function that Trump threatens that nobody s talking about. It s a safe bet that most of us actually haven t even thought of it, despite his warning to federal agencies to prepare for massive budget cuts.It s the U.S. Census. And the Census is something we need. Population counts determine the number of U.S. Representatives a state gets, and they also determine how the states  districts get redrawn. Even states with independent commissions depend on the Census to know how best to draw district lines.Census data is also used for federal programs affecting things like education, veterans  services, rural development, transportation, housing and more. The Census determines the allocation of funding for the following:And so much more, including in the private sector   businesses can use Census data to determine everything from optimal location to understanding both the local labor force and the local consumer population. Of course, most of this is stuff that the Trump administration and the Republican Party see as wastes anyway, but they ll be hard-pressed to actually cut funding for all of this in a budget without facing massive backlash.Hmm. Now that we re thinking about it, maybe sabotaging the Census would be their way of gutting all these programs.That list, while a ton, isn t all. There s also what Trump s stance on immigration could do. ICE has been sweeping cities for undocumented immigrants, even targeting courthouses as immigrants show up for hearings and appointments about pretty much everything. In fact, a judge in Washington State reported hearing that undocumented immigrants are missing court dates, even if they were seeking a protective order against an abuser.We have the growing hate and fear of Muslims to contend with, too   while they aren t being arrested and deported (yet), they could worry that answering the Census will expose sensitive information and make them more vulnerable to harassment and attack.For these reasons, immigrants and other minorities may find themselves far less willing to participate in the 2020 Census. And in communities that have high immigrant and/or minority populations, that could result in bad undercounts. Undercounts that are bad enough could result in districts, especially those that are done by independent commissions, being inadvertently redrawn in ways that don t accurately represent the states  populations.It could also result in impoverished, high-immigrant communities seeing necessary federal dollars drain away from programs they depend on.Now, okay, the Census is still three years away. But Trump s funding cuts have already forced them to scrap plans for some new field offices that would help the Census go more smoothly, and has also forced them to cancel the dry runs they do every decade in the run-up to the actual Census. That tells us that just conducting the 2020 Census is very likely to be problematic.They re asking us to do it online this year (partly as a cost-cutting measure, because of course), which raises cybersecurity concerns and could exacerbate immigrants  and minorities  fears of having ICE come knock at their door, or having asshat racists attack and/or harass them. Following hacks courtesy of everyone from Russia to the Shadow Brokers (who recently hacked the NSA), they re going to have one hell of a time convincing us that our data will be safe and secure.The problems Trump and the GOP are causing for the Census are nothing to shrug at. So much of the way this country is run depends on an accurate Census count, and they re going to have a really difficult time.Featured image by Mark Wilson via Getty Images",News,"April 10, 2017"

[VIDEO],"Did Donald Trump convince Megyn Kelly s loyal fan base that she really isn t so  fair and balanced  after all, or is she just getting worn down by dirty politics?Many news personalities are already worn out covering this year s election, but Kelly has become part of the story. She s survived sustained attacks from Trump by buckling down and focusing on her job, and her primetime show  The Kelly File  has never done better, averaging 2.5 million nightly viewers. In a one-hour conversation, Kelly spoke to Variety for this week s Power of Women issue about Trump, wanting to interview Hillary Clinton and whether she ll remain at Fox News after her contract expires next year.Do you think there s a double standard in the news business when it comes to women? Let me put it to you this way. One of the biggest lessons I ve learned in the past 10 months is we have a long way to go. We as women in the country where we are, how we think of ourselves, what we re willing to accept we have a ton of work to do.Do you think Trump s attacks on you are different because you re a woman? I think the language is very different when he fights with women.Has it been hard for you? It has not been enjoyable. I wish it hadn t happened. I hope it will stop   his focus on me. If he s determined not to stop, there s nothing I can do. I don t like being the story. I think it raises real First Amendment issues. I ve seen what s happened with Michelle Fields [the former Breitbart News reporter allegedly grabbed by Trump s campaign manager] and in my own world, there s another side to this behavior. It poses real risks to the person under attack.What did you think when you read his tweet that you owe him part of your salary? I laughed.Isn t it sexist? I ll leave that to someone else to label. I ll say this. I earn every dime of my salary. I won t be giving it to anyone other than my three children.  The Kelly File  was the No. 1 show [in cable] in the time slot and No. 2 in all of cable news from the time I launched it. Trump called for people to boycott the show repeatedly. The numbers went up. When he realized the boycott had failed, he decided to take credit for the show s success.Has this made it harder to cover him? I don t want to be reporting the news in a way that s fearful, or a way that seeks to curry favor or prove something. It is difficult, because Trump generates a lot of controversy, often intentionally. So you have to cover that as a reporter. I ll channel surf. I ll look at CNN, or I ll look at my pals Bill [Hemmer] and Martha [MacCallum], who are co-hosting my old show. We re the same. I give him no more coverage than the other journalists give him.You asked a series of pointed questions about the lawsuit against Trump University at the last debate you moderated. Why do you think it took the media so long to report about that? I think the media believed that Trump wasn t a serious contender for a long time until it became obvious they were wrong. There is a lot to fact check Trump on that poses challenges. Reporters only have so much time and energy for one particular subject, and I also think with Trump, he s a master strategist at distracting you. If he says something for which he s gotten into real trouble, he ll say something else and the media is quick to run to the next shiny thing.He also doesn t always answer the question he s being asked. It s hard. You have to really stay on it. You need a situation where you pick one topic and you go 10 questions deep I do that on my show. That s how you d have to handle Trump. Listen, it s been a long time since I ve interviewed him.Do you think you ll interview him again? To be honest, every time I prepare an invitation to sit down with him, he attacks me on Twitter or elsewhere. I had always been hoping I could reach out to him at a time when he wasn t angry. I don t think it would be a good interview if he was angry at me but then he never stops with the attacks. I was just about to ask him to sit down with me two weeks ago, but then he started up again out of the blue.After he gave the response about the size of his hands, it was remarkable how you kept a poker face. You know, I haven t seen the debates. I haven t seen the reaction shot. There was definitely a moment where Bret [Baier] and I looked to each other and laughed. Did that just happen?Did you still use Twitter? I barely go on Twitter anymore. I go on for the news. I don t go to the mentions. Whenever I go to the mentions, I m sorry I did.Have you felt supported by Fox News? I have. Fox News has been in a tough position. They care about me and they are not afraid of a fight, but we re in unchartered territory.Have you had many conversations about this with your boss Roger Ailes? I ve had many conversations with him about the situation. I think it s been hard on him, too. I don t think he s enjoyed one piece of this. He can see what happens in my life when Trump starts off. He really wants him to stop, but on the other hand, he s not going to run a news channel that doesn t provide access to the Republican frontrunner for president.Your contract is up after the election. Have you decided if you re staying at Fox News? I haven t.You might not stay? Never say never. I don t know what s going to happen. I ve had a great 12 years here, and I really like working for Roger Ailes. I really like my show, and I love my team. But you know, there s a lot of brain damage that comes from the job. There was probably less brain damage when I worked in the afternoon. I was less well known. I had far less conflict in my life. I also have three kids who are soon going to be school from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. I come to work at 3:30. I like to see my children. Having said that, my boss has been good about working with me to make me happy he knows I m a hard worker. I ve had few problems here where I couldn t talk to him and say,  Can we work something out?,  and come away happy.Would you consider your own talk show? I ve thought about that. I don t know what the market looks like for that in 2016. Many people have tried and failed. I do love covering the news. I just don t think that s the perfect thing for me.What about co-hosting a morning show like  Today ? You have to wake up so early. The alarm goes off at 3:30 a.m. When I did  America s Newsroom,  which started at 9 a.m., I remember saying to the makeup artist at the time,  If you could only know the afternoon me, you d like me so much better.  Listen, this is a fickle business. What if they called me and fired me tomorrow? I have to keep my options open.Fox News won t do that. One never knows.

5474, This Liberal Group Found The BEST Way To Ruin Trump’s Convention (IMAGE),"The Republican National Convention was already shaping up to be a nightmare, and for Donald Trump and the very few GOPers that are going to be in attendance, it s about to get a lot worse.Pro-LGBT group Planting Peace found the perfect way to troll bigoted Republicans, and they unveiled it earlier today. Directly outside where the RNC in Cleveland will be held next week is a new billboard showing Trump and Ted Cruz, who was once smeared by the business mogul but is now speaking at his convention, seconds away from the grossest make-out fest you ll ever imagine. The caption on the billboard is also perfect: Love Trumps Hate. End Homophobia. Planting PeaceThe timing is perfect   Planting Peace erected the billboard right as the Republican platform committee approved what is being referred to as the GOP s most homophobic party platform yet. To encourage Republicans attending the RNC to actually consider how the party s bigotry might be affecting America s youth, Planting Peace said: We challenge the GOP to think about how many times their children could hear messages like these and not be impacted or question their value and worth? These messages sink our young people into a spiral of depression and directly correlate to queer youth attempting or actually committing suicide. The blood of these children is on the hands of the anti-LGBT platform of the republican party. Planting Peace is the same non-profit that brought The Equality House, a rainbow-colored house sitting across the street from Westboro Baptist Church, into existence   so it was only appropriate that this equally troll-like statement like this would come from them. Aaron Jackson, the President of Planting Peace, said the sign was meant to attack the GOP s anti-gay agenda: What Donald, Ted and the Republican Party either fail to realize, or realize and just don t seem to care about, is that their words and actions toward our LGBT family especially LGBT children have meaning and impact. LGBT children hear these messages telling them they are nothing but second-class citizens and are left feeling broken or  less than. When children are dying because of negative messages, then it s time to change the message. Planting Peace calls for the immediate change in the Republican party platform with regard to our LGBT family and LGBT rights. Never again shall a negative, hateful message be uttered in the name of  religious freedom.  We are calling for action that brings full, fundamental rights to the LGBT community, and a narrative that empowers LGBT people to live and love freely. This billboard is going to have Trump and his brainless supporters going insane. We can only hope that someone will be able to take a picture of Trump s face when he sees it.Featured image via Gage Skidmore",News,"July 14, 2016"
2476, Kellyanne Conway Lashes Out After Alma Mater Blasts Her For Being A Liar,"Kellyanne Conway, who serves as a senior adviser to Donald Trump, is a connoisseur of  alternative facts.  In other words, she lies so much she even believes herself. But don t call her a liar, or she ll freak out. Conway is on the offensive today after the president of her alma mater called her out for repeatedly trying to sell falsehoods to the American people as truth.Trinity Washington University President Patricia McGuire blasted Conway for her lies in a blog titled On lies and the truth we must tell.  She said Conway was  part of a team that thinks nothing of shaping and spreading a skein of lies as a means to secure power. Presidential Counselor Kellyanne Conway, Trinity Class of 1989, has played a large role in facilitating the manipulation of facts and encouraging the grave injustice being perpetrated by the Trump Administration s war on immigrants among many other issues. She is one of President Trump s primary spokespersons, an almost daily figure on cable news shows,  McGuire wrote.   Some people admire her staunch advocacy for her client s positions, and others applaud the fact that she was the first woman to manage a successful presidential campaign. But in fact, as is true of many of President Trump s statements, her advocacy on his behalf is often at variance with the truth. Ms. Conway invented the now-infamous phrase  alternative fact,  to defend Trump s claims about the size of crowds at his inauguration, a thinly-veiled autocratic scheme to try to claim that the Trump inauguration drew the biggest crowd in history when, in fact, it was on the smaller side,  she continued.  Ms. Conway has been part of a team that thinks nothing of shaping and spreading a skein of lies as a means to secure power. Perhaps the  Bowling Green Massacre  comment was truly a mistake, as she claims, but she repeated that canard on three different occasions as an explanation for why the travel ban, an executive order that clearly discriminates against Muslims, was necessary. When the Washington Post informed Conway of McGuire s comments, she didn t take it well at all. True to form, she lashed out and slammed not only McGuire s wise words, but also her fellow alumni. Because why not? It s a disappointment to have the president of the university lift up other Trinity graduates who have a casual relationship with the truth,  Conway said. She then whined that McGuire didn t even have  the courtesy of calling or emailing me to ask what I meant on any given occasion. Without addressing the fact that she has been running around making up the truth as she goes along, including the Bowling Green massacre that never happened, Conway added that she has given the school lots of money over the years. My money was good,  she noted. Apparently, writing a check means that no one is allowed to call you out for spouting lies to defend a demagogue. Sounds totally legit.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"February 18, 2017"
18524,FLORIDA MOTHER Allows Baby To Be Bitten By Snake…Then Laughs In Sick VIRAL VIDEO,"A Highlands County woman could be charged with a felony after investigators say she allowed a toddler to be bitten by a small snake as a lesson, then posted the video to Facebook.The sheriff s office released the video Tuesday.  They say it shows Chartelle St. Laurent presenting a Tupperware container to a 1-year-old girl, whom they did not name, at her Sebring home.  Inside the container is a 14-inch red rat snake, which strikes at the reaching girl.As the girl starts crying, a female voice in the background   identified by detectives as St. Laurent   starts to laugh.According to the charging affidavit, St. Laurent told deputies that she had grown up interacting with snakes and reptiles  of all sorts  with her father, and admitted that she allowed the girl to be bitten to teach her a lesson. As she has observed poisonous snakes, including coral snakes, at the property before, Chartelle St. Laurent elected to take the opportunity of finding the juvenile non-poisonous red rat snake to expose [the girl] to,  the report stated.St. Laurent claimed that she allowed herself to be bitten by the snake first in order to  ensure no injury would be caused  to the girl.  Indeed, the report noted that there were  no marks or injury  to the toddler.   FOX 13",left-news,"Jun 6, 2017"

7663, Costco Raises Minimum Wage For Workers As Republicans Continue To Do Nothing,"Costco cares more about the American workforce than Republicans do.A few years ago, Costco answered the call to help struggling workers by raising the wages of their own employees to $12 an hour, nearly a full $5 increase above the federal minimum wage that House and Senate Republicans refuse to raise for the rest of the American people.The results swiftly proved that rewarding your employees and increasing their morale is a good business decision that propels a company forward and turns it into a more competitive one.As other corporations like Walmart saw sales sink, the quarterly income of Costco soared ahead.And now Costco is betting on their employees again by raising their wages by another dollar per hour.Costco announced the wage hike on Thursday in a move that could affect a large number of the 117,000 employees who work for the company.The move not only appears to be Costco s way of rewarding their employees, it appears to also be an answer to Walmart s grudging decision to raise wages for their own workers earlier this year.By raising wages for their own employees, Costco is competing with Walmart to draw new applicants as well as retain current workers.But Costco, unlike Walmart, has always treated their employees with dignity and respect.According to the Huffington Post,Costco has a reputation for being one of the better low-wage employers. It pays slightly more than its competitors (even before the wage increase), closes its doors for major holidays like Thanksgiving and Independence Day and provides health benefits to most of its employees, even those who make an hourly wage.Meanwhile, Republicans in Congress continue to refuse to raise the federal minimum wage to help all American workers across the nation, which has resulted in states and cities raising wages on their own to address the struggle minimum wage workers have faced for decades.Most recently, the state of Oregon passed the highest minimum wage in the nation. In the next few years, Oregonians can expect to make up to $14.50 per hour, which is double the federal minimum wage.Now if only Republicans would stop obeying orders from their corporate masters, perhaps the rest of the American people could get the raise they need to take better care of their families without having to struggle near as much. Alas, it will probably require replacing them with Democrats to make it happen.Featured image from Wikimedia",News,"March 6, 2016"
7377, John Oliver Successfully Turns Trump’s ‘Plan’ For A Wall Into A Pile Of Decaying Pig Sh*t (VIDEO),"When it comes to Donald Trump, there s really not much you can believe that comes out of his mouth except for what can only be assumed is a putrid odor, and this is explained by the fact that he talks out of his ass.Beautifully proving this point was none other than Last Week Tonight s John Oliver in a segment utterly dismantling Trump s plan for a border wall with Mexico.Point by point, down to the size, capability, location, and price tag, Oliver successfully turns Trump s plan into a decaying pile of pig shit. It s absolute nonsense, and better plans have been constructed on the back of a napkin at Chuck-E-Cheese by a desperate father brainstorming his escape from the chaos.However, knowing that this  great wall  is pretty much one of the few things Trump talks about, Oliver said: The border wall is one of the few policy proposals Trump has talked about in detail, so instead of mocking or dismissing it out of hand, tonight let s take a serious proposal by a serious presidential candidate seriously. It was then that the dismantling began, and there was absolutely no refuting it. And no matter how much the wall costs, Oliver points out that according to the Sierra Club,  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that wall maintenance costs will exceed the initial construction costs within seven years  He then used this brilliant comparison: It s a big, dumb thing that only gets more expensive over time. It s like getting a pet walrus: You think it s stupid now, wait until you learn what a bucket of sea cucumbers costs. You ve not prepared for that! Which pretty much sums up the realism of the wall and how it s going to be built and maintained, because Mexico has made it damn clear they re not going to be the ones paying for it. And if you need proof that this wall is just simply never going to happen, the Washington Post fact checked everything right here.Trump has no plans to actually build this wall. He has no plans for anything. He s talking out of his ass, and because so many Americans are racist shiteaters, they gleefully consume every last ounce of his poppycock.Kudos to Oliver for this brilliant takedown. Well f*cking done.Featured image via video screen capture",News,"March 21, 2016"

515, Steve Mnuchin’s Spoiled Wife Just Went Apesh**t Over Criticism From A Random Instagram User (IMAGE),"Donald Trump s Treasury Secretary, former hedge funder and Goldman Sachs guy Steve Mnuchin, is not having a good week. First, he was pressured by hundreds of his fellow Yale graduates to resign from Trump s cabinet after the orange wannabe dictator s disgraceful comments following the white supremacist violence in Charlottesville, Virginia. Mnuchin, who is Jewish, showed that he s willing to lick Trump s ass just like everyone else in that kleptocracy, was defiant and even had the gall to defend Trump   despite the fact that if those Nazis Trump was defending had their way, Mnuchin would be dead.Now, Mnuchin s wife, a spoiled Scottish actress by the name of Louise Linton, is in hot water over an Instagram post. The hullabalu started when she posted a photo of herself and her husband riding pretty in a government plane on our dime, and posted the following hashtags: Great #daytrip to #Kentucky! #nicest #people #beautiful #countryside #rolandmouret pants #tomford sunnies, #hermesscarf #valentinorockstudheels #valentino #usa Of course, she s posting about brands even upper middle class people can t usually afford. Nevermind that, though   Ms. Spoiled Brat is going to show how absolutely clueless she and everyone else in that government is when it comes to the lives of average Americans.Of course, Linton s transgressions didn t go unnoticed, and another user,  Jenni M,  posted: Glad we could pay for your little getaway. #deplorable That s when Mnuchin s wife lost her shit. She posted a tirade against the user for simply pointing out the obvious. Linton responded in a nasty post: cute! .Aw!! Did you think this was a personal trip?! Adorable! Do you think the US govt paid for our honeymoon or personal travel?! Lololol. Have you given more to the economy than me and my husband? Either as an individual earner in taxes OR in self sacrifice to your country? I m pretty sure we paid more taxes toward our day  trip  than you did. Pretty sure the amount we sacrifice per year is a lot more than you d be willing to sacrifice if the choice was yours. You re adorably out of touch. Thanks for the passive aggressive nasty comment.

I think it s ludicrous,  she opined.  Because we have to make up our minds. Either we want to have segregation or integration. If we don t want segregation then we need to get rid of channels like BET and the BET Awards and the [NAACP] Image Awards, where you are only awarded if you are black. So you say there should not be a BET channel?  Fox News host Steve Doocy wondered. No, just like there shouldn t be a Black History Month,  Dash replied.  You know, we re Americans. Period. That s it. Are you saying there shouldn t be a Black History Month because there isn t a White History Month?  Doocy pressed. Exactly!  Dash insisted.According to Dash, the real problem was that Hollywood s support of President Barack Obama had not inspired filmmakers to create more black roles. We ve had a president who is black in office for the past eight years, who gets most of his funding from the liberal elite in Hollywood,  she said.  Yet, there are not very many roles for people of color. How can that be and why is it just now being addressed?  Via: RAW Story ",politics,"Jan 20, 2016"

6384, FINALLY: Sheriff Joe Ruled In Contempt Over Racial Profiling,"A Maricopa Country judge has finally stood up to the vile, crooked, racist Sheriff Joe Arpaio and charged him along with three of his top cronies with being in contempt. His crime? He hasn t stopped his illegal and unconstitutional racial profiling of Hispanics.Thanks to that darn liberal activist group the ACLU, Arpaio will be in hot water if he continues to practice his clearly racist policies.Judge G. Murray Snow, after a lengthy yearlong investigation after the ruling in Ortega Melendres v. Arpaio, concluded that Arpaio was in contempt on one charge while Chief Deputy Jerry Sheridan was found in contempt on two counts, and retired Chief Brian Sands and Lt. Joe Sousa each were found in contempt of one.In the 162-page ruling, Judge Snow wrote:In short, the Court finds that the Defendants have engaged in multiple acts of misconduct, dishonesty, and bad faith with respect to the Plaintiff class and the protection of its rights.The three contempt charges stem from three requests from Judge Snow that Arpaio and his band of thugs refused to comply with:According to ArizonaCentral:Snow found that deputies had detained and turned over to federal authorities at least 157 individuals who had not committed state crimes, in violation of his order.Snow said both Arpaio and Sheridan made numerous misstatements under oath.Not only did Sheriff Joe and his deputies knowingly fail to comply with a court ruling, they openly flaunted it and thought that they were above the law.Now the Department of Justice is getting involved. After slapping down Sheriff Joe last year over his racial profiling, the DOJ will work closely with Snow to implement proper sanctions. Should Snow feel so inclined, he may refer the case to criminal contempt. Perhaps jail time might await the Sheriff? One can only hope.But while we wait for this monstrosity to be put in prison, the people of Arizona are faced with another option: voting him out of office. This is an election year, and Sheriff Joe is running. Every election his support shrinks. In 2000, Arpaio won with 66 percent of the vote. In 2012, he garnered only 51 percent.With Trump on the rise as the GOP s newest face, Hispanic voter registration has spiked all across the southwest, including Arizona   something that should scare Arpaio and his cronies to their core. This is what happens when you rule with fear instead of the common good.Now it s 2016, and this man s reign of terror and shame must come to an end. Let the courts deal with him in court, and let s have the voters throw the bum out of office once and for all.Featured image via Ethan Miller/Getty Images",News,"May 14, 2016"
19871,CHAMPION OF WOMEN? How Hillary Used Private Investigators To Destroy Women Her Political Prize Husband Was Sleeping With: “We have to destroy her story”,"Hillary won t be able to claim a vast right-wing conspiracy when she sees the article the left-leaning New York Times published. The article outlines how Hillary aggressively pursued the women her husband willingly chose to have sex with while he was married to her. Hillary never considered the women her philandering husband had sexual relations with were merely victims of a serial sexual abuser. He was her ticket to the ultimate power. The truth of the matter is, Hillary destroyed these women and protected her sexual predator husband, because having the ultimate political power was more important to her than the victims her husband discarded like yesterday s trash. This is the woman who is to be held up as an example for our daughters? This is the woman who young girls on college campuses say they ll vote for because she has matching genitalia? Hillary s true story needs to be told. She is nothing more than a two-bit opportunist who has clung to a charismatic serial sexual abuser of women for one reason, and one reason only to get to this point her ultimate goal the first serious female candidate for President of the United States. As usual with the Clinton s anyone who is harmed on their way up the political ladder, is of little or no consequence to them Last week, Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, criticized Mrs. Clinton over Mr. Clinton s affairs and her response to them, and said he might talk more about the issue in the final weeks before the election.That could be a treacherous strategy for Mr. Trump, given his own past infidelity and questionable treatment of women. Many voters, particularly women, might see Mrs. Clinton being blamed for her husband s conduct.It could also remind voters of a searing period in American history, and in Mrs. Clinton s life.Confronting a spouse s unfaithfulness is painful under any circumstance. For Mrs. Clinton, it happened repeatedly and in the most public of ways, unfolding at the dawn of the 24/7 news cycle, and later in impeachment proceedings that convulsed the nation.Outwardly, she remained stoic and defiant, defending her husband while a progression of women and well-funded conservative operatives accused Mr. Clinton of behavior unbecoming the leader of the free world.But privately, she embraced the Clinton campaign s aggressive strategy of counterattack: Women who claimed to have had sexual encounters with Mr. Clinton would become targets of digging and discrediting   tactics that women s rights advocates frequently denounce.The campaign hired a private investigator with a bare-knuckles reputation who embarked on a mission, as he put it in a memo, to impugn Ms. Flowers s  character and veracity until she is destroyed beyond all recognition. In a pattern that would later be repeated with other women, the investigator s staff scoured Arkansas and beyond, collecting disparaging accounts from ex-boyfriends, employers and others who claimed to know Ms. Flowers, accounts that the campaign then disseminated to the news media.By the time Mr. Clinton finally admitted to  sexual relations  with Ms. Flowers, years later, Clinton aides had used stories collected by the private investigator to brand her as a  bimbo  and a  pathological liar. Mrs. Clinton s level of involvement in that effort, as described in interviews, internal campaign records and archives, is still the subject of debate. By some accounts, she gave the green light and was a motivating force; by others, her support was no more than tacit assent.What is clear is that Mrs. Clinton was in a difficult spot. She was aware that her husband had cheated earlier in their marriage, but by her telling, she also believed him when he denied the accusations levied by Ms. Flowers and others.Mickey Kantor, the chairman of Bill Clinton s 1992 campaign, said that Mrs. Clinton wanted to separate fact from fiction and to size up the women making the claims. Let s say the woman has some not-helpful things that she has done in the past,  Mr. Kantor said.  Wouldn t you want to know that, and evaluate it? Mrs. Clinton and her husband declined to be interviewed, and her campaign did not answer questions about her support of efforts to undermine the women.  The country closed the book on these matters close to 20 years ago, and there is nothing whatsoever new here,  her spokesman, Brian Fallon, said in a statement.Her campaign also released statements from James Carville, Mr. Clinton s top campaign strategist, and two lawyers who worked for Mr. Clinton, saying that Mrs. Clinton had not overseen the counterattacks. Those who took the lead in responding to those attacks at the time have plainly stated that Hillary Clinton did not direct their work,  Mr. Fallon said.Neutralizing the WhispersFour years after Gary Hart fled a presidential race amid speculation about an affair, every accusation of womanizing was viewed as a mortal threat to Mr. Clinton s campaign.Stanley Greenberg, a pollster for the campaign who had strategized with the Clintons in the fall of 1991 about how to handle the rumors of infidelity, recalled Mrs. Clinton s acknowledgment that her husband had strayed. It was an uncomfortable meeting,  Mr. Greenberg said in an interview for an oral history of Mr. Clinton s presidency conducted by the Miller Center at the University of Virginia.  I remember Hillary saying that,  obviously, if I could say no to this question, we would say no, and therefore, there is an issue. Weeks later, their first taste of trouble came in a Penthouse magazine story by a rock groupie named Connie Hamzy, who claimed Mr. Clinton had once propositioned her at a hotel in Little Rock, Ark.Mr. Clinton brushed off the story, saying that Ms. Hamzy had made a sexual advance toward him, George Stephanopoulos, the communications director of the 1992 campaign, recalled in his book,  All Too Human. But Mrs. Clinton demanded action. We have to destroy her story,  she said, according to Mr. Stephanopoulos.In what became a common tactic, affidavits were collected, from an aide and two others who stated that they were with Mr. Clinton at the hotel and that Ms. Hamzy s story was false. (Contacted recently, Ms. Hamzy said she stood by her account.)When the work was done, both Clintons called Mr. Stephanopoulos, together, to offer their thanks.An Explosive AccusationThe Gennifer Flowers story landed like a bomb weeks before the New Hampshire primary.Ms. Flowers, a lounge singer and Arkansas state employee at the time, sold Star magazine her story claiming an affair with Mr. Clinton that had lasted more than 10 years.In a meeting with aides, the Clintons scripted a unified defense that they delivered in the interview on  60 Minutes. With Mrs. Clinton nodding agreement, Mr. Clinton admitted to the TV audience to  causing pain in my marriage,  but denied an affair with Ms. Flowers. Mrs. Clinton professed sympathy for Ms. Flowers, saying she had been caught up in rumors through no fault of her own.But at a news conference the next day, Ms. Flowers reasserted her claims, playing excerpts from her calls with Mr. Clinton. The two could be heard discussing the attention the rumors were getting, and she joked about his sexual talents.Glimpsing the news conference in South Dakota, Mrs. Clinton directed an aide to get Mr. Clinton on the phone, Gail Sheehy, a journalist traveling with her, recalled in a recent interview. It was a reaction of no surprise, but immediate anger and action,  said Ms. Sheehy, who also described her observations in a Vanity Fair article that year.  Not anger at Bill, but at Flowers, the press and Republicans. Back on a plane that night, Mrs. Clinton told Ms. Sheehy that if she were to question Ms. Flowers in front of a jury,  I would crucify her. Weeks later, a small group of campaign aides, along with Mrs. Clinton, met at the governor s mansion in Little Rock, and they made a pivotal decision: They would hire Jack Palladino, a private investigator known for tactics such as making surreptitious recordings and deploying attractive women to extract information.An aide to the campaign, who declined to be publicly identified because the aide had not been authorized to speak for the Clintons, said Mrs. Clinton was among those who had discussed and approved the hiring, which shifted the campaign to a more aggressive posture.Mr. Kantor, the campaign chairman, said he did not know whether Mrs. Clinton had specifically approved Mr. Palladino s employment as the other aide recalled. But he said that she had seen a need for outside help. She believed we had to deal with the issue directly,  Mr. Kantor said.Mr. Palladino, who did not respond to requests for an interview, reported to James Lyons, a lawyer working for the campaign. In a memo that he addressed to Mr. Lyons on March 30, Mr. Palladino proposed a full-court press on Ms. Flowers. Every acquaintance, employer, and past lover should be located and interviewed,  Mr. Palladino wrote.  She is now a shining icon   telling lies that so far have proved all benefit and no cost   for any other opportunist who may be considering making Clinton a target. Soon, Ms. Flowers heard from ex-boyfriends and others who said they had been contacted by a private investigator. They would say that he would try to manipulate them,  Ms. Flowers recalled,  or get them to say things like I was sexually active. Karen Steele, who had worked with Ms. Flowers at the Roy Clark Celebrity Theater in Branson, Mo., was among those who received a visit.  I remember I got questioned about brothers Gennifer and I once dated,  she said.  It wasn t warm and fuzzy. While Mrs. Clinton considered the Lewinsky affair a  personal lapse  by her husband, she gave him credit for trying to break it off and manage someone who was a  narcissistic loony toon,  according to Ms. Blair s papers.Bill Clinton can be seen lying before Grand Jury about sexual relations he had with Monica Lewinsky, a young intern in the Oval Office, for which he was impeached later. Hillary s close friend Diane Blair   a political science professor whose papers were donated to the University of Arkansas Special Collections library   Hillary Clinton credited Bill Clinton with trying to break away from Lewinsky, whom she called a  narcissistic loony toon. :Soon after, Mrs. Clinton expressed pleasure to her friend that she and her husband were able to drive  their adversaries totally nuts  because they did not appear to be suffering.For entire story: New York Times ",left-news,"Oct 4, 2016"
3844," Leslie Knope Writes Powerful, Heartbreaking Letter To America That EVERYONE Should Read","Who doesn t love Leslie Knope? She even wormed her way into the heart of that staunch libertarian Ron Swanson.Parks and Recreation has a beloved place in the hearts of many in America, in fact   especially millennials. And no character is more beloved than Amy Poehler s Leslie Knope.For many fans, it s almost impossible to imagine a reaction to this electoral disaster from the almost annoyingly bubbly Knope   her optimism doesn t seem to have much of a place here. However, while perfectly maintaining the voice of the character, she shows that s not the case. You can read my favorite passage below:Like most people, I deal with tragedy by processing the five stages of grief: Denial, Anger, Bargaining, Depression, and Acceptance. My denial over the election results was intense. My anger was (in Ron s words)  significant.  My bargaining was short, but creative  I offered my soul and the souls of all of my friends in exchange for 60,000 more votes in Milwaukee, to any demon who cared to accept. (Tom told me it was a terrible deal, but I didn t care, in that moment.) My depression I have already mentioned. Which brings us to Acceptance. And here s what I stand on that:No. I do not accept it.I acknowledge that Donald Trump is the President. I understand, intellectually, that he won the election. But I do not accept that our country has descended into the hatred-swirled slop pile that he lives in. I reject out of hand the notion that we have thrown up our hands and succumbed to racism, xenophobia, misogyny, and crypto-fascism. I do not accept that. I reject that. I fight that. Today, and tomorrow, and every day until the next election, I reject and fight that story. I work hard and I form ideas and I meet and talk to other people who feel like me, and we sit down and drink hot chocolate (I have plenty) and we plan. We plan like mofos. We figure out how to fight back, and do good in this infuriating world that constantly wants to bend toward the bad. And we will be kind to each other, and supportive of each other s ideas, and we will do literally anything but accept this as our fate.And let me say something to the young girls who are reading this. Hi, girls. On behalf of the grown-ups of America who care about you and your futures, I am awfully sorry about how miserably we screwed this up. We elected a giant farting T. rex who does not like you, or care about you, or think about you, unless he is scanning your bodies with his creepy T. rex eyes, or trying to physically grab you like a toy his daddy got him (or would have, if his daddy had loved him). (Sorry, that was a low blow.) (Actually, not sorry, I m pissed, and I m on a roll, so zip it, super-ego!) Our President-Elect is everything you should abhor, and fear, in a male role model. He has spent his life telling you, and girls and women like you, that your lives are valueless except as sexual objects. He has demeaned you, and belittled you, and put you in a little box to be looked at and not heard. It is your job, and the job of girls and women like you, to bust out.I highly encourage you to read the rest of it as well   Leslie is exactly right. It s time for us to fight harder than ever.",News,"November 10, 2016"

John McCain withdrew his support for Trump after the bad words he used in a private conversation with another guy. Lindsey Graham got crushed by Trump in the primaries and was a loud voice against his nomination. He eventually changed his mind and offered his support for Trump in the general election against Hillary. John McCain did not change his mind.The recount is over, but there s still time to discredit the legitimacy of Donald J. Trump s landslide election. Who better to help the Democrats, than two RINO s who are at the top of the heap when it comes to draining useless Republicans from  the swamp. South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham (R) said Wednesday he would lead a charge to investigate Russia s interference in the U.S. election and hacks on the Democratic Party. I think [Donald] Trump should take a real tough tone with Russia, because if he doesn t, you re going to allow Russia to begin to break apart alliances,  Graham told CNN s Manu Raju.The Republican senator also said he hoped to use his leadership role on two subcommittees to launch a deeper investigation of Russia s hacks, CNN reported. Graham chairs the State, Foreign Operations and Related Programs subcommittee and the Crime and Terrorism subcommittee.Raju said Graham told him that he and Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), chair of the Armed Services Committee, will travel to Eastern Europe to investigate Russian meddling in other countries  elections.During the campaign, Graham was a strong GOP critic of Trump, including on his friendlier stance toward Russia, and chose to vote instead for independent candidate Evan McMullin.  The HillThe Obama administration clearly stated that they saw NO evidence of outside election tampering in the general election.On November 26, 2016 the Obama administration said it has seen no evidence of hackers tampering with the 2016 presidential election, even as recount proceedings began in Wisconsin. We stand behind our election results, which accurately reflect the will of the American people,  a senior administration official told POLITICO late Friday. The federal government did not observe any increased level of malicious cyber activity aimed at disrupting our electoral process on election day,  the official added.  We believe our elections were free and fair from a cybersecurity perspective. Yet yesterday this story appeared in the New York Times: WASHINGTON   American intelligence agencies have concluded with  high confidence  that Russia acted covertly in the latter stages of the presidential campaign to harm Hillary Clinton s chances and promote Donald J. Trump, according to senior administration officials.They based that conclusion, in part, on another finding   which they say was also reached with high confidence   that the Russians hacked the Republican National Committee s computer systems in addition to their attacks on Democratic organizations, but did not release whatever information they gleaned from the Republican networks.In the months before the election, it was largely documents from Democratic Party systems that were leaked to the public. Intelligence agencies have concluded that the Russians gave the Democrats  documents to WikiLeaks.Republicans have a different explanation for why no documents from their networks were ever released. Over the past several months, officials from the Republican committee have consistently said that their networks were not compromised, asserting that only the accounts of individual Republicans were attacked. On Friday, a senior committee official said he had no comment.Donald Trump has said the CIA s conclusion that Russia interfered in the presidential election is  ridiculous  and being used by Democrats as  just another excuse  for his defeat of Hillary Clinton.The president-elect told Fox News Sunday that he did not necessarily oppose Barack Obama s order for a review of campaign-season cyber-attacks.But he added that in any such effort,  you should not just say  Russia . You should say other countries also, and maybe other individuals.   Guardian",left-news,"Dec 11, 2016"
2804, Malala Yousafzai’s Message To Trump Is Something EVERYONE Needs To Listen To,"With Donald Trump writing Executive Orders that ban Muslims from several countries, including refugees from war torn countries, it s left many wondering if Trump even has a soul.There are literally families dying, children dying, communities ravaged, and Trump has the audacity to turn his cold shoulder to all of them. It s not only cruel, it s brutally un-American and stands against everything we ve ever been as a nation.The Statue of Liberty still stands, and the message of refuge cannot be lost.With one of the most honest and poignant messages yet, Malala Yousafzai wrote a statement regarding Trump and his orders. Everyone needs to listen to it and take it to heart, most especially Donald Trump.Here is Malala s statement regarding Trump s executive orders: I am heartbroken that today President Trump is closing the door on children, mothers and fathers fleeing violence and war. I am heartbroken that America is turning its back on a proud history of welcoming refugees and immigrants   the people who helped build your country, ready to work hard in exchange for a fair chance at a new life.I am heartbroken that Syrian refugee children, who have suffered through six years of war by no fault of their own, are singled-out for discrimination.I am heartbroken for girls like my friend Zaynab, who fled wars in three countries   Somalia, Yemen and Egypt   before she was even 17. Two years ago she received a visa to come to the United States. She learned English, graduated high school and is now in college studying to be a human rights lawyer.Zaynab was separated from her little sister when she fled unrest in Egypt. Today her hope of being reunited with her precious sister dims.In this time of uncertainty and unrest around the world, I ask President Trump not to turn his back on the world s most defenseless children and families.

5562, FBI Director Just Smacked The Smug Look Off Trey Gowdy’s Face And Left Him Speechless (VIDEO),"Professional Clinton witch hunter Trey Gowdy probably expected the public grilling of FBI Director James Comey to go a lot better than it did. On Thursday, unsatisfied with the lack of prosecution of a certain person whose name rhymes with  Schmillary Schminton, Republicans decided to investigate the investigators. For hours, Comey maintained a superhuman level of cool as he answered every ridiculous question Gowdy and pals threw at him as they struggled to find something   anything   they could use to rake the former Secretary of state over the coals.While discussing intent to commit a crime, Gowdy explained to Comey that the FBI director was a  white collar prosecutor  while he was a  gutter prosecutor    something that appears to be a dog-whistle term for  black people    and that the people Gowdy prosecuted were too stupid to know that murder is wrong.Gowdy told Comey that he is  reading a specific-intent element into a gross negligence statute  regarding Clinton s supposed willful lawbreaking   and that s when Comey dropped the hammer: The question you gotta ask is why is it that the Department of Justice since 1917 has not used that gross negligence statute but charging it once in an espionage case. Whether their decision was smart or not, that is the record of fairness. So you have to decide, so I treat this person against that record, and if I do is that a fair thing to do? Even if you re not worried about the constitutionality of it, my judgment is no reasonable prosecutor would do that.

21746,WHY WAS THIS YOUNG MAN SPONSORED BY CAIR INVITED TO THE WHITE HOUSE,"It s Hard To Know Who Obama Hates More America, Israel Or Our Police Officers Barry doesn t have time to attend the funerals of any of the cops who ve been murdered in his race war, but he s got time to meet with a CAIR sponsored victim of alleged police brutality following a violent protest, supposedly at the hands of Israel police officers. He s always got time for the  victim,  especially if the radical muslim organization, CAIR has anything to do with using the victim s status to promote their radical cause. A White House official confirmed that the Obama administration s national security team recently met with a teenager who garnered international headlines after a video of him being beaten by Israeli police during a protest in East Jerusalem emerged on the Internet.Tariq Khdeir, a fifteen-year-old Tampa resident of Palestinian decent, was hosted at the White House for continuing meetings with the Obama administration, which says that it is continuing to monitor the case.Khdeir was filmed being beaten and arrested by Israeli police last summer during a riot in a Palestinian neighborhood over the death of Muhammad Abu Khdeir, Tariq s cousin.A White House official confirmed late Monday to the Washington Free Beacon that Khdeir and his family were hosted at the White House for meetings. The confirmation came following initial reports of the April 15 meeting by CNN. The U.S. government has remained closely engaged with Tariq and his family since his return from Jerusalem,  a White House official told the Free Beacon.  As part of the follow-up on pending issues related to his case, National Security Council staff met with the Abu Khdeir family recently. While Tariq Khdeir was originally accused of participating in the riot which came amid a series of similar riots in Jerusalem last summer he was cleared of all charges in January.Khdeir s cousin Muhammad was the victim of an apparent revenge killing in the wake of the abduction and slaughter of three Israeli teens by Palestinian terrorists.Anti-Israel activists touted the video of Khdeir s beating as proof of widespread Israeli aggression and malfeasance in East Jerusalem. Organizations such as the Council of America-Islamic Relations (CAIR) have featured Khdeir as a speaker at various anti-Israel conferences.The family is reportedly seeking assurances that Khdeir will not be subjected to retaliation by Israel should he return to Jerusalem.The Obama administration is reportedly miffed with Israel over the incident and believes the government has not taken such incidents seriously, according to CNN. Based on numerous conversations with administration officials on background, there is a widespread belief within the Obama administration that the Israeli government does not take these incidents against American citizens with the seriousness U.S. officials believe they merit,  CNN reported. Unless there is video evidence that excessive force was used, as in the case of Tariq Khdeir, Israeli government officials inevitably conclude that the action taken was justified and in keeping with national security needs, officials say,  according to the report.Via: Washington Free Beacon",left-news,"May 12, 2015"
22640,"Iraq Redux: US-led Sanctions Against Syria Are Hurting Real People, Helping Real Terrorists","Eva Bartlett RT OpEdgeThis month, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation interviewed Dr. Bouthaina Shaaban, Political and Media Advisor to Syria s President. The methods used to undermine Shaaban s message should come as no surprise.The interview was typical of the infrequent times corporate media has bothered to interview Dr. Shaaban: loaded lexicon, pre-priming the audience with false allegations about the Syrian government, repeatedly cutting-off the high-ranking guest, and a notably rude and condescending demeanor not afforded to guests who tow the NATO narrative on Syria.As with other top Syrian representatives, Shaaban is made out to be  non-credible  by corporate media pundits when they deign to interview her. They actively work to discredit Syrian officials while at the same time putting forth claims that Wahhabi terrorists are  rebels  and  Syrian representatives  and those warring on Syria are  concerned  about widespread suffering in the country. Zein Abudllah, 8, injured by shrapnel to his face in the December 12, 2015, triple terrorist bombing in al-Zahra a, Homs.   Eva BartlettSanctions: It is the Syrian People Who Are SufferingDr. Shaaban emphasized the Syrian realities at a meeting in her office in December.A crucially-important issue that media pundits ignore is that of the crippling sanctions on Syria. In terms of how to provide actual relief to the Syrian people, Dr. Shaaban stated: The first thing the West should do in this battle against terrorism is to lift the sanctions from the Syrian people. The sanctions are helping terrorists against the Syrian people, who are suffering doubly from the terrorists and from Western measures against the Syrian people. Stephen Gowans recently wrote about the US government s long-time plans to topple the Syrian government, sanctions being one part of the plot. Documents prepared by US Congress researchers as early as 2005 revealed that the US government was actively weighing regime change in Syria.  As an alternative to direct military intervention to topple the Syrian government, the United States chose to pressure Damascus through sanctions and support for the internal Syrian opposition. The advocacy website, End The Sanctions on Syria, notes:  Similar sanctions on Iraq in the 1990s were shown to have caused the deaths of more than half a million Iraqi children. The site went on to report that (as of May 2014),  701 of 1,921 Syrian health centres have been  completely gutted  by the terrorist attacks. Yet rehabilitation of these centres is retarded by the US-EU sanctions, which have already left  a deep mark on the healthcare system  including by blocking access to medicines, medical equipment, transport and communications. A May 27, 2015 article in The Lancet reports: The cost of basic food items has risen six-fold since 2010, although it varies regionally. With the exception of drugs for cancer and diabetes, Syria was 95 percent self-sufficient in terms of drug production before the war. This has virtually collapsed as have many hospitals and primary health-care centres.Economic sanctions have not removed the President:  only civilians are in the line of fire, attested to by the dire state of household and macro-economies. Sanctions are among the biggest causes of suffering for the people of Syria. Journalist who returned from #ISIS HQ tells RT how jihadists can be defeated https://t.co/EO1nr5UOGA pic.twitter.com/xq7Q2mgeKE  RT (@RT_com) November 22, 2015Western ContradictionsFrom 2011 to May 2014, Russia (as well as China) has used its veto four times against unjust UN Security Council draft Resolutions against Syria. In September 2015, upon request of the Syrian government, Russian fighter planes entered Syrian airspace, from the start doing what the US-led coalition had purported it would do: targeting terrorist hotbeds in Syria.Although continually vilified in Western media, Russia s requested and welcomed intervention in Syria complements their consistent anti-Western-intervention stance.In contrast, in the year and a half that the US-led coalition has been illegally violating Syrian skies, they ve done little to stop terrorists  movements and have repeatedly  accidentally dropped supplies to terrorist factions, while terrorists transit through hundreds of miles of open desert, thereby prolonging the otherwise-real fight against terrorism being waged by the Syrian army and allies.On Western diplomacy, Dr. Shaaban remarked: The contradictory statements coming from the West are puzzling, to say the least. Even when he (US Secretary of State John Kerry) said we are not seeking regime change, the US ambassador at the UN (Samantha Powers) said President Assad had to go. Then, Kerry gave a statement in the Security Council that he agreed with Russia that it is up to the Syrian people to decide their destiny and their government. Then President Obama comes and says, no, President Assad has to go. Indeed, aside from being immoral and criminal, the various statements and actions of Western leaders are borderline-schizophrenic.Obama has flip-flopped on his  Assad must go  position, his latest declaration alleging peace will not come  until Assad is out of power .Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter and Vice President Joe Biden have both flexed military muscles, saying America is ready to take  direct action on the ground  in Syria and ready for a military solution  in Syria.In contrast, on February 9, 2016, State Department Spokesperson, John Kirby, pledged: There s not going to be a military solution to this conflict.   It has to be solved politically. And more importantly, it has to be solved by Syrians. Kerry, in his most absurd Kerry-ism yet, is reiterating the  must go  line and waffling on about a  Plan B  and a  partition  of Syria.  Here is the difference between them and Russia. If you take the statements of Putin or Lavrov from the beginning of the crisis until now, you find them consistent, in line with each other. You find them coming from a stand against terrorism, that countries have sovereignties, and that it is the people of these countries who should decide the future of the country, with no foreign intervention. All of their stands are in line with international legitimacy and with UN resolutions.That s why the stand of the Russians, for us, is a noble stand. As Putin said, they are defending the national security of Russia and Syria, which is true. Turkey: Warring on Syria There s no dialogue between us and Turkey, none at all. Turkey continues to support terrorism in Syria. If you imagine a Syria without an 800 km border with Turkey, these terrorists could not have come to Syria. Turkey is an accomplice in this war on Syria.In Iraq, Turkey withdrew, because President Obama called Erdogan to withdraw from Iraq. This also shows that when the United States wants them to stop, they stop,  Shaaban said.A recent article on Consortium News emphasized precisely this point: The U.S. traditionally has held tremendous power over client states like Turkey and Saudi Arabia. So, an order from Washington is usually enough to get such governments to back down. Referencing Turkey s recent shelling of Azaz in Aleppo, it noted: Turkey s attacks also are aimed at preventing the Syrian government from sealing the Turkish border where the Islamic State and other jihadist groups have smuggled across fighters, weapons and other supplies into Syria   as well as oil from Syria into Turkey. According to Dr. Shaaban,  Western countries keep silent about Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, because these are the three countries which are financing, arming and facilitating terrorism into our country.  Syrian Ambassador to the United Nations, Dr. Bashar al-Ja afari (image from Syrianews.cc) Our people are the victims of this terrorism On December 13, the day I arrived in Syria, terrorists rained more mortars than usual on Damascus. I asked Dr. Shaaban the pointedly rhetorical question of whether Western leaders condemned this or other terrorist acts in Syria. Nobody speaks about mortars hitting our cities, our civilians. These missiles are hitting our schools, our hospitals, and people on the street. They are not targeting the army.Many countries have the technology which could detect these mortars and save the lives of civilians. But with the sanctions being imposed on Syria, nobody will give us this technology. She cited the December 17, 2015 passing of UNSC Resolution #2253, on halting the financing and support of terrorism, emphasizing,  There are so many resolutions before that: 2170, 2178, 2199. The latest, a 28-page resolution,  covers asset freeze, travel ban, arms embargo and listing criteria for ISIL, Al-Qaida and associated individuals, groups, undertaking and entities,  the UN s press release noted. However, given that the US itself continues to arm terrorists, it is likely this last resolution will not have the desired effect of truly stopping terrorism in Syria. Our people are the victims of this terrorism. Syria is a secular country, so many ethnicities and religions have lived peacefully together for thousands of years. Syria is an example of tolerance, of love,  Dr. Shaaban observed, before imploring Western people  to understand that in Syria, mothers, children, fathers, grandchildren  people, like any people in the world, would like to live in peace and security and are suffering from terrorism. Syria refuses to surrenderJust before leaving Syria last December, I was invited to the Joy Choir s Christmas concert. The day prior, President al-Assad and First Lady Asma al-Assad visited the practising choir. Photos and videos of the event evidence the choir s delight at the drop-in. The following evening, the church was so packed that lines of hopeful attendees spilled onto the sidewalk. I mentioned this to Dr. Shaaban. I saw the photos. This is something that you cannot fabricate. You can see from their faces how happy they were,  Shaaban replied. I m very proud of our people. Because President Assad went there the night before, you could expect that some people would be afraid to go, because it might be targeted by the terrorists. Yet the church was crowded. The people were determined to be there, whether it got targeted or not. The Notre Dame de Damas Church is indeed in close proximity to the terrorist-occupied area of Jobar, which regularly fire mortars, hell-cannons, and rockets on Damascus. This is the merit of the Syrian people. They do not fear death. The world wants to destroy us, and the Syrian people are saying  no  in every kind of way. When there is a terrorist missile, for example on Bab Touma, immediately after, people are out on the streets. We refuse to die. We refuse to surrender,  Shaaban emphasized.Indeed, on my December visit to various parts of Homs, including the Old City, there was evidence of the pulse of life: new shops and stalls opened; homes and restaurants rehabilitated.A more recent example of this resilience involves the terror-bombed and ravaged neighborhood of al-Zahra a in Homs, which I also visited in December. Tragically, it has been hit by terrorists  car and suicide bombings three more times since the December 12th triple-blast bombings.

1832," While Her Department Gets Gutted, Billionaire Betsy DeVos DEMANDS Extra Expensive Security","Donald Trump and his administration seem to be all about austerity, as long as it s the nation suffering and not his family or employees. Trump s education secretary, Betsy DeVos isn t suffering. In fact, she s the only cabinet member that requires security from not jut the Secret Service, but from US marshals, and it s costing the schools she oversees a lot of money.No one is telling us why DeVos needs the extra security, but the Marshalls are sending a bill to the Education Department in the amount of $8 million to cover about eight months. While that s a drop in the bucket for a department whose budget is about $70 billion, that money is coming straight from the nation s children s educations.The new outlay is a tiny fraction of the department s budget, but comes as the Trump administration has proposed slashing the spending plan by $9 billion, or 13.5 percent.DeVos is the only Cabinet secretary under the protection of the marshals, law enforcement officers who are generally responsible for protecting federal judges, transporting prisoners, apprehending fugitives and protecting witnesses. They also guard the deputy attorney general and Supreme Court justices when they travel.Source: Washington PostDeVos s security team changed from Secret Service to the Marshalls after some protesters blocked her entry into a school shortly after her confirmation. The protest was completely non-violent. Other than that, we have no clue why the apparent overreaction.Note that DeVos is rich, very rich, even richer than her boss. She and her family are worth about $5.1 billion. If we can find a single rationale for putting the super rich in the higher eschelons of government, it should be that they could fray some of they cost, right?It seems, though, as if the super rich in government are now just taking their money making skills and using them to bilk the American taxpayers. Trump is making the taxpayers pay for a vacation a week and, now, DeVos s security is coming   literally   from the mouths and brains of children.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images.

7163, This One Car Could Overthrow The Governments Of America’s Enemies Better Than Any War Could (VIDEO),"For more than a century, countries around the world who found themselves rich in crude oil have held industrialized nations dependent on it hostage. Since the first Ford factory pushed out a production automobile, forever changing the way we travel, those countries with the means to fuel the internal combustion engine have prospered.The United States has prided itself on being peacemakers since World War II, but all too often we are held captive by what would otherwise be third world nations, often ruled by religious zealots and ruthless dictators. The first Gulf War was the perfect example. Kuwait, a long-standing ally and major supplier of oil to the U.S., was toppled within days by Saddam Hussein, who wanted control of their port and their oil. The United States had no choice but to step in, calling it a humanitarian mission and sending Hussein back to Baghdad, but stopping short of toppling his regime once the oil was secured. Suddenly, it became far more important to put out oil field fires than it was to remove a ruthless murderer from power.Our government and our allies have to protect the interests of their people. In doing so we are stuck dealing with people like the Saudis, who have a Royal Family with good intentions but are ultimately ruled by fundamentalist clerics at the local level. Human rights violations far exceed what we would consider acceptable if they weren t such a large supplier of oil to NATO countries. There are examples of the same kinds of abuses from all over the oil-rich world, but the black gold tends to keep anyone from being held accountable.So how could we make it possible to rid the world of tyranny and oppression bought and paid for with crude oil? By eliminating it from the equation. Elon Musk and Tesla have just announced that we are one giant leap closer to that goal with the rollout of the model 3 , a production model fully electric car that will be available by the end of 2107 for a starting price of $35,000. With the power to go from zero to 60 in six seconds and more than 200 miles on a single charge, the Tesla model 3 could realistically change the world.Once an idea becomes a reality, the next step is to make it affordable. While $35K may seem out of reach for many, it s certainly right in line with the $33,500 average selling price of a new car in America. From there the technology should migrate to other modes of transportation. The world is a changing place, and this major step in our socioeconomic evolution is a milestone we should all be ecstatic to see.https://www.facebook.com/cnn/videos/10154647071941509/ Featured image from Jordan Pix/Getty Images",News,"April 1, 2016"

If you re traveling during this very American holiday, please keep your eyes and ears open. See something SAY SOMETHING!WAIT WHAT? I THOUGHT OBAMA SAID ISIS IS JUST A JV TEAM!Federal authorities have warned local law enforcement officials across the country about a heightened concern involving possible terror attacks targeting the July 4th holiday, a U.S. law enforcement official said.While there was no specific or credible threat of attack, the official said the intelligence bulletin prepared by the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI alerted local colleagues to the ongoing threats posed by the Islamic State and other homegrown extremists. The official was not authorized to comment publicly.The bulletins are frequently issued in advance of major U.S. holidays out of an abundance of caution and concern that operatives may exploit the timing to generate greater attention.The warning comes as federal investigators have worked to disrupt a number of Islamic State-inspired plots, including a planned assault earlier this month on police officers in Boston. In that case, authorities fatally shot Usaamah Rahim as he allegedly planned to attack police with military-style knives.Also this month, a New York suspect in a Islamic State-related terror investigation was arrested after attacking an FBI agent with a kitchen knife during a search of his home.Fareed Mumuni, 21, was charged with attempted murder, after he emerged as a suspect in alleged plots to use pressure-cooker explosives and knives to attack police.In a statement Friday following attacks in Tunisia, France and Kuwait, DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson said local law enforcement was being encouraged to be  vigilant and prepared  in preparation for July 4th celebrations. We will also adjust security measures, seen and unseen, as necessary to protect the American people,  Johnson said.  We continue to encourage all Americans to attend public events and celebrate this country during this summer season, but always remain vigilant. Via: USA Today",Government News,"Jun 28, 2015"

Let s hope Trump fires Mueller ASAP this is a witch hunt that needs to end The 12 counts are for  money laundering and not registering as a foreign agent when Manafort worked for pro-Russian forces in the Ukraine BEFORE they worked for the Trump campaign.Manafort was seen leaving his home this morning and then entering the FBI building with his lawyer:Former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort told to turn himself in today: Report https://t.co/Upf5gTqiQp pic.twitter.com/4cx3TFTgVV  Fox News (@FoxNews) October 30, 2017Manafort entering the FBI offices with his lawyer:Ex-Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort walks into FBI office; surrendering to feds in connection to Russia probe https://t.co/B2d9RX5PsV pic.twitter.com/piMhgnKNOY  ABC News (@ABC) October 30, 2017FOX NEWS IS REPORTING: Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his associate Rick Gates were reportedly told to surrender to federal authorities as part of the special counsel s investigation into Russian meddling and potential collusion with Trump campaign officials during the 2016 presidential election.JEFFREY TOOBIN: Trump campaign not mentioned in Manafort indictmentAccording to the New York Times, Manafort and Gates will face the first charges in the special counsel s investigation, though the charges are not immediately clear.Gates is a longtime associate of Manafort. According to the Times, his name appeared on documents linked to companies that Manafort s firm created in Cyprus to receive payments from politicians and businesspeople in Eastern Europe.Mr. Manafort had been under investigation for violations of federal tax law, money laundering and whether he appropriately disclosed his foreign lobbying. Mr. Manafort has expected charges since this summer, when F.B.I. agents raided his home and prosecutors warned him that they planned to indict him. That warning raised speculation that Mr. Manafort might try to cut a deal to avoid prosecution.Mr. Trump s lawyer, Ty Cobb, said there were no concerns that Mr. Manafort would offer damaging information about the president in exchange for a deal.Some close to Mr. Manafort, including his former business partner Roger J. Stone Jr., have said he had nothing to offer that would help prosecutors build a case against Mr. Trump. He s not going to lie,  Mr. Stone said in September.Mr. Manafort, a veteran Republican strategist, joined the Trump campaign in March 2016 to help keep delegates from breaking with Mr. Trump in favor of establishment Republican candidates. Mr. Trump soon promoted him to chairman and chief strategist, a job that gave him control over day-to-day operations of the campaign.But Mr. Trump fired Mr. Manafort just months later, after reports that he received more than $12 million in undisclosed payments from Viktor F. Yanukovych, the former Ukrainian president and a pro-Russia politician. Mr. Manafort spent years as a political consultant for Mr. Yanukovych. ",politics,"Oct 30, 2017"

20701,FLASHBACK: ESPN Female Reporter Still Employed After Being CAUGHT ON VIDEO Berating Garage Attendant…Curt Schilling Fired After Sharing Conservative Views On Facebook,"Leftist Disney owned ESPN has a strange way of determining who is and isn t the type of host they want to be the face of their network.  ESPN just fired baseball great Curt Schilling for sharing an opinion that was contrary to that of leftist Disney owned ESPN when he shared this meme on his personal Facebook page:Schilling added,  A man is a man no matter what they call themselves. I don t care what they are, who they sleep with, men s room was designed for the penis, women s not so much. Now you need laws telling us differently? Pathetic. ESPN then fired Schilling, announcing,  ESPN is an inclusive company. Curt Schilling has been advised that his conduct was unacceptable and his employment with ESPN has been terminated. Asked about the controversy on local radio, Schilling explained,  To be in a place where people actually believe I m a racist or I m transphobic says to me that something has gone horribly askew somewhere. This wasn t the first time Schilling felt the heat from ESPN for his political views. He got slammed for retweeting a graphic that read,  It s said only 5%-10% of Muslims are extremists. In 1940, only 7% of Germans were Nazis. How d that go?  Schilling added,  The math is staggering when you get to true # s.  This was too much for ESPN, which had to step in to defend ISIS, and promptly suspended him from broadcast.Schilling made the horrible mistake of speaking truth in a place where only leftist falsehood is tolerated. ESPN has no problem firing a beloved host for speaking out against radical Islam and the LGBTQ-WXYZ Mafia. ESPN seems to have a soft spot however for female reporters like Britt McHenry (seen in video below) who berate and bully women who she considers to be less fortunate and important than her. Watch here:McHenry was given a one week suspension for her horrific and condescending behavior.ESPN host Stephen A. Smith spoke about former Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice beating his then-girlfriend, and stated,  We also have to make sure that we learn as much as we can about elements of provocation. Not that there s real provocation, but the elements of provocation, you got to make sure that you address them, because we ve got to do is do what we can to try to prevent the situation from happening in any way. And I don t think that s broached enough, is all I m saying. No point of blame.  He was suspended for one week. Schilling suggesting that women be protected from men invading their restrooms, however, was a fireable offense.In the aftermath of the same incident, ESPN host Max Kellerman told a charming story about how when he was dating his now-wife, they were both drunk; she slapped him, and he slapped her back. That carried a short suspension. Kellerman is now back on the air regularly.None of these people committed the ultimate crime: stating that men and women are biologically different and should pee in different places. ESPN, of course, also stumps for more coverage of women s sports, which suggests a question: why not simply open up all women s sports to men, in the name of equality for people of all genders? Or wouldn t that comply with the logically incoherent leftist positional chart?To see more examples of people still working at ESPN who should ve been canned: Daily Wire",left-news,"Apr 21, 2016"

9084,JUST IN: CROOKED DOJ OFFICIAL Didn’t Reveal That His Wife Was Being Paid By Fusion GPS to Get Dirt on Trump [Video],"We ve been covering the curious case of DOJ official Bruce Ohr and his wife Nellie Ohr What they did is so corrupt and underhanded! Nellie worked for the opposition research firm hired by the Democrats to get dirt on Trump (see below). Her husband would take whatever Nellie produced about Trump and hand it over to the FBI! Unreal! This should be jail time because of the omission of the conflict of interest being an ethics violation. So far, it appears as though Bruce Ohr has just been demoted.NOW WE FIND OUT THAT BRUCE OHR HID THE FUSION GPS PAYMENTS TO HIS WIFE:Daily Caller reports:Bruce Ohr, the Department of Justice official who brought opposition research on President Donald Trump to the FBI, did not disclose that Fusion GPS, which performed that research at the Democratic National Committee s behest, was paying his wife, and did not obtain a conflict of interest waiver from his superiors at the Justice Department, documents obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation show.The omission may explain why Ohr was demoted from his post as associate deputy attorney general after the relationship between Fusion GPS and his wife emerged and Fusion founder Glenn Simpson acknowledged meeting with Ohr. Willfully falsifying government ethics forms can carry a penalty of jail time, if convicted.The Democratic National Committee (DNC) hired Fusion GPS to gather and disseminate damning info about Trump, and they in turn paid Nellie Ohr, a former CIA employee with expertise in Russia, for an unknown role related to the  dossier.  Bruce Ohr then brought the information to the FBI, kicking off a probe and a media firestorm.The DOJ used it to obtain a warrant to wiretap a Trump adviser, but didn t disclose to the judge that the DNC and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton s campaign had funded the research and that Ohr had a financial relationship with the firm that performed it   which could be, it turns out, because Ohr doesn t appear to have told his supervisors. Some have suggested that the financial payments motivated Bruce Ohr to actively push the case.OUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON NELLIE OHR:This is a big deal even though we re sure the main stream media will ignore it.

8119, Newt Gingrich Demands President Obama Pick A Conservative Just Like Scalia For SCOTUS (VIDEO),"Newt Gingrich is hoping President Obama will say  yes sir  and do what white conservatives tell him to do.During an appearance on Fox & Friends on Sunday, the former House Speaker and former Republican presidential wannabe chimed in on the death of Justice Antonin Scalia and whether or not President Obama should be able to nominate a replacement during his final year in office.Of course, picking a nominee is the job of the executive branch as laid out clearly by the Constitution. It is then the job of the Senate to hold hearings and then bring up the nominee for a confirmation vote. That s how this works.But Senate Republicans have already vowed to block any and every nominee President Obama puts forward. And Newt Gingrich s solution is even worse than not having a nominee confirmed at all.When Clayton Morris explained that Democrats expect Senate Republicans to do their Constitutional duty because President Obama was elected to a four year term and not just three, Gingrich said that if President Obama wants to guarantee the confirmation of a nominee he should meet with conservative Senators and let them handpick a conservative like Scalia to be the nominee.In other words, conservatives actually think that since Scalia was a conservative that a like-minded individual should be selected to replace him, thus keeping the Supreme Court a conservative-leaning institution.MORRIS:  Senator Leahy and others have said though this would send the [Supreme] Court into disarray, having four-four and leaving these big decisions to the appellate courts and let these decisions stand for a year. And Democrats also saying, look, President Obama was elected to a four-year term. Americans spoke. He was elected to four years, not three years. He has every right to choose a nominee. GINGRICH:  No, no, no. He has every right to recommend. He doesn t have every right to choose. This goes back to the Constitution. The Senate is not obligated to approve who he recommends. I mean, he has a simple model. If he really wants to get somebody approved, sit down with Mitch McConnell and with conservative senators like Mike Lee, ask them who they would approve and nominate somebody who is in the Scalia tradition. Now, Obama is not going to do that. Obama wants to send up a radical to eliminate the Second Amendment right to bear arms, to eliminate religious liberty, to impose bigger government and more power in Washington. And that s his right. I understand that s what he believes. But the Senate has no obligation to shift this court for the next 30 years radically to the left in the last year of the Obama presidency. Here s the video via Media Matters:However, Gingrich s demand is ridiculous. This is not how the system works. While the truth is that no one really knows how a Supreme Court Justice will rule once they start hearing cases and issuing decisions, the fact is that no president is obligated to replace a dead or retiring Justice with one that has the exact ideological views, nor does the Constitution require such a thing.And if Senate Republicans think that s how it should be, they would be committing a sort of political blackmail to get their own way. The bottom line is that the president picks nominees to the Court and it s the Senate s job to confirm them or not. We all know that if Ruth Bader Ginsburg ever stepped down from the bench during a Republican presidency that she would be replaced immediately with a staunch conservative. Republicans certainly would never entertain the thought of replacing her with an ideological copy in the name of  fairness.  So conservatives like Gingrich should not expect Scalia s replacement to be a nominee of their choosing. President Obama will fulfill his constitutional obligation and whether Senate Republicans like the nominee or not, they must do theirs. America deserves a fully functioning Supreme Court.Featured Image: Wikimedia",News,"February 14, 2016"

The average Social Security retirement benefit is $14,772.The report notes that the president s budget, facing congressional approval, includes another $2.1 billion for refugees, which can include the illegals from Central America, mostly Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.What s more, the administration is also spending heavily on a program with the United Nations to help the illegal minors avoid the dangerous trip by declaring them refugees and handing them a plane ticket to the U.S. where, once here, they get special legal status.The report, titled  Welcoming Unaccompanied Alien Children to the United States,  is a deep dive into the administration s evolving efforts to let hundreds of thousands of mostly 16- and 17-year-old males settle in the country.Read more: WT ",politics,"May 2, 2016"
1031, Story Of Severely Disabled Man And His Mom Shows Just How Cruel The GOP ‘Healthcare’ Bill Really Is,"By now, everyone has seen the monstrosity that is the GOP Senate s so-called healthcare bill. At its core, it really is just a huge tax cut for the rich at the expense of the healthcare of poor, elderly, sick, and disabled Americans. We have all watched how disabled members of ADAPT, a decades-old disability rights organization that is largely responsible for the modern day Americans With Disabilities Act, were dragged bodily from their wheelchairs and other medical devices from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell s (R-KY) office, all for exercising their First Amendment rights to protest the inhumane stripping of their life-saving care.We ve been talking about the political price of all of this for years. The GOP is in power, and they are determined to do what they have been wanting to do for the last seven years, which is take the healthcare President Barack Obama gave the nation away. They want to repeal the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. However, what we haven t been talking about is the real effects of all of this on real people.Mike Phillips appeared on MSNBC s The Last Word with Lawrence O Donnell, with Ari Melber sitting in for Lawrence, on Friday night. Mike had a pre-typed statement; you see, he cannot move or speak, but he can move his fingers long enough to communicate via a computer. It takes a very long time, though, and thus his statement was pre-written. His mother, Karen, takes care of him full time. He also has a personal caregiver. Many of these services are provided through Medicaid, which the cruel GOP massive tax cut for rich people healthcare bill cuts.If this bill becomes law, Mike and those like him and others living with all kinds of disabilities will be relegated to substandard nursing homes or institutions. Mike s mother explained that there is no facility in Florida, where they live, that is equipped to deal with Mike s needs. Therefore, not only would Mike be ripped from his home and loved ones, he d have to be shipped away to some institution for people with severe disabilities in another state, where his family would either have to relocate, or he d be surrounded by strangers, completely helpless and unable to speak out if he is being neglected or mistreated.One might ask the same question, Karen, Mike s mother asks in the video you are about to watch   how could this country treat its citizens this way? How could they harm and drag people from wheelchairs for standing up for their rights? How can they take healthcare from the most vulnerable among us?I ll tell you how. It s because Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell exist and they are in charge, that s how. Paul Ryan admitted that he has been dreaming of ripping Medicaid to shreds since he was at college keggers, despite the fact that he used Social Security to get through college after his father died. He might have a pathological hatred of social programs now, but he wouldn t be where he is today without them. Mitch McConnell had polio as a child and grew up dirt poor. While he didn t get government care, he still recovered due to the kindness of strangers at a facility built by Franklin Delano Roosevelt. In other words, without help, McConnell would be poor, disabled, and likely in some kind of facility. However, thanks to this outside help. he somehow  made it,  and has spent his entire career outrunning his past as a poor kid with a disability. He s still running, as his number one mission in life is to deny the type of kind, compassionate care he received in his hour of need to those in similar situations today. These two men don t care who they hurt along the way   they just want to prove that who they are now has nothing to do with how they grew up.In other words, the two most powerful men in America are also the most dangerous to the most vulnerable Americans. They are out to prove that folks who didn t or couldn t  pull themselves up by their bootstraps,  or those who they believe are not properly contributing don t deserve to live and eat like the rest of us.Think the GOP isn t heartless?

1432, The Hilarious Way WH Staff Secretly Signaled They Have No Idea Why Ivanka Is Allowed In Meetings,"When news broke that Ivanka Trump would be getting her very own office in the West Wing many assumed she would receive some sort of job to go along with it. Instead, she has been just sort of hanging out, floating to different meetings sporadically. If she wants to, say, meet the Japanese Prime Minister whose government is critical to greenlighting Trump business interests, she ll show up. If she wants to drop in on a closed-door meeting with business leaders to discuss policy, she ll do that too.

20561,"PUTIN Threatens To Release 20,000 “Top Secret” Emails From Hillary…Why Judge Napolitano Says This Is Very Bad News For Hillary [VIDEO]","Putin may be the one person Obama has absolutely no influence over. With Obama unable to use his Chicago thug-like political tactics on Putin, could this finally be the end of Hillary Clinton s career in politics? Hillary Clinton sits at the center of a raging firestorm concerning her arrangement of a private email account and server set up in her home   from which top secret information may have been deleted. But despite Bernie Sanders  apparent annoyance with the  damn emails,  the scandal just exponentially intensified, when Judge Andrew Napolitano revealed on Monday that Russia has possession of around 20,000 of Clinton s emails   leaving open the possibility her deletions might not have been permanent after all. There s a debate going on in the Kremlin between the Foreign Ministry and the Intelligence Services about whether they should release the 20,000 of Mrs. Clinton s emails that they have hacked into,  Napolitano told Fox News  Megyn Kelly in an interview for The Kelly File.https://youtu.be/oounggTI-jkWith Clinton s repeated claims she employed the personal email server only for mundane communications and non-sensitive State matters having been proven outright lies, the deletions of 31,830 emails   in the new context of Napolitano s statement   have suddenly become remarkably relevant.As the FBI investigation of Hillary Clinton s questionable email practices deepens, the question of who had access to what information previously located on the former secretary of state s server is now more critical than ever.One such individual, Romanian hacker Guccifer, who was abruptly extradited to the United States, revealed he had easily and repeatedly accessed Clinton s personal server   and he wasn t the only one. For me, it was easy,  the hacker, whose given name is Marcel Lehel Lazar, exclusively told Fox News;  easy for me, for everybody. If Guccifer and Napolitano are right, Russia may, indeed, have possession of highly-sensitive information courtesy of Clinton s arrogant failure to adhere to the obligation to use a government email account during her tenure as secretary   a situation worsened by the now-mendacious claim no sensitive information had been sent through the personal account.In fact, if Guccifer is to be believed   as his extradition by the U.S. indicates   news of the Kremlin having obtained potentially top-secret material may be the tip of a gargantuan iceberg. Using a readily available program, the Romanian hacker also claimed he observed  up to 10, like, IPs from other parts of the world  during sessions on Clinton s personal server. If just one of those unknown parties was connected to Russia, who the other nine might be could be central to the FBI s decision whether or not to charge Clinton for mishandling classified information.Adding yet another nail in the coffin case against Hillary on Thursday, the Hill reported conservative watchdog Judicial Watch revealed, pursuant to a Freedom of Information Act request, frustration with technical difficulties in obtaining a secure phone line led the secretary to direct a top aide to abandon the effort and call her without the necessary security in place.

78, Trump’s National Security Adviser Reportedly TRASHED Him – This Is Epic,"Add Trump s national security adviser, General H.R. McMaster, to the growing list of high-profile people who think he s a total buffoon. McMaster, a seasoned combat officer in the Army, is reportedly fed up with Trump s lack of intelligence, lack of focus, and inability to understand even the most basic premises of national security.According to several Buzzfeed sources, McMaster was attending a private dinner with Oracle CEO Safra Catz, and dragged Trump through the mud, calling him an  idiot,  a  dope,  and someone with the intelligence of  a kindergartner.  Another source who wasn t at the dinner told Buzzfeed that McMaster has made similar comments before.Recently, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson reportedly called Trump a moron, prompting the man-baby to jump on Twitter and challenge Tillerson to an IQ test. Trump either knows exactly what he is and is riddled with self-loathing and embarrassment over it, or he honestly believes he has one of the great minds and memories of all time, just like he s claimed, and his fragile fee-fees can t handle anyone thinking otherwise.Then there s Senator Bob Corker, who s had no qualms at all about criticizing Trump, which led the two of them into a Twitter war because Trump can t stand looking like the pathetic, ineffective pseudo-man that he is. And we all know how Senator Jeff Flake feels.Officials who are on Trump s side, however, push back against all these things vehemently. From their stories, everything is hunky-dory in the White House, and Trump is highly competent, calm, collected, respected   in short, presidential. Anyone inside or outside the White House talking badly about him is just, well, jealous ? Or un-American ? To them, these stories are nothing more than people deliberately working to undermine Trump, at least in the world Trump and his loyalists are desperate to create.These stories keep coming out, though, and when taken with his embarrassing public appearances and his ridiculous behavior on Twitter, they are ever harder to ignore. Buzzfeed has five sources for McMaster s words, with a sixth saying they d heard similar words from him before.This dinner between McMaster and Catz took place over the summer, and was allegedly peppered with insults toward Trump and other senior members of the White House staff, including Trump s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. McMaster reportedly (and, if true, correctly) said that Kushner doesn t belong in the White House and shouldn t be involved in national security matters.In short, Trump doesn t have the respect he thinks he has.

1193," Kellyanne Conway Just Earned ‘Leaker’ Label, And She May Have Thrown Trump To The Wolves (TWEETS)","The entire Trump White House is all about cracking down on leaks that make them look bad, but perhaps Kellyanne Conway didn t get that memo. At a party on Friday night, Politico reports that she was overheard making a series of less-than-savory comments about a few things to reporters, including something Trump told her about James Comey and whether tapes of his conversations in the White House exist. Someone at the party overheard and created a Twitter account to document the exchanges.The account is called @KellyanneLeaks, and the conversations took place at the British Embassy during their election night party. One of the things she said, according to @KellyanneLeaks, was this:She said Trump told her to say  Jim Comey will have to wait and see about the tapes ; she added  I chose to convert that to  no comment'  3/  Kellyanne Leaks (@KellyanneLeaks) June 9, 2017It sounds like Trump was trying to get her to intimidate Comey on his behalf, because apparently he hasn t already tried that enough already.  I chose to convert that to  no comment,  refers to her actual statement that she could not comment on the tapes, and that Trump wouldn t comment any further, either.The White House was not exactly pleased about what Comey said to the Senate on Thursday, and Trump himself wasted little time in calling Comey a liar while also saying his testimony was vindicating. His lawyer has sent a complaint to the Department of Justice over Comey s  leaked  memo, which just makes their whole position worse. And here s Kellyanne Conway, admittedly speaking to reporters off the record, but still discussing with members of the press something Trump told her that she ultimately refused to say. She and her big mouth may still have gotten Trump in more trouble than he s already in.She also took aim at White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, making fun of the way he talks and what he chooses to be upset about:She had a good/cruel riff mocking @Reince45 in WH staff meetings.

423, Trump Humiliated As DACA Decision Practically Kills His Presidency (DETAILS),"As we saw with his Muslim travel ban as well as his attempt to repeal and replace Obamacare, every time Donald Trump puts forth one of his disastrous ideas, it blows up in his face and delivers a devastating blow to his already failing presidency.Each time Trump introduces an unpopular policy or idea, his already historically low approval rating takes another nosedive. This week, Trump only managed to make things worse for himself when he decided to end former President Obama s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (DACA) program. Here s the problem   most Americans disagree with him.According to a recent survey from Morning Consult/Politico, almost 80% (76% to be exact) of Americans do not believe that Dreamers (the undocumented immigrants that were brought into the United States illegally as kids) should be forced to return to their countries. The majority of Americans are far more humane than Trump, and believe that these immigrants should have the opportunity to become citizens, as most have been productive members and have contributed greatly to American society.Trump is especially in trouble because his decision to end DACA only offers more proof that he is a racist a**hole. As MSNBC s Joy Reid perfectly pointed out, there is  no economic, national security or social cohesion rationale  for ending DACA: Trump might say that he has  great love  for the immigrants that are living in America, but his decision proves the exact opposite. Trump wants to strip Dreamers of the lives and progress they have made for themselves in this country and force them to return to countries they are unfamiliar with, where they will have nothing.With this decision, Trump is not only screwing himself over by killing his presidency, but he is also basically putting the GOP in great danger in future elections by excluding one of the fastest-growing voting demographics. Trump is sinking the Republican Party   and his presidency   at record speed.Featured image via video screen capture ",News,"September 6, 2017"

Had he done that, it would have raised important questions, but the real questions would not have been about the horse. The horse was just a horse. The real questions would have been about the power of the Emperor Caligula and the spine of the Roman Senate. Discussing the merits of the horse would be pointless. Approving this nominee for CEQ would be so preposterous that it would be like appointing Caligula s horse, in that the real question becomes about the power of our fossil fuel emperors and the spine of the Senate,  he said.

11975,OBAMA FINALLY BUILDS BORDER WALL…But There’s One Problem…It’s ONLY For The Obama’s,"President Obama blasted Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump in April, 2016 for his plan to bar immigrants in the U.S. from sending money back home to force Mexico to pay for a new border wall. Oh, no. It s Trump,  a smiling Obama said when he was asked about the 2016 candidate s latest comments.Obama called plan another shortsighted idea from Trump that could spark concern among world leaders.  I am getting questions constantly from foreign leaders about some of the wackier suggestions that are being made,  Obama told reporters at the White House.Obama said Trump s border wall proposal could have  enormous  economic consequences for Mexico, which receives billions of dollars in payments that immigrants in the U.S. send home, and possibly touch off a major spat with an ally. The notion that we are going to track every Western Union bit of money that s being sent to Mexico   good luck with that,  Obama said.Obama s remarks came after The Washington Post published a two-page memo from Trump outlining how he would get Mexico to pay for his wall. Trump s memo outlines how he would cut off certain remittances   cash transfers from people in the United States to Mexico   unless Mexico s government offered $5 billion to $10 billion to pay for the wall.Mexican President Enrique Pe a Nieto has said he won t pay for Trump s wall and claimed the candidate has damaged U.S.-Mexico relations.The country s former president, Vicente Fox, slammed the proposal, saying,  I m not going to pay for that f ing wall. Meanwhile, TMZ reported that workers are busy building a large wall around Obama s new DC residence where he will be moving from the White House, that was coincidentally, also surrounded by a massive wall.Why is it that politicians like Obama and even Republican Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, who has a two-decade-long history of promoting open borders immigration policies, have no problem building a border fence for themselves and their family, even as they denies the American people those same protections.They re quick to criticize Trump and his supporters for wanting to build a wall on our southern border to keep foreign intruders and criminals out for the sake of our national security, yet have no problem erecting large walls around their personal residences to keep their own families safe ",politics,"Jan 7, 2017"
17578,"20 TIME DEPORTED MEXICAN Laughs While Being Sentenced For Sodomy, Kidnapping and Sexual Assault In SANCTUARY STATE of Oregon…Tells Victims’ Relatives: “See All You Guys In Hell!” [VIDEO]","Next time you see a Democrat lawmaker, thank them for supporting sanctuary cities and states, and making every American less safe A Mexican man who was deported from the US 20 times has been convicted of 10 counts including sexual assault in Oregon. On Friday, Sergio Jose Martinez, 31, was sentenced to 35 years in prison in a Portland courtroom after pleading guilty to kidnapping, sexual assault, sodomy and several other counts, KOIN reported.Martinez smiled throughout the trial, and as he left, he gave one grim parting shot to his two victims  relatives:  See all you guys in Hell. The first attack occurred early on the morning of July 24, when Martinez entered the Northeast Portland home of a 65-year-old woman through a window she had left open to cool the house.Wielding a metal rod, Martinez told the woman to get down on the ground, where he bound and blindfolded her, threatened to murder her, and then sexually assaulted her, KGW reported.He stole the woman s purse and car; she called the police from a neighbor s home, and they located the vehicle and put it under surveillance.While they kept an eye on the car, however, Martinez was stalking his second victim in a parking garage on the corner of Northeast 21st Avenue and Northeast Halsey Street.He approached her carrying a knife and made her get into her car; as he got in after her she attempted to escape, but he was able to grab her and start slamming her head into the ground.The woman called out for help and as passersby approached, Martinez attempted to steal her car, then fled on foot when it failed to start. Police caught him minutes later.Two relatives of one of the victims, and one of the victims herself spoke during the sentencing phase Friday, in which Martinez often grinned.A brother of one victim told Martinez:  Sergio, no sentencing is enough. I rather you rot in Hell. Deputy District Attorney Amity Girt, the prosecutor on the case, said:  We had some very powerful victim impact statements that said it all. It was really breathtaking to hear the far-reaching consequences of violent crime, the emotional injury. Under the agreement that spared Martinez a possibly longer sentence if he had been found guilty at trial, he pleaded guilty to 10 counts, including first-degree burglary, sodomy, sex abuse, kidnapping, robbery, and second-degree assault.Martinez s lawyer, Jonathan Sarre, said his client  suffers from some mental illnesses; often such people may do inappropriate things in these situations. However, he acknowledged that a doctor had declared Martinez competent to stand trial.Martinez had been freed from jail in Portland a week before the attacks; he was in there for interfering with police and providing a false birth date.He was released despite a request from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement for the Multnomah County Sheriff s Office to hold him so the agency could take him into custody.Oregon became America s first sanctuary state when it adopted a law in 1987 preventing law enforcement from detaining people who are in the United States illegally but have not broken other laws.

No, no,  Baldwin s Trump told the media when asked about the pee parties.  I m not talking about the pee-pee. It didn t happen. It wasn t as cool as it sounds. Next question.

1850, Images Of Trump Golfing In Florida Leak Despite Him Ordering Press Pool To Stay Inside,"Trump s war on  leakers  who make him look bad by exposing his lies is about to escalate. On Saturday, a CNN reporter managed to snap a few pictures of Trump playing golf for the 15th time as president, despite efforts by his staff to stop it. No doubt, the reporter will face recriminations from the Trump team for doing his job.This is the state our nation has been reduced to: A president so committed to vacations in the face of dismal approval ratings that he locks his press pool up to avoid getting caught doing what he knows looks really, really bad.

Several weeks in a row, Trump claimed he was in serious  meetings  only to later be photographed golfing. In a baffling move that makes one wonder if he wants to be caught, Trump apparently wears the exact same outfit every time he golfs.

He just can t stop golfing. Each time he does, he opens himself up to relentless criticism. It s his 15th vacation in 11 weeks. He s spent $23 million in travel expenses. He s golfing while his own White House implodes. But rather than just, say, skip a weekend of golf, he keeps going back.That s a particularly disturbing pathology in a man who wants us to believe he s an effective president.Featured image via Twitter",News,"April 8, 2017"

8512," Ammon Bundy Arrested, Ryan Bundy And ‘Tarp Man’ Shot After Confrontation With Police (VIDEO)","The ammosexual terrorists currently staging an armed occupation in a federal bird sanctuary in Oregon are standing their ground amid reports that Ammon Bundy and three of their compatriots have been arrested. Monumental imbecile, godawful radio host, and wannabe journalist Pete Santilli s live feed cut out as he stood in front of a hospital near the Malheur Wildlife Refuge to announce that Bundy and others had been arrested, and two had been shot.Santilli says that one of the Faithful received a phone call from the FBI: The word is right now that everyone   and this is the message that they wanted to convey, and if anybody s watching this stream at the refuge   the FBI has conveyed a message: you are free to go, and you must leave now. The confirmation is as follows,  Santilli said.  It is reported that Ammon Bundy is in custody by police. The roads are on lockdown reports of shots being fired and the report that we re getting right now is that two people have been shot.   WRGB reports that one of the militants is dead: Officials said it all began with a traffic stop while Bundy and some of his followers were en route to a community meeting in John Day, about 70 miles away.Shots were fired after FBI agents, Oregon State troopers and other law enforcement agencies made the stop. CNN reports its unclear who fired first.Details of the arrest and confrontation remain unknown, but charges are pending related to the group s 25-day takeover of the wildlife refuge.According to Oregon Live, Ryan Bundy suffered a minor gunshot wound, and Santilli s staff reports that  Tarp Man  Lavoy Finicum, who once warned that he would take death over jail, was also struck by gunfire. The name of the deceased has not been officially released. However, Assemblywoman Michele Fiore says that Finicum is, indeed, dead: If in fact Ammon Bundy has been taken into custody,  he added,  It s not a good thing. Certainly not a good thing.  During the stream, Santilli received a phone call and the stream cut out shortly afterward.  According to Oregon Live, aside from Ammon and Ryan Bundy, the following were arrested:Ryan W. Payne, 32, of Anaconda, Mont., Brian Cavalier, 44, of Bunkerville, Nevada, and Shawna J. Cox, 59, of Kanab, Utah.They have all been charged with conspiracy to impede federal officers, a felony.It is unclear if the remaining domestic terrorists will go home, but it seems unlikely. Many have pledged to fight to the death, with the group begging for clean underwear, tampons, and snacks to survive a long stay at the refuge.  What this means for the occupation remains to be known, but we sincerely hope that Y all Qaeda recognize defeat, give up peacefully, and slink home with their tails between their legs before lives are lost.Watch Santilli report the arrest below:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b-jYxOSnWY&w=560&h=315]The militants back at  base  are backing down, calling for  all patriots  to join them in defending their illegally-occupied land:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RoeNxjaShk]Militant Jon Ritzheimer posted a video of himself saying goodbye to his children.

6673, Trump Gets ROASTED By The White House For Embarrassing Teleprompter Moment (VIDEO),"Up until recently, we ve all been witnessing Donald Trump speak freely with nothing really prepared except for the usual crumpled sheet of paper he d pull out of his coat pocket to read the latest poll numbers to tell us how wonderful he is. However, with clinching the Republican nomination getting closer and closer, he s trying (and failing) to be more refined. Which includes using a teleprompter to read speeches that are prepared for him.During his foreign policy speech on Wednesday, it was painfully awkward to watch. You could hear him reading the speech, which did not come across naturally whatsoever. Watching his head swiftly move from side to side to give the illusion that he was speaking freely was more clumsy than a first date in the dark.Then came the moment when he was trying to be serious and speak about some foreign policy blunders, and he spoke about when some of our embassies overseas were compromised. However, his reading off the teleprompter proved this is probably the first time he has ever heard of the places of which he was speaking.For example, he read: Our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. But SAID: Our embassies in Kenya and Tan-ZANE-ia. Small blunder? Sure, but one that was surely noticed by all and just another example of Trump s clear ineptitude.Donald Trump has a pretty interesting way of pronouncing Tanzania. #tanzaynia https://t.co/2ygcnhCVKF  DOPEITSTOM (@DOPEITSTOM) April 27, 2016Taking notice of this blunder was none other than, well, pretty much everyone- but also White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest.

10218,"WATCH: KELLYANNE CONWAY Gives Dreaded Answer To Liberal Hack, “This Week” Host George Stephanopoulos’ Question About Trump’s Plans To Run In 2020","ABC host George Stephanopoulos sat down with Kellyanne Conway for an interview this morning on  This Week . Stephanopoulos started out the interview by mentioning the new jobs report and the explosion of the stock market under President Trump. He barely took a breath before he jumped directly to a poll that showed despite all of his many accomplishments, that Trump isn t very popular. Kellyanne Conway was quick to point out, that although Trump s poll numbers aren t as strong as she d like them to be, he s keeping his head down and focusing on his agenda. In other words, President Trump is laser focused on honoring the campaign promises he made to American people who elected him. What a novel idea One can only imagine the disappointment Stephanopoulos must have felt when he got the dreaded answer from Conway to his question about President Trump s plans to run in 2020. After all, who could forget when George Stephanopoulos  wife promised (but of course, didn t follow through) that she would move her family to another country if President Trump won the election?Watch:Conway responded to Stephanopoulos  question about Trump running in 2020:  The president says privately and publicly, often, George that he ll be president for seven and a half more years, so he plans on being a two-term president. Last week, the New York Times article attempted to convince their readers that the Republican Party is divided and fractured and that many of the members of the party were attempting to convince Vice President Mike Pence to run for president in 2020.Pence was furious at the accusation that he was somehow involved in a potential coup against President Trump. So much for the wishful thinking of not very credible and very biased New York Times.And finally, it wouldn t be an interview with the mainstream media if they didn t ask about Trump s phony Russia connection. Kellyanne Conway didn t disappoint with her answer as she blasted Stephanopoulos for pushing the fake narrative:  People just can t get over that election, George.

It s not exactly like Britain is immune from the violent Muslim invasion taking place across Europe. Telling Americans which of our candidates do, or do not represent US values adds a special touch don t you think?Perhaps Queen Clooney should stick to advising Britain citizens about who they should or shouldn t vote for.

In a BBC interview Monday evening, the 38-year-old criticized  the leading candidate on the Republican side  for proposing  building walls  and a temporary pause on Muslim immigration into the United States.She then paraphrased Trump and defended Muslims who she says are  not extremist or violent. If you actually look at what [Trump] specifically says in that now infamous speech about Muslims, he kept saying,  They only want jihad; they don t believe in our way of life; they don t respect our system,  she said.She continued:  And when he says  they  And, you know, you watch the media coverage afterwards and people should ve been saying,  Do you mean the 1.5 billion people around the world who fit that description? Do you mean the people who are U.S. citizens, who are members of your military, the vast majority of whom are not extremist or violent in any way?  Her mother is a Sunni Muslim.Amal Clooney added she is  perplexed  by the success of Trump s campaign. If, at the end of all of this, he gets beaten by the person who becomes the first female president of the United States, then I think that would send a very positive message from the electorate back to him as to what they really think of those points of view,  Clooney said.She concluded:  I don t think they are U.S. values.

6741, Watch Bill Maher Absolutely SHRED Trump For Trying To Clean Up His Image (VIDEO),"Bill Maher LOVES ripping Donald Trump apart, and Friday night s Real Time was no exception. As the media has recently been fawning over the Republican frontrunner s new politically correct persona and celebrating the fact that it has been a few days since Trump has disrespected or offended anyone, Maher took it upon himself to set the record straight.During his show, Maher was joined by his panelists, author Charles Cooke, Leslie Stahl of 60 Minutes, and CNN s Van Jones, to talk about Trump s new public image   a move that Trump s newly hired senior aide, Paul Manafort, was behind. It seems that Trump s campaign has finally caught on to the fact that the candidate s vulgar, brash personality is working against him as the general election approaches, and Manafort has been trying to get the business mogul to tone it down. Since Trump has been playing nice lately, the conservative media hasn t stopped gushing over how  presidential  he is.Remarking on Manafort s comments that Trump has merely been  playing a part  this whole time, Stahl wondered, They re trying to tell the [Republican] party that he s going to change, that they re gonna  fix  his personality  he can t do that. How s he gonna change his personality? Maher was quick to jump in and made a hilarious connection between Trump and dichotomous comedian Andrew Dice Clay, who switches identities whenever he feels like it. Imitating what Trump might sound like, Maher said: He doesn t have to. Sometimes he goes  I m done being Andrew. I m Dice now.  And then Trump puts on the leather jacket:  Hey, hickory dickery dock / a Mexican went up the fucking clock! You can watch Maher s entire takedown below:Manafort s comments about Trump s personality are reminiscent of something Trump endorser and former candidate Ben Carson said about The Donald when he was explaining why he was supporting him.

It s time for the spotlight to be shined on a few of the other actors in the Weinstein movie, including  Justice League  actor Jeremy Irons.Actor Jeremy Irons, who won a  Best Actor  Academy Award for his role in  Reversal of Fortune , is set to play the role of Batman s butler, Alfred J. Pennyworthy in Weinstein s Batman sequel  Justice League . Hollywood has clearly been ignoring sexual predators like Harvey Weinstein, Woody Allen, and Ben Affleck for decades, so it s not too surprising that Jeremy Irons has somehow managed to escape scrutiny by the media, and by his fellow Hollywood actors, after the disgusting remarks he made following his lead role as a pedophile in the controversial  Lolita  movie.In 1998, Jeremy Irons starred as a pedophile in the movie Lolita, that was based on a 1955 novel written by Russian American novelist Vladimir Nabokov. The novel is notable for its controversial subject: the protagonist and unreliable narrator a middle-aged literature professor called Humbert Humbert is obsessed with the 12-year-old Dolores Haze, with whom he becomes sexually involved after he becomes her stepfather.  Lolita  is his private nickname for Dolores.Telegraph   The actor Jeremy Irons, who starred in the film Lolita, says the  hysteria  sweeping the country over pedophilia is damaging relations between adults and children.Irons, who has two sons with his wife Sinead Cusack, says it is important to uphold a rigid social morality but also vital that adults are allowed to show affection to children.Pedophilia should be treated as a disease, he says in a BBC interview to be screened next week. But it must also be recognized that children are attractive and that parental love has a  sexual  element. It is very difficult because children under 16 are immensely attractive,  he says.  Any father will tell you. I think our children have to be protected. But I don t think we need to have hysteria. In the interview, Irons says his character was not a pedophile in the strict sense, as he  knew that what he was doing was wrong . Referring to his family, he describes the difficulties of judging the line between natural affection and pedophilia. I remember when my son was 12 and he was like a god. He just went through that sort of golden time for about 18 months. I don t have a daughter but they do the same. Parental love is sexual. Children practice on their parents. Girls will flirt outrageously with their fathers because they are practicing. But we should know that that is practice. Boys will flirt outrageously with their mothers in a different way. His comments were seized on by child protection charities. The NSPCC said:  Such comments are ambiguous and could be interpreted by sex offenders as a justification for their behavior. Esther Rantzen, the chairman of ChildLine, said:  The words  immensely attractive  are not the best thing to say about children under 16.  Appealing or charming  are more appropriate. Irons, 56, made the remarks when asked about his portrayal of Humbert Humbert, the lecturer who falls for a young girl in the film of Vladimir Nabokov s novel Lolita. When the film came out in 1998, he suggested that child abuse did not always ruin the life of the victim.In the video below, Jeremy Irons arrogantly discusses his own brilliance as he portrays a pedophile in  Lolita . Go to the 7:50 mark to hear Irons tell the interviewers how  devastatingly attractive  many 15-year-old girls are. The greatness of the performance that Dominique Swain gives, is that she is all of our daughters. Funny, wacky, silly, attractive, because many girls of 15 are devastatingly attractive. WATCH:Irons also once posed the question about whether or not a son should be able to marry his father:NYDN -Academy Award-winning actor Jeremy Irons said Wednesday that while he doesn t have much of a strong opinion either way on same-sex marriage, he believes it poses interesting questions, including whether allowing same-sex marriage would open the door for interfamilial relationships. Could a father not marry his son?  Irons asked HuffPost Live host Josh Zepps. Irons argued that  it s not incest between men  because  incest is there to protect us from inbreeding, but men don t breed,  and wondered whether same-sex marriage might allow fathers to pass on their estates to their sons without being taxed.Jason Momoa who plays  Aquaman  in in Weinstein s  Justice League  movie was recently attacked on social media after a video was being circulated of him making a disgusting  joke  during a public forum, where he bragged about the benefit of being able to play  Khal Drogo  on the  Game of Thrones  series, and how he is able to  rape beautiful women and get away with it .   Weinstein s  Justice Leauge  movie,  surfaced on Twitter, where he was seen discussing as far as sci-fi and fantasy, I love that there s so many things you can do like rip someone s tongue out of their throat and get away with it and rape beautiful women. Watch the video below:tw: rapea horrific clip of jason momoa saying he loved working on #gameofthrones bc he ""got to rape beautiful women."" men are trash. pic.twitter.com/K2RBmsWEt6  bella goth (@peeanofreek) October 12, 2017After the video of the Game of Thrones actor went viral, he apologized for his  truly tasteless comment  on Instagram.",left-news,"Oct 17, 2017"
9009, Why The Hell Are Our News Media Whitewashing Domestic Terrorism In Oregon?,"We all rely on the media every day to know what s going on in our world. Many media sources these days have an opinion informing the content they provide, but the majority usually try to avoid outright lying about things. That doesn t seem to be the case in what s happening right now in Oregon.There is an ongoing armed insurrectionist seizure of a federal building happening at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge HQ in Oregon. Depending on what news source you rely on for your  facts , you might be unaware of the reality of the situation.To bring you up to speed: Dwight Hammond, 73, and Steven Hammond, 46, lit fires in an attempt to protect some of their property from invasive plant species. They ended up burning federal land   twice. Their actions netted them an eventual conviction for arson, which they served time for. After they were released, their sentences from a previous judge were found to be illegal   due to them being too short for the minimum sentencing requirements   and they were sent back to jail for longer sentences. The second conviction is what set off the protests, and caused Cliven Bundy s idiot militia to take up arms. To be fair, the Hammonds never asked anybody for help, especially not the Bundys.Here is where this all takes an incredibly weird turn. Many media outlets have been picking up this story, but the major ones are pants-on-fire lying about the event.Below is an excerpt from the Fox News reporting of the situation. Remember, Fox News  article published at 12:00 midnight at the earliest:Some local residents feared the Saturday rally would involve more than speeches, flags and marching. But the only real additions to that list seemed to be songs, flowers and pennies.As marchers reached the courthouse, they tossed hundreds of pennies at the locked door. Their message: civilians were buying back their government. After the march passed, two girls swooped in to scavenge the pennies.A few blocks away, Hammond and his wife Susan greeted marchers, who planted flower bouquets in the snow. They sang some songs, Hammond said a few words, and the protesters marched back to their cars.Dwight Hammond has said he and his son plan to peacefully report to prison Jan. 4 as ordered by the judge.Source: Fox NewsBelow are excerpts from Oregon Live. This is the exact story Fox News credited at the bottom of their article for the information in their reporting. Oregon Live s story was posted with the updates on weapons and threats of violence at 9:15 pm and again at 12:00 am:In phone interviews from inside the occupied building Saturday night, Ammon Bundy and his brother, Ryan Bundy, said they are not looking to hurt anyone. But they would not rule out violence if police tried to remove them, they said. The facility has been the tool to do all the tyranny that has been placed upon the Hammonds,  Ammon Bundy said. We re planning on staying here for years, absolutely,  he added.  This is not a decision we ve made at the last minute. Neither man would say how many people are in the building or whether they are armed. Ryan Bundy said there were no hostages, but the group is demanding that the Hammonds be released and the federal government relinquish control of the Malheur National Forest.He said many would be willing to fight   and die, if necessary   to defend what they see as constitutionally protected rights for states, counties and individuals to manage local lands.Source: Oregonlive.comBelow is a video of Oregon Live s local news coverage   The people walking around in combat gear carrying long rifles seems to be too nuanced for ABC, AP or Fox News to notice:Many people have been calling out Fox for their total bullsh*t coverage on twitter:@FoxNews You misspelled ""Armed Christian terrorists.""

All three news sites credited the local news but chose not to report what the local news actually said, even mischaracterizing it from social media. This was not a journalistic mistake. This was corporate media propaganda.

18691,BREAKING NEWS: GOP Controlled House Votes To REPEAL Obamacare,"After years of debate, the House on Thursday voted to repeal key parts of the Affordable Care Act and replace them with new provisions.The vote, which President Donald Trump was planning to tout as a big victory, sends the Republican-sponsored bill to gut Obamacare to the Senate for consideration.But winning approval for the bill could be even more difficult in the Senate than it has been in the House, where Republican leaders struggled for nearly two months to wrangle enough votes in their caucus to secure its passage.The bill passed by a vote of 217 to 213. All 193 Democrats voting opposed the bill; they were joined by 20 Republicans voting  no. A lot of us have waited seven years to case this vote,  House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said shortly before the voting began.  Many of us are here because we pledged to cast this vote: to repeal and replace Obamacare. This bill delivers the promises we have made to the American people,  Ryan said.House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., told MSNBC shortly before the vote began,  We were elected to do this. After the vote, protesters outside the Capitol building yelled,  Shame, shame!  at members of Congress walking down the front steps.  CNBCWashington Free Beacon   One of the amendments, introduced by Rep. Tom MacArthur (R., N.J.), co-chair of the Tuesday Group, allows states to obtain a waiver from federal standards such as essential health benefits and community rating rules. This measure gained the support of House Freedom Caucus members, who said it will significantly lower health costs, even if it does not fully repeal Obamacare. The MacArthur amendment will grant states the ability to repeal cost driving aspects of Obamacare left in place under the original AHCA,  said the House Freedom Caucus.  While the revised version still does not fully repeal Obamacare, we are prepared to support it to keep our promise to the American people to lower health care costs. Another amendment, introduced by Rep. Fred Upton (R., Mich.) adds $8 billion to the Patient and State Stability Fund, which helps reduce premiums and out-of-pocket costs. This amendment would provide additional funding, $8 billion over five years, to ensure a strong safety net and reduce premiums, or other out-of-pocket costs, for those with preexisting conditions,  said Upton.Following the amendment, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said that the White House supported the measure and that President Trump has been working to ensure that Americans have more affordable care. Overall the efforts that were made, and especially the effort this morning with congressmen Long and Upton, help bring more people into this effort and make it even a stronger bill, and ensure that Americans have a health care system that gets them the care that they need at a price that s affordable,  Spicer said. The president has been on the phone constantly,  Spicer said.  I think we have made this an unbelievable bill and an unbelievable replacement for Obamacare, which is failing, and that s what we ve sought to do from the beginning. ",left-news,"May 4, 2017"
2538, Trump Official ADMITS He Is Collecting ‘Dossiers’ To Blackmail Journalists Into Submission,"Reality TV star Omarosa Manigault has found herself a pretty sweet position in the Trump administration as the director of communications for the Office of Public Liason   but like all of Trump s team, she is learning that the old adage involving loose lips and sinking vessels (like the Trump administration) applies to her current role.With General Flynn s resignation over his suspicious conversation about sanctions with one of Vladimir Putin s lackeys and all the other disasters Trump has caused, whined about, and made worse through his attempts to clean up his mess, the last thing he needs is one of his people revealing that his administration is collecting information they intend to use to blackmail the press but enter Omarosa.American Urban Radio Networks  White House correspondent April Ryan says that last Wendesday Omarosa threatened her outside the West Wing both physically and otherwise:Manigault, who is now a communications official in the Trump administration, got into a heated argument with a White House reporter just steps from the Oval Office last week, according to witnesses. The reporter, April Ryan, said Manigault  physically intimidated  her in a manner that could have warranted intervention by the Secret Service.Ryan also said Manigault made verbal threats, including the assertion that Ryan was among several journalists on whom Trump officials had collected  dossiers  of negative information.Manigault, a onetime friend of Ryan s, declined to address Ryan s accusations on the record, offering only this emailed statement:  My comment: Fake news!  She did not specify what she considered false.As we have learned by now, when the Trump administration cries  fake news,  the allegations are generally true. Despite Manigault s denials, multiple witnesses confirm that the altercation did take place, with one remarking that the Trump official s actions were  Secret Serviceable,  meaning that it was a situation in which law enforcement needs to intervene.This isn t the first time Omarosa has informed the public of the Trump administration s plan to deal with those they view as enemies. In November, Manigault told the Independent Journal Review that  we re keeping a list  of people who have defied Trump. It s so great our enemies are making themselves clear so that when we get in to the White House, we know where we stand,  she said at the time.If a Trump official admitting that the administration is keeping lists of enemies and compiling  dossiers  for blackmail doesn t concern you, then there is something wrong.Featured image via Getty Images",News,"February 14, 2017"

This time, sporting a Che Guevara t-shirt underneath his half-buttoned uniform, Rapone tweeted,  In case there was any lingering doubt, hasta la victoria siempre,  a popular slogan attributed to the late Marxist revolutionary, physician, and guerrilla leader who was ultimately killed and captured by the United States  own CIA.

22443,FALSE PROFITS: The U.S. Military’s War Over Russia,"21st Century Wire says We ve said it many times during the last two years here at 21WIRE and on the SUNDAY WIRE radio show   that the present anti-Russia hysteria being rolled out in the US and Britain is simply a cheap facade to gin up a new arms race.  Not small ticket items, but big ticket items   including the next generation of  next generation tactical nuclear weapons. The only problem is: the out-of-control rhetoric, mixed with Washington s careless and belligerent military posturing  might inadvertently lead to belligerent military action.Watch US Army Chief of Staff Gen. Mark Milley last week, threatening to  destroy any enemy, anytime,  meaning Russia.. General Milley performed his duty for the corporations. All smiles at the AGM. Indeed, business has never been better. Bravo, encore!  says Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon, General Dynamics, BAE Systems, Airbus and General Electric.When will it end? How much profit is enough for the US  defense  industry?The sad truth: it s never enough  Mark Perry PoliticoDuring the Battle of the Wilderness in 1864, a unit of Robert E. Lee s army rolled up some artillery pieces and began shelling the headquarters of Union commander Ulysses S. Grant. When one of his officers pleaded that Grant move, insisting that he knew exactly what Lee was going to do, Grant, normally a taciturn man, lost his temper:  Oh, I am heartily tired of hearing about what Lee is going to do,  he said.  Some of you always seem to think he is going to turn a double somersault, and land in our rear and on both of our flanks at the same time. Go back to your command and try to think what we are going to do ourselves, instead of what Lee is going to do. The story was recalled to me a few weeks ago by a senior Pentagon officer in citing the April 5 testimony of Army leaders before a Senate Armed Services Subcommittee. The panel delivered a grim warning about the future of the U.S. armed forces: Unless the Army budget was increased, allowing both for more men and more materiel, members of the panel said, the United States was in danger of being  outranged and outgunned  in the next war and, in particular, in a confrontation with Russia. Vladimir Putin s military, the panel averred, had outstripped the U.S. in modern weapons capabilities. And the Army s shrinking size meant that  the Army of the future will be too small to secure the nation.  It was a sobering assessment delivered by four of the most respected officers in the Army including Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, his service s leading intellectual. The claim is the prevailing view among senior Army officers, who fear that Army readiness and modernization programs are being weakened by successive cuts to the U.S. defense budget.But not everyone was buying it. This is the  Chicken-Little, sky-is-falling  set in the Army,  the senior Pentagon officer said. These guys want us to believe the Russians are 10 feet tall. There s a simpler explanation: The Army is looking for a purpose, and a bigger chunk of the budget. And the best way to get that is to paint the Russians as being able to land in our rear and on both of our flanks at the same time. What a crock. ( ) The fight over the Army panel s testimony is the latest example of a deepening feud in the military community over how to respond to shrinking budget numbers. At issue is the military s strategic future: Facing cuts, will the Army opt to modernize its weapons  arsenal, or defer modernization in favor of increased numbers of soldiers? On April 5, the Army s top brass made its choice clear: It wants to do both, and Russia s the reason. But a growing chorus of military voices says that demand is both backward and dangerously close-minded that those same senior military officers have not only failed to understand the lessons of Afghanistan and Iraq and embrace service reform, they are inflating foreign threats to win a bigger slice of the defense budget Continue this story at Politico.comREAD MORE RUSSIA NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Russia Files",US_News,"October 18, 2016"

405," New Study Proves That Trump Supporters Are Racist, Infuriated By Black People (IMAGE)","Despite the fact that Donald Trump and his fanbase try to convince everyone that they re not racist whenever they get called out, the verdict is in   and it s exactly as we suspected.Conservatives have been trying to convince everyone that their politics and values are about lowering taxes and minimizing big government, glossing over the fact that most of the time their policies will hurt minorities. Well, there s finally a proven reason for that   it s because, plain and simple, conservatives are racist as hell. And even worse, they have a particular fear of African Americans.In a study reported by Vox, Trump supporters can be set off just by looking at a picture of a black person, and just seeing one can significantly change how they feel about a policy. This was discovered thanks to a new study by political scientists at Colgate and the University of Minnesota, which shed light on some of Trump supporters  most racist behaviors.In the study, conservative participants were asked how they feel about housing assistance. The participants were divided in their support, however, when the researchers threw in a twist, it was discovered that Trump voters were WAY more likely to support housing assistance when they were shown an image of a white person. When they were shown a picture of a black person, it was a completely different story.And it gets worse   not only were the Trump supporters less supportive, but they actually became angry! Just by looking at an African American person, Trump supporters got mad. The authors of this study, which was called Supporters and Opponents of Donald Trump Respond Differently to Racial Cues: An Experimental Analysis,  wrote:We find that white Trump supporters randomly exposed to a black (versus a white) man in the context of soliciting their support for a housing-assistance policy were more opposed to the policy, angrier about the policy, and more likely to blame beneficiaries for their situation.So now we know that no matter how conservatives try to twist their justifications for not supporting certain causes that directly affect black people, the underlying issue is really that they re racist.Featured image via Mark Wallheiser  / Getty Images",News,"September 9, 2017"
1717," Chaffetz’s Decision To Quit Means Big Trouble For Trump, And Here’s Exactly How","Congressman Jason Chaffetz s decision to leave Congress means that bad things really are on the way for President Trump. If his presidency lasts the year, I will be shocked. I will eat a hat if that happens.Chaffetz has been a real star in the GOP. He is known for his ambition. Last November, he won about 74 percent of the vote in his district. He s young. He s good looking. He knows how to get all the right press and do what he needs to do to get ahead. Nothing in his actions in the past would indicate he wanted to leave Washington, DC. At least not yet. Rumors have been going around that he had his eyes on Senator Orrin Hatch s (R-UT) seat or possibly the governor s mansion in Utah. No one expected him to leave Congress so soon after winning reelection by such a large margin.At the same time, the Congressman has not been a true believer in Trump. Last fall, after the now infamous Billy Bush tape was released, he told ABC News,  I don t plan on voting for Donald Trump   this is quite the quandary what the nation s going to have to figure out. I m out, I can t support Trump after his lewd comments.  He went on to talk about his daughters and how he could not defend what Trump said about women. He later went back on that and said that he hated what Trump did but Hillary Clinton was just so much worse.At the start of 2017, things were looking good for the young Utah politician. Chaffetz was still the chairman of the powerful House Committee on Government Oversight and Reform. He had a fellow  Republican  in the White House. His Party had the House, the Senate and the White House. I can imagine him dreaming of all of the legislation he could push through this way.And then it all went wrong. Trump is not a real Republican. He has no real ideology. His only real allegiances are to his own ego and self interest. The things he says and promises he makes are valid only as long as he is voicing them. They then disappear into the proverbial ether. They have no meaning.This wasn t the problem, however. Since Inauguration Day, there have been more complaints and problems with the Trump Administration. Trump s ties to Russia are more than problematic, they could be treasonous. His financial dealings may not meet violations of law, he cannot have conflicts of interest legally. He can have them. He admitted in 2015 that he had a  big conflict of interest with Turkey because I have a hotel in Istanbul.  His frequent trips to Mar-a-Lago mean that the government is paying him every week to stay at his resort. He is still benefitting from all of his businesses and there is no reason to believe foreign leaders car a wit about the Emolument Clause. And these are just a few of the scandals that should be investigated by a committee like the one Chaffetz now heads.This has put Chaffetz in a really tough spot. He has access to information we all do not. If all of what do do know is as bad as it is, one only can wonder what things he has seen. On one hand, he cannot just step down from this committee. He cannot start investigations of a president in his own Party, especially if he knows they will blow it up. He also cannot be a party to Trump s misdeeds.This month, Chaffetz found his exit strategy. Quit Congress. He has done it slowly. First, he announces he will not seek reelection. Next, he hints that he may not serve out his term. His next move will be to quit all together. By August, he will be back in Utah. He has already taken several web domains like www.chaffetz2018.com. He claimed he wanted to be with his wife and children and that was why he was leaving. Keep in mind, his children have lived at home while he has been in Congress. That s ten years away from his kids when they lived at his house in Utah. By the summer, they will all be out of his house. So, this is when he goes back to see them more? Just after they all leave his home? No.Chaffetz sees the writing on the wall and does not want to be taken down by the same scandal that will end the Trump train wreck.Chaffetz isn t alone in this thinking. It was reported earlier this spring that Michael Steele, former chair of the RNC has been telling his clients to  start getting close to Pence. Former chairman of RNC Steele told WWR at lunch that .@RealDonaldTrump will not finish his term; advises clients to bolster ties w/VP Pence  West Wing Reports (@WestWingReport) March 31, 2017Vice President Mike Pence has the same thought. His is a true believer Evangelical Christian. He once voted to take money away from HIV/AIDS funding to give it to  pray away the gay  programs. He does not go to events with women when alcohol is served, unless his wife is there. He has said he is worried he will  be tempted.  He made female staffers leave early so he would not be alone in the office with then. He could not have liked the comments that Trump grabbed women  by the pussy. Chaffetz had a bright future at the beginning of the year and the only way to make that still happen is to get the hell out of Dodge. So that s what he s doing.Featured image via Matt McClain/The Washington Post via Getty Images",News,"April 22, 2017"

His brand is the title sponsor of the truck racing series, while its subsidiary Overton s has sponsored multiple races and cars this season.Amid the flood of CEOs rushing to distance themselves from Trump s business councils after the U.S. president s wishy-washy denunciation of white supremacy last weekend, Lemonis on Wednesday appeared on CNBC s  Power Lunch,  where he seemed to suggest he wouldn t be shattered if people who supported Trump s comments decided to shop elsewhere. Marcus, you have a consumer-facing business, Camping World,  CNBC s Michelle Caruso-Cabrera asked.  So do you worry about, if you were on one of these councils, would you worry, thinking, wow, I ve got to deal with consumers every day, are they going to look at the business poorly because I m associated with the White House?  Lemonis  response:  There s no doubt that there is probably not many consumers in this country today that are in favor of what has been said in the last couple days   and if they are, frankly, don t shop at my business. Lemonis hasn t been shy about criticizing Trump and NASCAR chairman Brian France   who last year endorsed Donald Trump for president, for their past political views. He ripped France for endorsing Trump at a rally during last year s presidential election, and NASCAR was forced to move its postseason truck series banquet from Trump National Doral Miami resort in 2015 after Lemonis threatened not to attend.

1710, Sean Hannity Loses His Sh*t After Getting His Ass Handed To Him By New York Times Writers,"It s time for Sean Hannity to join Bill O Reilly in the unemployment line.On Saturday, the New York Times published an article reporting that Donald Trump gets policy advise from Sean Hannity among many others outside the White House. Sean Hannity tells the president that keeping promises on core Republican issues is crucial Presidents always deploy surrogates to appear on television to spout their talking points, but Mr. Trump has expanded on that by developing relationships with sympathetic media figures like Mr. Hannity who also serve as advisers. Mr. Hannity, the Fox News host, defends Mr. Trump s most controversial behavior in public, but privately, according to people close to Mr. Trump, he urges the president not to get distracted, and advises him to focus on keeping pledges like repealing the Affordable Care Act. Indeed, Hannity served as Trump s chief propagandist during the 2016 campaign and often did interviews with Hannity in order to get the kid gloves treatment.Of course, Hannity had a complete meltdown on Twitter over the article and proceeded to accuse the New York Times of  colluding  with Hillary Clinton and referred to them as  fake news,  which is something Trump would do.@nytimes You colluded with HRC in 2016. It s none of your business who i do or do not talk too. Total fake news speculation about me/@POTUS  Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) April 22, 2017Hannity even accused the Times of spying on his private conversations.@nytimes Any conversation I have with ANYONE is supposed to be PRIVATE. I have NEVER talked to you. Was I surveilled and unmasked by u/NSA?  Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) April 22, 2017That s when several New York Times writers jumped in to defend their publication.Maggie Haberman fired back by informing Hannity that sourced cited him as a person Trump talks to for advise and further informed Hannity that Fox News did not object to the story when the New York Times reached out to the network.W all due respect, we were interested in who POTUS talks to, not you, and several ppl close to him cited you https://t.co/sb9y4nDJYt  Maggie Haberman (@maggieNYT) April 22, 2017Also reached out to Fox News pr, who took no issue w it. And it was hardly critical of you. Not sure why the reax https://t.co/sb9y4nDJYt  Maggie Haberman (@maggieNYT) April 22, 2017Hannity then claimed that he doesn t talk to the New York Times and said that he doubts Trump does either.The @nytimes has no clue who I talk to as I refuse to EVER TALK TO THEM! @POTUS knows you are FAKE NEWS and I doubt he talks to u either.  Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) April 22, 2017But he s wrong. It turns out Trump has done two in-depth interviews with the New York Times in the last month.Then Glenn Thrush chimed in.I was once sitting with a Republican elected official preparing for an interview when he got an email from u giving him political advice https://t.co/lhn4UFQn7I  Glenn Thrush (@GlennThrush) April 22, 2017Apparently, Hannity forgot about that. He also forgot that he has, indeed, spoken with the New York Times and Nick Corasaniti was kind enough to provide a link to the interview.Here s an interview I did with Sean last year: https://t.co/uUMU1yGcoe https://t.co/QzNFgNxSMi  Nick Corasaniti (@NYTnickc) April 22, 2017Yeah, that has to be embarrassing.Anyway, the night passed and Hannity was apparently still pissed off so he imploded on Sunday morning in a series of tweets directed at the trio of writers.Maggie have you ever publicly commented on how @wikileaks revealed the @nytimes colluded with HRC? And then hired @GlennThrush also exposed https://t.co/xPLZpLLzy6  Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) April 23, 2017Maggie, why should people ever accept  several people close to him  as a source, especially when you never contacted me.

6925, Student Haz A Sad After Everyone Mocks Him For His Trump Hat (VIDEO),"Now, typically no one should be mocking a teenager in their place of education, but since it is a place of education, perhaps this can be seen as the child learning something valuable. And while it s never okay to bully, pointing out to someone that they re wearing the hat of a bigoted bully should be mandatory.That being said, one high school sophomore in Portland, Maine, is catching a lot of criticism for wearing his Donald Trump  Make America Great Again  hat, and rightly so.Conner Mullen says that everyone is wearing their  Bernie pins,  so he should be able to wear his Donald Trump hat. However, his fellow classmates are apparently relentless in their taunting, and even a teacher called him out, allegedly saying,  Thank God you can t vote.  When Mullen took his grievance to the assistant principal s office, the solution offered was simply to leave the hat at home.Mullen said: I knew kids would pick on me about it, that s just kids being kids, but when the adults started doing it I thought that s problematic. This is a school that preaches equality. Oh dear. Yes, he actually said that. He just equated himself to the plight for equality because he s being teased for wearing a bigot s hat. The irony is palpable.According to Mullen, the reason he wants Trump to be president is: I want a job  where you can help people, and I ve heard Trump say how important he thinks veterans and (people in law enforcement) are. Oh, dear boy, please, oh please don t believe the pandering nonsense that comes out of Trump s mouth. And as far as his love for veterans, how much he s been supposedly giving veteran groups is highly questionable.Here s the thing, the school isn t telling him he shouldn t wear the hat, but they are suggesting if he d like to stop being relentlessly mocked for such a poor fashion decision, that he should probably just leave the hat at home. Trump is a bigot and probably the worst choice this country could ever have for the role of Commander-in-Chief.The bigger concern here is, what is this student being taught that he believes Trump is a good option? Maybe that should be the real story.Watch the story via WCSH out of Portland, Maine:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"April 13, 2016"

Will FOX News survive if their one-time loyal viewers turn their backs on their two biggest prime-time personalities? Fox News host Bill O Reilly has lost custody of his two teenage children after they reportedly said they would prefer to live with their mother following an alleged domestic violence incident, according to court documents.As reported by Gawker, Mr O Reilly s two children, 13 and 17, will live full time with his ex-wife Maureen McPhilmy.The decision taken by a Nassau County Supreme Court justice last year that the children should live with their mother was appealed by the news host to delay its enforcement.According to the 1,400 word opinion issued on 24 February, the court s four justices unanimously ruled in his ex-wife s favour based upon  the clearly stated preferences of the children  and the  quality of the home environment provided by the mother .Mr O Reilly s 17-year-old daughter told a court-appointed forensic examiner last year that she saw her father dragging her mother down a staircase by the neck.He responded to Politico in May last year:  All allegations against me in these circumstances are 100% false. I am going to respect the court-mandated confidentiality put in place to protect my children and will not comment any further.

2512, Whiner-In-Chief: ‘Fake Media’ Is Being Mean To ‘Wonderful’ Michael Flynn (VIDEO),"When alleged president Donald Trump doesn t like unfavorable coverage, then he calls it  fake news.  The media is striking back, though, after his repeated attacks. Trump is plagued with scandals after being on the job for just a few weeks. To address his ousted national security adviser Michael Flynn s scandal, Trump said that the former aide was subjected to  criminal  leaks in the  fake media. I think he s been treated very, very unfairly by the media   as I call it, the fake media, in many cases,  Trump said at a joint press conference Wednesday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.  I think it s really a sad thing he was treated so badly. Trump needs to get his story right with his team. White House press secretary Sean Spicer said just yesterday that Trump demanded Flynn s resignation because of  trust  issues.Trump thinks the disgraced retired General is a swell guy:Trump called Flynn a  wonderful man  and doubled down on his condemnation of the leaks from the intelligence community that exposed Flynn misled senior officials in the White House about his conversations with Russia s ambassador. Those conversations took place the day that then-President Obama imposed sanctions on Russia for its interference in the election. From intelligence, papers are being leaked, things are being leaked, it s criminal action. It s a criminal act, and it s been going on for a long time before me, but now it s really going on,  Trump said.Watch:  People are trying to cover up for a terrible loss that the Democrats had under Hillary Clinton,  he added.He said the same thing on Twitter this morning. He s blaming Hillary Clinton for his scandal-plagued administration.This Russian connection non-sense is merely an attempt to cover-up the many mistakes made in Hillary Clinton s losing campaign.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 15, 2017This morning he lashed out about the leaks. Funny thing about that: In 2016, Trump said,  I love WikiLeaks!

3971, Obama Just OBLITERATED The GOP’s Threat To Kill The Supreme Court If Hillary Wins,"This election is all about the Supreme Court, and nobody s been hammering that point more than Republicans. They say that if Hillary s elected, she ll nominate liberal judges who will take away all our rights and freedoms, or something, because that s totally how the judicial branch works. To that end, the GOP has pretty much said they ll block all her nominees, just as they ve blocked Merrick Garland, the justice Obama nominated to replace Justice Scalia.To nobody s surprise, Obama is pissed off about this, as well he should be because now they re just being childish and petty. The Senate GOP originally said that they won t consider Garland because they think the American people should decide who replaces Scalia. Now they re going back on even that, and Obama put a nice, sharp point on their hypocrisy earlier today: Now they re saying,  Well, if [the people] don t decide the way we want them to decide, maybe we won t even do that.  Eleven years ago, Richard Burr said a Supreme Court without nine justices would not work. Well, what changed? What, only Republican presidents get to nominate judges? Is that in the Constitution? I used to teach constitutional law. I ve never seen that provision.  [emphasis mine] What, only Republican presidents get to nominate judges?  Obama goes to town on GOP senators floating a SCOTUS blockade under Clinton. pic.twitter.com/LcSXveJukJ  Sahil Kapur (@sahilkapur) November 2, 2016BOOM. With their  my way or the highway,  position, they ve proved once and for all that this has nothing to do with having the American people decide anything. It proves that they don t care about creating a Constitutional crisis if it gets them what they want. It s about knowing that they ll lose even more power if a Democratic president is allowed any more Supreme Court justices   the will of the people be damned.And power is all they care about. At this point, they don t care how they get it and keep it as long as they do it.If Hillary s elected next Tuesday, the American people will have decided, even if they decided against Republicans rather than deciding for Democrats. The nominees of Democratic presidents deserve a fair hearing and vote. It s a truly terrible situation for the GOP, but, well, they ve been digging their own graves for six years.

A quick rewind revealed that she had, in fact, taken a header right in front of Ted And Heidi. How would they react? Would they look for her reaction first to see if she was OK and make a clever joke out of it like,  Carly just gets so excited to see Ted.  Or do you show immediate concern for your friend and hopeful future Vice-President of the United States? Here s how Ted Cruz handled the situation:Wasn t that classy?

15701,RESPECT: HOLLYWOOD ACTOR VOLUNTEERS TO FIGHT ISIS IN SYRIA,"Not every Hollywood actor is a liberal nut job with no understanding of the real world the rest of us are living in some of them, like actor Michael Enright are actually heros Michael Enright is one of the several hundred Westerners who have traveled to Iraq and Syria to join Kurdish combat units and fight the Islamic State.He s an unusual volunteer in several respects: he s 51 years old, the first time he handled a gun was at a shooting range right before he left for Syria, and he is almost certainly the only YPG fighter who has appeared in movies with Tom Cruise and Johnny Depp. Enright was in good spirits when he talked with the UK Daily Mail over the weekend about his decision to take up arms against ISIS and his experiences in Syria thus far. He does not seem to have received any special treatment from the Kurdish YPG militia due to his pre-war occupation and connections with celebrities, and he does not want any. He is not looking to hold down a desk at some Kurdish media office; he came to fight. Where I m going in the next two days, say a prayer for me, because I ll be going to a place which has a lot of action, a lot of fighting,  he told the Daily Mail. He has already done a month s worth of guard duty on the front lines, watching coalition fighter jets attack ISIS forces.He would like to see a bit more of that, he says. The Daily Mail describes Enright as  angry that Britain is not bombing Islamic State targets in Syria, concentrating instead on Iraq.  He thinks the Kurds could defeat ISIS in Syria with more air cover.  We re out gunned, and we re out manned. We need the air support,  he said.Enright s story is breathtaking in its simplicity: he beheld the horrors of ISIS and felt it was his duty to his native Britain, the America where he prospered, and the victims of Islamic State atrocities to do something about it. Fortunately, he had a friend in the British SAS who could put him in touch with the Kurdish YPG militia. He made his arrangements quietly, without telling family or friends, because he feared they would try to talk him out of it. He brought everyone in his life up to speed with a Facebook post after he arrived in Syria. For me, the biggest regret of my life was not going to Afghanistan when 9/11 happened,  he told the Daily Mail.  The beheading videos brought out the same kind of feelings in me, and a real sense that I had a duty to America. I really feel a debt to the country. You know, they welcomed me with open arms. And then what added to it all was that it was an Englishman, that he had an English accent,  Enright continued, referring to  Jihadi John,  the British-expatriate host of many beheading videos.  And I just, it just touched me personally, in a very deep way.  He said the last straw was ISIS burning captured Jordanian pilot Mu ath al-Kassasbeh alive in a cage. He watches that video on his smartphone whenever he needs a jolt of motivation for his military duties.It is not ironic or sarcastic to say that Enright s journey would make an amazing movie; his story of trying to hook up with YPG contacts in Iraqi Kurdistan is as harrowing as anything you ll find in an espionage thriller. His training alongside Kurdish fighters, as a gentleman of a certain age without any prior military experience, would make for a fine bit of action-comedy: imagine the Kurdish equivalent of R. Lee Ermey screaming,  You think you re special because you were in a Pirates of the Caribbean movie, maggot? Drop and gimme fifty! There is no sense whatsoever that he is thinking along those lines. (For the record, Enright describes his training as a combination of weapons drills, language classes, and  running up and down hills, basically.  To his surprise, he turned out to be a naturally gifted rifleman. He sleeps alongside his AK-47, which he has named  Olga. )Enright is very serious about what he is doing, well aware of the risks he s taking, and conscious of all that he left behind, including a sister who was recently diagnosed with cancer.  She s going through radiotherapy right now,  he said.  And so I m just hoping that we both get through it. To borrow a line from a previous generation of men who answered the call to battle, Enright won t be coming home until it s over, over there. He said he s not homesick after two months in the country.  I m very happy to be here, to be doing something that I think will outlast me,  he declared.Enright described ISIS as an  abomination  and said their atrocities were  a call to humanity, it s a call to everybody, to do whatever we can, in whatever way we can.  He said he wants to  absolutely annihilate them, and kill them on sight. Whether or not he winds up documenting his experiences in Hollywood film, he has no intention of appearing in any Islamic State beheading videos. He is well aware of the terror state s $100,000 bounty for Western hostages and says he keeps a bullet in reserve for himself, in case he s about to be captured. Here s hoping you don t need that one, warrior.Via: Breitbart News",politics,"May 14, 2015"

They are so furious, in fact, that they will be using an old tactic from the 1960s Civil Rights Movement to force Gov. Pat McCrory to repeal the law: sit-ins.Matt Barber, who is the president of the North Carolina NAACP, says he is giving McCrory until April 21st to get rid of this terrible law, or there will be sit-ins until he does. Barber says of the law: We cannot be silent in the face of this race-based, class-based, homophobic and transphobic attack on wage earners, civil rights, and the LGBTQ community. Together with our many allies, we will coordinate a campaign of nonviolent direct action along with other forms of nonviolent protest that will instruct our legislators with respect to the rights of all people. Because the next session of the House doesn t start until the 25th of April, they would need a special session to meet Barber s demands by his April 21st deadline. Barber s Forward Together Moral Movement is behind the organization of the sit-ins, and more information will be forthcoming. They are also the group responsible for North Carolina s now-famous Moral Monday activist activities.Of course, the bigots on the wrong side of history are not going quietly into the dustbins of history where they belong, either. The Christian Action League of North Carolina has already planned a rally in Raleigh, the state s capitol, to stand in solidarity with the bigoted lawmakers who made discrimination legal. This event will take place this coming Monday, and there will be counter protests as well.Another event will be held at the governor s mansion on this coming Wednesday, and it isn t your usual protest either. A group of people will assemble an air horn orchestra  in order surround McCrory s home with lots of loud noise. He really ought to love that one.Bravo, NAACP. Thank you for your support, and for standing on the right side of history.Gov. McCrory   Shame on you.Featured image via Equality NC Twitter",News,"April 8, 2016"
7586, Racists Lose Their Minds After Mexican-American Teen Sings National Anthem At Dem Debate (TWEETS)," Wednesday night was the final Democratic debate before the March 15 Primaries, and it was heated. However, the biggest controversy of the night didn t come from the candidates sparring with each other. It came when a Mexican-American teenager sang the National Anthem at the beginning of the debate. Apparently, white America believes only Caucasians are allowed to sing that song.Fifteen-year-old Sebastien de la Cruz took the stage before the debate and sang a beautiful rendition of our national song. He has an amazing voice for someone so young and of course, given the fact that it was a Univision debate, it made sense that a Latino/a give the performance. Racists, however, weren t interested in praising the child for his vocal abilities or using common sense; instead, they decided to spew hate all over Twitter, because they are a$$holes.Here are some of their responses: .CNN this is the dumbest thing I ve quite possibly ever saw. For a minute I forgot I was in #America until they sang the national anthem.

In 2013, the then 13-year-old sang the  Star-Spangled Banner  before Game 3 of the NBA finals and the scummiest Americans reacted in the same way. They called him all sorts of names, but his response was perfect:  My father was actually in the [U.S.] Navy for a really long time,  De La Cruz told San Antonio Fox 29 in an interview about the backlash.  People don t know; they just assume that I m just Mexican. But I m not from Mexico. I m from San Antonio, born and raised, a true San Antonio Spurs fan. Fortunately, the positive comments far outweighed the negative this time around. Sadly, though, he will probably always be the target of scumbags who hate him just because his skin is tanner than theirs.

4625, Ivanka Trump Whines After Interviewer Points Out That Her Dad Thinks Pregnancy Is Bad For Business,"Ivanka Trump s maternity leave plan hit a wall during an interview with Cosmopolitan when she was asked about her father s belief that pregnant women are an inconvenience.Republican nominee Donald Trump is clearly pandering to women by suddenly coming out in support of paid maternity leave in a desperate ploy to get women to vote for him.As it stands, over 70 percent of women view Trump unfavorably and Hillary Clinton would win the women s vote by an even wider margin than President Obama did in 2012.So, Trump is hoping that women will automatically switch their allegiance to him if he offers maternity leave to the country, something he hasn t even offered to his own female employees unless their name is Ivanka Trump.According to the Huffington Post:Employees at the Trump SoHo, New York and Miami hotels, as well as the Mar-a-Lago Club in Florida, all said that they do not offer workers paid maternity leave. Instead, they said that the company complied with the Family and Medical Leave Act, a federal law that requires companies to give employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid time off for the adoption or birth of a child.That little hypocrisy combined with The Donald s past comments about women and pregnancy is exactly why Ivanka s interview with Cosmopolitan was so disastrous.Prachi Gupta asked Trump s daughter about a remark he made back in 2004 when he called pregnancy an inconvenience to business. It s certainly an inconvenience for a business,  he said.  And whether people want to say that or not, the fact is it is an inconvenience for a person that is running a business. Donald Trump said that pregnancy is an inconvenient thing for a business,  Gupta informed Ivanka.  It s surprising to see this policy from him today. Can you talk a little bit about those comments, and perhaps what has changed? Ivanka responded by accusing Gupta of being negative and then bragged about how her dad is a champion for women in the workplace. So I think that you have a lot of negativity in these questions, and I think my father has put forth a very comprehensive and really revolutionary plan to deal with a lot of issues. So I don t know how useful it is to spend too much time with you on this if you re going to make a comment like that. My father obviously has a track record of decades of employing women at every level of his company, and supporting women, and supporting them in their professional capacity, and enabling them to thrive outside of the office and within. To imply otherwise is an unfair characterization of his track record and his support of professional women. So the policies at our company reflect that, and the diversity of our workforce, from a gender perspective, and in all perspectives, reflects that. So my father has been a great advocate for the women in the workforce, and that s part of why he recognized that reform is so necessary. Except that Trump doesn t even offer women paid maternity leave at his own hotels and resorts. Instead they have to take unpaid leave and even to get that they have to use vacation and sick days. In other words, in order for a new mother to get unpaid leave, she would have to sacrifice her paid vacation and sick days to get it.When pressed, Ivanka claimed ignorance of the comments. Well, here s the video of Trump saying it via NBC.Ivanka then cut the interview short rather than stick around any longer to answer hard questions.Donald Trump does not care about women. He is only pretending to because he wants their votes. If he gets elected there is no way he would fight for paid maternity leave. It would require him to give it to all of his female employees and he won t do that because it would mean having to give up money that could go towards buying himself a gold-plated toilet or another luxury jet.If he really cared about women he wouldn t have been treating them like shit over all these years and he wouldn t be treating them like shit now. But Trump thinks women are stupid and that they ll support him just because he suddenly supports a policy that he has always opposed.Featured image via screen capture",News,"September 15, 2016"
11339,RAND PAUL: SOMEBODY WAS SPYING On Trump Campaign…It’s “already been proven to be true” [VIDEO],"FOX News  Neil Cavuto asked Senator Rand Paul if he believed surveillance was used against the Trump campaign. Rand replied to Cavuto by saying they already have evidence that surveillance of the campaign took place, Everybody admits that somebody spied on Mike Flynn and he was part of the Trump campaign. So it sounds like what the President said has already been proven to be true. Somebody listened to Mike Flynn s conversation and revealed it  to the press, which is a felony. And you don t do that unless you somehow eavesdropped on his  phone conversation. The media s been kinda confused about this. They think there has to be an old-fashioned bug placed on a wire If you haven t looked lately, most of our cell phones don t have wires. So wire tapping is a broad term for surveillance. Somebody did surveil. Somebody spied on Mike Flynn and then illegally released that conversation.

6445," Well It Happened, Trump Gets Desperate And Goes Full BENGHAZI On Hillary (TWEET)","It would appear that Donald Trump knows his base of voters don t pay attention to facts and reality, so he s going to keep perpetuating myths and propaganda to anger these people into voting for him even though his claims hold no basis in reality. And in the world of politics and mudslinging, it doesn t much matter as long as your message sticks and you get votes. However, these lies will get debunked, and there s nothing to stop that either.It s become very clear at this point that the presumptive Republican nominee has switched into attack mode against Democratic front-funner Hillary Clinton. If he s not going after her for what her husband did, he s going after her for literally being a woman.Now, knowing how much many conservatives can t wrap their heads around the fact that the Obama administration, including then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, did no wrongdoing in regards to the attack on Americans in Benghazi, Libya, he s going to keep pushing the issue anyway. Never mind the fact that there has been probe after probe after probe.Trump tweeted this out to stir the pot, yet again:Hillary has bad judgment! https://t.co/LhcIU6kmxs  Donald J.

There is a very strong likelihood that before all this happened, Trump thought Libya was a female body part, so he s clearly just using this as an attack plan and may not even understand all the details of the event in question. He s a bully though, and being a bully he s going to keep ripping at old scabs even though they re all dried up.When every poll shows Hillary Clinton wiping the floor with Trump among women, minorities and the youth vote, he s got to do something. He s desperate, and this is likely just one of many desperate moves to come out of the Trump campaign.Bringing up Benghazi again after Clinton has been cleared again and again and again. C mon now, Donald. That s just pathetic, and clearly a distraction tactic away from the fact that you are most certainly not prepared to be the leader of the free world.Featured Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"May 10, 2016"
22769,"REVEALED: FBI Aided, Abetted ‘ISIS’ Terrorist Attack at ‘Mohammed Cartoon Event’ in Garland, Texas","Daily Shooter 21st Century WireJust as ISIS is being routed in Deir Ezzor, Syria, and soon out of Raqqa, and driven from its remaining strongholds in Iraq   we discover how the US government has been busy keeping the organization thriving within its own shores.What you are about to read is simply breathtaking, but should be of no surprise to our readers. These new court findings reaffirms much of what 21WIRE and the Daily Shooter column have been reporting for the last five years   that the FBI is responsible for the majority of so-called  terrorist  attacks in the US.According to a new legal case filed against the FBI, court filings have revealed how the agency allowed an alleged  home grown  ISIS attack to take place in Garland, Texas on May 4, 2015. International criminal lawyer Jennifer Breedon shows the FBI was complicit in the attack, and even enticed the two terrorists to carry out the attack, and where agents had  pretended to be ISIS  in order to keep their entrapment operation going. She explains: Some of the facts are indicating that they had an undercover agent that was trying to get in with ISIS   trying to find out these ISIS groups, and he wanted to make himself higher up in ISIS ranks to know more of their fighters. Apparently, he stayed in the car behind them, which came out in another case filing with the FBI. They did not prevent it because if the attack had been carried out successfully, and people died, it was likely this undercover agent and his supervisors in the FBI felt that this would promote him up to high ranks within ISIS   the undercover agent would be promoted up, because the attack was then successful. Read Breddon s full interview here.On the surface this is a clear case of entrapment by the FBI, but upon deeper examination it s now clear that the FBI seems to have aided and abetted a terrorist attack on US soil.While other mainstream and alternative media outlets were busy promulgating the official narrative, 21WIRE actually called-out the staged event, designed to leverage a far right, anti-Muslim agenda, and stoke irrational fears of endless  ISIS attacks  on US soil.PROVOCATEUR: Professional provocateur Geller provided the PR bait for media, the FBI-run  American ISIS  cell.The contrived event was marketed as a controversial  Muhammad Art Exhibit and Cartoon Contest,  organized by a cut-out politcal front group, American Freedom Defense Initiative, led by anti-Muslim activist and professional provocateur, Pamela Geller, and featured far-right Dutch politician Geert Wilders, as its keynote speaker. Media personality Geller claimed to have purposely chosen the venue following the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) gathering who held a  Stand with the Prophet  conference in late January 2015 after the Charlie Hebdo shootings in Paris earlier that year.According to the victim s attorney Breedon, the FBI had an undercover agent that was  trying to get in with ISIS   trying to find out these ISIS groups, and he wanted to make himself higher up in ISIS ranks to know more of their fighters. American journalist Trevor Aaronson further explains the derelict role of James Comey (image, left) in FBI s attempt to cover its own fingerprints on this dodgy operation: Hours earlier, the FBI had sent a bulletin to local police with Elton Simpson s photo, warning that he was  interested in the event. FBI Director James Comey said in a press conference following the shooting that the FBI did not have reason to believe Simpson was planning to attack the event, even though the bureau had spent years trying to build a case against him. ENTRAPMENT: The unwitting youngster, Elton Simpson, was groomed by a paid FBI informant, and brought to the scene of the staged  attack. After the FBI-staged  attack , 21WIRE was one of few media outlets to report how a paid FBI informant was not only  handling , but directing what appeared to be a naive and vulnerable federal target for entrapment   a new young Muslim convert named Elton Simpson from Phoenix, Arizona:It s now been revealed that  gunman , Elton Simpson, was already under surveillance by the FBI and was even the subject of a terror investigation. More importantly, we can also confirm Simpson was being handled by an FBI informant. Court papers filed in Arizona name the FBI undercover informant as Mr. Daba Deng, a Kenyan and who, from 2007, was paid $132,000 by the FBI to  become friends with Mr. Simpson , and who appears to have groomed Simpson through a local mosque, and helped to develop Simpson s ideas about  jihad .So keen was CNN at the time to convince its audience that Garland was a real terrorist event, it took the trouble of creating its own cartoon version of the attack in a desperate attempt to make the official story believable:SYNTHETIC TERROR: CNN uses cartoon to make the Garland Shooting look like a real terror event.At the time, and almost comically, CNN tried to push the official narrative, appearing totally clueless of the fact that the attackers were under FBI supervision for years: He wasn t well-known to federal law enforcement and was not on the FBI s radar, one of the officials said. Investigators were combing through evidence retrieved from the shooters  Arizona home to help piece together a timeline of how their plot came together, the official said. It was as if CNN had copied and pasted their report from an FBI press memo issued after the event (perhaps it was). CNN s coverage of the event was equally ridiculous, not picking up on the fact that a small platoon of heavily armed US special ops mercenaries were pre-positioned at Geller s event in anticipation of the made-for-TV  terror  attack that followed:#BREAKING Update from SWAT Team Leader. @wfaachannel8 pic.twitter.com/HoF5f4bF7U  Jobin Panicker (@jobinpnews) May 4, 2015SEE OUR INITIAL REPORT ON GELLER S GARLAND HOAX: Hebdo Redux in Garland, Texas?

22113,Washington’s Criminal Activities Are Only Getting Messier,"21st Century Wire says It was a major scandal that broke out in 2009. Academi, formerly known as Blackwater, was accused of murdering civilians and smuggling weapons in Middle East ops.Further to the prosecution of four Blackwater employees five years later, guilty of killing 17 Iraqi civilians in Baghdad during one spate of violence, there has been a historical boom of private contractors occurring since Iraq and Afghanistan incursions began.More on this report from New Eastern Outlook  Martin Berger New Eastern OutlookThe unpunished slaughter of thousands of civilians in Iraq, Syria, and Afghanistan carried out by the US over the course of the last decade is now being gradually replaced by new types of crimes committed by Washington s henchmen in the course of its ongoing instances of armed aggression against sovereign states.As it s been reported by Bloomberg with a special reference to AP, a well-known American contractor firm Sallyport Global has recently been engaged in a number of illegal operations in Baghdad s vicinity. According to the report, its employees would get engaged in alcohol smuggling and slave trade. It s curious that Sallyport Global s staff would overload cargo planes with illegal alcohol so hard that they could barely fly, while stealing generators and armored off-road vehicles from the Balad air base that they were dispatched to protect. Bloomberg would note that some of company s employees were also involved in selling local residents to sex slavery.Meanwhile, it is a well-known fact that Sallyport Global received 686 million dollars from the US government to fulfill a number of missions in the best interests of the American people. Or at least it was supposed to.One could also recall a major scandal that broke out back in 2009, when a military contractor firm Academi (that was called Blackwater back in the day) was accused of murdering civilians and smuggling weapons. Five years later the jury in the state of Washington found four employees of the Blackwater private company guilty of killing 17 Iraqi civilians in Baghdad in just one instance of violence. After this attack Iraqi authorities demanded that Blackwater paid 8 million dollars in compensation to each of the 17 families whose relatives were murdered in the raid that its employers conducted. Additionally, local authorities demanded that a total of 250 both former and acting employees of Blackwater would leave Iraq within a week after the tragic event.As soon as the US military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan began, along with an number of other military interventions across the globe, the number of private companies involved in providing so-called  security services  to the Pentagon started booming.In the absence of any independent audit, the actual number of military contractors deployed in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria and other countries can only be guessed, since the official evaluation provided by the Pentagon is pretty misleading. The tangled web of contractors and subcontractors and the lack of any comprehensive control led to the situation when even the top US officials had no real information on the actual of number of US contractors deployed in a particular country. Thus, when the Congress demanded the Interim Coalition Administration (ICA) of Iraq to provide it with the exact number of military contractors deployed in the country back in 2004, it took the latter quite a lot of time to draft a list of 60 firms employing a total of 20,000 people. However, six year later the number of people employed by the Pentagon, the State Department and the United States Agency for International Development to carry out security related missions in Iraq and Afghanistan exceeded 260,000 people with only every fourth contractor being an American citizen. At times, the number of contractors deployed exceeded the total number of troops US Armed Forces had in these two countries.Private military firms carry out a wide range of missions in the areas controlled by the US military personnel, such as the participation in actual combat engagements, reconnaissance missions, special operations, carrying out security tasks and logistical support. They have also been training local army and police units that are loyal to the forces that Washington supports. Private contractor firms are playing an important role in ensuring that the situation in a certain country, occupied by the United States, remains under control. The best example of a wide range of activities that military contractors are engaged in is the fact that the people employed by the Anteon International have been maintaining communications systems that Pentagon is using for its operations.In Afghanistan, for example, such military contractor firms as MPRI, Sandline, Control Risk Group, Chilport, along with Israeli Golan Group and Beni Tal were deployed long before the actual invasion began. Back then the CIA was determined to send the maximum possible number of infiltration groups that were formed out of employees of private intelligence companies. Those groups were tasked with the mission of killing Osama bin Laden and other leaders of the Taliban movement. Additionally, they were demanded to get engaged in the bribing of local warlords, collecting operational data, conducting reconnaissance and carrying out acts of sabotage.To this date Washington relies heavily on the services that private intelligence companies would provide. This phenomenon can be explained by the fact that Middle Eastern warlords are getting extremely violent when they find a snitch in their ranks, which results in his death and, quite possible, the deaths of all of his relatives, regardless of the degree of kinship, age and sex. This is the main reason behind the reluctance that most locals towards cooperating with the occupying force. So in a situation when the CIA cannot establish a comprehensive intelligence network, contractors are the only people that lend it a helping hand.The large-scale involvement of private contractor firms led to the practice of bribing local commanders, when money are being paid for the relative security that the employees of such a firm can enjoy in a certain territory. Thus, an impressive margin of all the money that such firms are getting end up in the pockets of the Taliban movement leaders, who are acting in the capacity of some sort of subcontractors. According to official data, the Taliban movement has received over 360 million dollars from the US budget for the services it has been providing to private contractor firms. This number constitutes the second largest sources of income for the mujahideen movement, with the proceeds from drug trade still occupying the top of the list.When the number of US troops in certain conflict zones of abroad decreases, it is usually accompanied by an increase in the number of employees of private contractor firms willing to risk their heads for a paycheck...Continue this report at New Eastern OutlookREAD MORE WASHINGTON NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire WASHINGTON FilesSUPPORT OUR WORK BY SUBSCRIBING & BECOMING A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",US_News,"May 9, 2017"
15111,“TRAITOR IN CHIEF” WARNS CONGRESS…Shut Down Prison With Muslim Terrorists Or I’ll Stop Funding Military [VIDEO],"Name one time this reckless  Commander in Chief  has put our men and women in uniform before the war on terror Just one.On Monday, the Obama administration announced that President Obama would veto a defense authorization bill if it did not close down Guantanamo Bay. White House press secretary Josh Earnest explained that the House funding bill would be vetoed  principally because of the irresponsible way that it funds our national defense priorities, but also because of the efforts to prevent the closure [of] the prison at Guantanamo Bay.  He added that Democrats would sustain Obama s veto, and defense authorization would die.Obama s strong stand on Gitmo underscores two vital points. First, President Obama does not fear defunding America s national security. Second, Obama does not fear Republicans in Congress.The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) has been authorized for five decades running. The current NDAA fully funds the military through a workaround measure, thanks to President Obama s demands that a huge chunk of sequestration cuts come from defense funding. Now Democrats complain that the workaround measure isn t good enough: Republicans should bust open the bank again.But that s not Obama s main criticism of the NDAA. He has long had a bug in his ear with regard to Gitmo, which he feels has strengthened terrorists  feelings about the evils of the United States. Given his recent moves to parlay with the Cuban dictatorship as well, Obama may want to hand Gitmo in totality back to the Cuban government. The fact that Obama would be willing to dramatically cut America s military funding, even as Russia takes over Ukraine and Syria, as Iran gears up for a big regional military push, as China continues its aggressive behavior in the South China Sea, demonstrates Obama s top priority is doing leftist work, not protecting the United States.In fact, Obama s choice to prioritize Gitmo above national security isn t a choice at all: Obama wants America s military slashed, and he wants Gitmo closed. Senator Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) agrees with Obama that Gitmo should be closed, but even he says that Obama has manipulated the process to create an impasse. According to Roll Call, McCain  has said the White House promised him a plan to close the prison, but has yet to present one. Without that, he has said he wouldn t be able to find the votes to do what the White House wants. Now, normally, Obama s nasty priorities would pose little threat to military funding: after all, Obama would be stymied by Republicans in Congress. And Obama has threatened to veto the NDAA before over Guantanamo; each time, Congress has called Obama s bluff, and he has signed the bill into law.But this time, the feeling is that Obama could be more serious. After all, with the legacy of Republicans folding on executive amnesty, the Iran deal, and funding for Planned Parenthood, among others, Obama probably feels he can leverage Gitmo out of existence. He believes that Republicans fear defense defunding more than he must   their constituents will hold them accountable, while he s in pure  f*** it list  mode. He also thinks that Republicans are unwilling to undergo a head-to-head matchup with him under almost any circumstances.And Obama is right. In his entire tenure as Commander-in-Chief, Obama has had to issue a grand total of four vetoes. Four. That s less than every president since Chester A. Arthur, who filled out James Garfield s term, serving less than four years. Obama has had a fully Republican Congress this year, and a Republican House since 2010. He has issued just two vetoes this year, one with regard to Keystone XL Pipeline, and the other with regard to a bill related to the National Labor Relations Board. All of his other major policy priorities have been guarded zealously by a Democratic minority or an unwilling Republican majority.So why wouldn t Obama try to hold Republicans  feet to the fire on defense authorization?Obama s mastery of Congress is unprecedented in American history; the only other candidates for that title either held Congressional dominance within their own party (Franklin Delano Roosevelt) or ruled a Congressional rump (Abraham Lincoln). Shutting down America s defense funding would be a crowning achievement for a president who cares more about weakening America s role in the world than defending her citizens.Via: Breitbart News",politics,"Oct 8, 2015"

Code-named  Vault 7  by WikiLeaks, it is the largest ever publication of confidential documents on the agency.The first full part of the series,  Year Zero , comprises 8,761 documents and files from an isolated, high-security network situated inside the CIA s Center for Cyber Intelligence in Langley, Virgina. It follows an introductory disclosure last month of CIA targeting French political parties and candidates in the lead up to the 2012 presidential election.Recently, the CIA lost control of the majority of its hacking arsenal including malware, viruses, trojans, weaponized  zero day  exploits, malware remote control systems and associated documentation. This extraordinary collection, which amounts to more than several hundred million lines of code, gives its possessor the entire hacking capacity of the CIA. The archive appears to have been circulated among former U.S. government hackers and contractors in an unauthorized manner, one of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive. Year Zero  introduces the scope and direction of the CIA s global covert hacking program, its malware arsenal and dozens of  zero day  weaponized exploits against a wide range of U.S. and European company products, include Apple s iPhone, Google s Android and Microsoft s Windows and even Samsung TVs, which are turned into covert microphones.Since 2001 the CIA has gained political and budgetary preeminence over the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA). The CIA found itself building not just its now infamous drone fleet, but a very different type of covert, globe-spanning force   its own substantial fleet of hackers. The agency s hacking division freed it from having to disclose its often controversial operations to the NSA (its primary bureaucratic rival) in order to draw on the NSA s hacking capacities.By the end of 2016, the CIA s hacking division, which formally falls under the agency s Center for Cyber Intelligence (CCI), had over 5000 registered users and had produced more than a thousand hacking systems, trojans, viruses, and other  weaponized  malware. Such is the scale of the CIA s undertaking that by 2016, its hackers had utilized more code than that used to run Facebook. The CIA had created, in effect, its  own NSA  with even less accountability and without publicly answering the question as to whether such a massive budgetary spend on duplicating the capacities of a rival agency could be justified.In a statement to WikiLeaks the source details policy questions that they say urgently need to be debated in public, including whether the CIA s hacking capabilities exceed its mandated powers and the problem of public oversight of the agency. The source wishes to initiate a public debate about the security, creation, use, proliferation and democratic control of cyberweapons.CHINA IS ALSO GETTING IN ON THE ACT:",Government News,"Mar 7, 2017"

18610,CROOKED HILLARY CLINTON’S Latest Speech To Be Crashed By Angry HAITIANS Pushing For Answers,"Hillary Clinton always goes back to the black community and this is just another case of pandering. It s pretty sickening that she s even being asked to speak at a college commencement ANY college commencement! The Clinton GRIFTERS also owe the Haitian community answers on where money went after the Haiti earthquake relief effort.  The Haitian community is up in arms over much that happened after the 2010 earthquake. This should be interesting:Here is how the Clinton s used the money that Americans donated to help the devastated residents of Haiti to enrich themselves:On June 8, Hillary Clinton is scheduled to serve as the Class of 2017 commencement speaker at Medgar Evers College in Brooklyn, New York, where she will also be awarded an honorary degree. The announcement has incited protests from several members of the Haitian community who plan to protest the speech and are pushing the college s president, Rudy Crew, to rescind the invitation.PANDERING TO THE BLACK COMMUNITY IN TIMES OF TROUBLE: Every time the Clintons get in a bind, they run to the black community to whitewash their tarnished image,  said Komokoda, the Haitian group protesting the speech, in a statement.  After Bill Clinton was impeached for lying under oath in the Monica Lewinsky affair, he brought in Jesse Jackson and a host of black preachers to lead prayers with him at the White House. To divert attention from her  deleted emails  debacle, Hillary had Bill DeBlasio s wife, Chirlane McCray, bring her to Brownsville, one of the most impoverished neighborhoods in Brooklyn, for a photo op with little black children. When newspaper editorials and cartoons were blasting her for her unending lies and demanding investigations and prosecutions, former New York City mayor David Dinkins brought her out for a keynote speech at his Dinkins Leadership & Public Policy Forum at Columbia University. Today, for her resurrection from a shameful defeat by the last person most reasonable people felt could ever be president of the United States, the dirty work falls to Rudy Crew. HAITI RELIEF SCAM   QUESTIONS REMAIN:The Clintons  role in Haiti has incited immense criticism and has tarnished their relationship with the Haitian community. In 2010, Haiti suffered a massive earthquake. Several NGOs and the United Nations flocked to Haiti to help relief efforts, but their intervention came with several costs. In 2011, UN Peacekeepers caused a massive cholera outbreak that killed at least 9,500 people and sickened 800,000 others. During this time, Bill Clinton served as the United Nations Special Envoy to Haiti while Hillary Clinton served as secretary of state. While the Clinton Foundation has staunchly defended their role in Haiti, their involvement in the country has been far from successful.  Many of the most notable investments the Clintons helped launch, such as the new Marriott in the capital, have primarily benefited wealthy foreigners and the island s ruling elite, who needed little help to begin with,  wrote Jonathan Katz for Politico in 2015.For Komokoda and many Haitians, the Clintons epitomize NGOs and corporations exploiting the crisis and relief efforts in Haiti for their own gain. Haitians also blame the Clintons for the controversial rule of former Haitian President Michel Martelly, who stepped down in February 2016 due to his record of corruption after the Clintons helped him get elected in 2010.MORE ON THE CLINTON FOUNDATION SCAM ON HAITI:Read more: Observer",left-news,"May 19, 2017"
6483," 40,000 MA Drug Cases Could Be Thrown Out Because Of Drug Stealing Lab Scandal","A Massachusetts crime lab scandal could result in tens of thousands of criminal convictions being overturned. It s not the first time this has happened in the state either.As Addicting Info reported in May of last year, up to 60,000 drug cases were impacted by a scandal that rocked the Hinton Drug Lab, located in Boston, MA.In that case, a chemist by the name of Annie Dookhan plead guilty to 27 criminal charges, including  tampering with evidence, violating the state witness intimidation statute, multiple counts of lying to a grand jury, falsely claiming to carry a degree and others. Over a 14 year period, Dookhan forged documents, testified falsely in criminal cases and tampered with test results while employed as a chemist at the state crime lab.After Dookhan s confession thousands of convictions were overturned and hundreds of cases, which were still pending, were dismissed.The state of MA conducted a 15-month-long investigation into the crime lab, finding  a pattern of neglect, mismanagement, and poor standards. In spite of the state s findings, no other employees faced criminal charges. The Hinton lab was eventually closed down.Now another MA drug lab is facing a massive backlash, after court documents revealed a separate scandal involving drug use, evidence tampering and a series of other crimes earlier this week.As the Boston Herald reports, Amherst state lab chemist Sonja Farak was convicted in 2014 of tampering with evidence, theft and drug use inside the crime lab, where she was employed for more than eight years.At the height of her criminal activity, Farak was smoking crack ten to twelve times a day inside the crime lab, as well as using a host of other drugs which she obtained through the lab.Farak confessed to using the drugs at her work station, where she also tested samples submitted by law enforcement.She also confessed to being high while giving testimony in criminal cases and during interviews with police.While she was convicted of multiple crimes in 2014, officials did not disclose important details about how Farak s criminal activities had likely compromised tens of thousands of cases that she worked on.It took an order from the state Supreme Court to finally bring the extent of her misconduct to light.The ACLU released a statement on the Farak case, saying: The magnitude of the Amherst Lab misconduct rivals the similar scandal at the Hinton Lab, involving disgraced chemist Annie Dookhan, and the twin Massachusetts scandals have no known parallel elsewhere in the country. Matthew Segal, legal director of the ACLU of Massachusetts, went on to state: There is only one sensible response to these revelations: promptly notify the people who were denied due process, undo their wrongful convictions, and rethink the unjust war on drugs. The Boston Herald reports that Farak may have tainted the results in as many as 40,000 cases during the eight years she worked as a state crime lab chemist.Combined, the Dookhan and Farak scandals in MA alone could easily have caused more than 100,000 innocent people to be wrongfully imprisoned.If rampant corruption in just two state crime labs can result in the destruction of so many lives, we have to ask ourselves what is the impact when combined with corrupt law enforcement, corrupt courts and a corrupt penal system that thrives on profit?As the ACLU states here, fighting the failed war on drugs has only served to undermine the integrity of the entire criminal justice system.It s time to end the failed drug war, once and for all.Image credit: Wikimedia Commons",News,"May 8, 2016"
8950, Ted Cruz Goes FULL Right-Wing Lunatic Trying To Raise Support Off Obama’s Gun Actions (IMAGES),"As they say, desperate times call for desperate measures, and as all the right-wing lunatics of the Republican party seem to be drifting towards Donald Trump, Ted Cruz knew what he had to do   go full right-wing lunatic himself.After President Obama announced his common sense executive actions for gun reform and a safer America, many Republicans were outraged. After all, fewer guns in the hands of the mentally ill means fewer massacres, which in turns means people won t be as scared and in turn go out and buy stockpiles of unnecessary firearms. Republicans, bought and paid for by the gun lobby, want to make sure people stay scared and have as many guns as possible.Well, Senator Ted Cruz, doing all he can to fear-monger his base of voters too stupid to realize they re being manipulated, decided he would have some fun with photoshop and scare people into supporting him. He sent out this to entice people:via tedcruz.orgOr from a mobile device: via tedcruz.orgMind you, President Obama said nothing of taking guns from anyone, or wanting anyone s guns. He s done nothing to, in any way, go against the Second Amendment which calls for citizens to be well regulated. Obama is simply trying to make sure existing laws are followed and the wrong people don t have access to buy firearms.Now, unless these right-wingers are terrified that they are going to be labeled the ones who are mentally ill, none of this effects them whatsoever. In fact, it strengthens the Second Amendment and the rights of law-abiding gun owners.However, Cruz, knowing his supporters are paranoid idiots, is preying on this fear for support and sends them an image of a militarized President Obama with the very false and simplistic phrase,  OBAMA WANTS YOUR GUNS,  perfectly catering to the fear these simple-minded, myopic voters have.We could say,  shame on you  to Ted Cruz for doing this, but to his credit, this sort of fear-mongering, albeit utterly inaccurate and unethical, works for Republican politicians. They have perfectly wrapped up the terrified conspiracy theorist vote, and this imagery play perfectly into that narrative.That being said, shame on you, Cruz. This is just pathetic.Featured image: tedcruz.org/flickr",News,"January 5, 2016"

Pro-Gun Control Seth (Racist) Rogen, Star Of Newly Released “Steve Jobs” Movie Sends Vulgar Tweet: “F*ck You Ben Carson”","If you only attack black conservatives, does that make you exempt from being called a  racist? When will Americans stop supporting foreigners like Josh Rogen who openly spout off about about their disdain for conservatives while advocating for gun control in our country?On the eve of the release of Universal s  Steve Jobs,  star Seth Rogen fired off a hate-tweet at black Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson.  Fuck you @realBenCarson,  the tweet said. In another tweet, Rogen, a high-profile Hillary Clinton supporter (and Canadian citizen), expressed his anger over comments Carson made about gun control and Nazi Germany.Carson believes Jews might have had a better chance at resisting the Nazi regime had they not been disarmed by that regime in advance. Rogen, who is Jewish, and much of the national media are horrified over the idea of Jews with guns fighting Nazis, something Jews did frequently throughout WWII with scrounged guns.Whether it is kids in classrooms or Jews in Nazi Germany, Carson proved this week that if you want to enrage a Leftist, suggest that they might have been better off had they been in a position to fight back.The social media backlash against both Rogen and his upcoming film was immediate, and some 12 hours later, even though it is very early in the morning, is still intense.Here is Rogan s vulgar tweet:A search of tweets containing only Seth Rogen s names finds that almost all of them are critical of the comedian s attack on Carson, many accusing Rogen of outright racism.

271, Miami Police Union Leader Joins Other Conservatives In Bashing NFL For Las Vegas Massacre,"Over 50 people are dead, and more than 500 are wounded, after a gunman opened fire on a crowd of concertgoers from the 32nd floor of Mandalay Bay on the south end of the Las Vegas strip late last night. And true to form, we re already hearing conservatives use it to push their  moar gunz  and  blue lives matter  agendas while crying that anyone begging Congress to do something real to save lives is  politicizing a tragedy. But the true political agenda comes from those who won t acknowledge that commonsense gun legislation would save lives and think that protesting racial injustice is the same thing as protesting against police officers themselves, the military, and the country. The leader of Miami s chapter of the Fraternal Order of Police, Lt. Javier Ortiz, tweeted the following:Two groups of people, one in Seattle, one in Vegas, chose to take action last night in their own way . We support the #POLICE pic.twitter.com/2S8WkpWvXl  Miami FOP 20 (@MiamiFOP20) October 2, 2017When the Miami New Times asked him to clarify, he said: While NFL players express a false perception of police officers by inciting hate and division by disrespecting the U.S. flag, the reality is law enforcement risks their lives every day for America. We don t know the motive behind Stephen Paddock s decision to break open the window of a room at Mandalay Bay and then fire multiple clips of rounds into the crowd attending the Route 91 Harvest Music Festival below. As of now, this doesn t appear to have had anything to do with hatred of police officers and we can t say it did until Paddock s motive is discovered.It s true that mass shootings and really, any crime would be worse if it weren t for the law enforcement officers who risk their lives to stop them, but Lt. Ortiz s remarks are dangerously irresponsible because they could trigger a retaliation from the people who worship the flag and think police brutality against African-Americans isn t a thing.And Ortiz isn t the only one who s slamming the NFL because of Las Vegas.

8152, Democrats May Save Oregon’s Middle Class From GOP With New Wage Law,"The Oregon State Senate has just approved a bill that would increase the state s minimum wage over the next six years in incremental steps.Democrats can be thanked for pushing the measure through on a margin of 16-12, saying that it was necessary to help lift residents out of poverty and handle increasing costs of living. One lone sellout, Democratic Senator Betsy Johnson, voted no along with all Republicans. The bill will raise the minimum wage to $14.75 in Portland, $13.50 in other urban counties, and $12.50 in rural counties to prevent harming business in lower cost of living areas. The current minimum wage in the state is $9.25, which is higher than the federal minimum. However, it still is inadequate, especially in urban areas.The bill passed after a floor debate that lasted six hours. It was introduced by Democratic Senator Michael Dembrow, of Portland. Gradual increases will take place yearly, leading up to the maximum numbers in 2022. The measure is set to move to the State House next, with expectations of approval by Governor Kate Brown.As usual, wealthy wanna-be plutocrats have come out threatening doom and gloom over the attempt to make sure Oregonians are not living in grinding poverty. Jason Brandt, CEO of the Oregon Restaurant and Lodging Association released the following statement: It will kill jobs, harm consumers, force school and government service cuts and hurt Oregon farms and small businesses. We urge the House to defeat this plan that puts election year politics ahead of Oregon s economy. Source: oregonlive.comAll that anyone needs to do is refer to Seattle Seatac, who raised its minimum wage to $15/hour. The results are amazingly good, with an unemployment rate of only 3.3 percent   a rate not seen since 2008. Seatac is also one of the fastest growing airport hubs in the United States, which destroys the myth that a living wage will stifle growth and explode unemployment.One of the most basic concepts of capitalism is lost on literally every Republican who claims to LOVE the system   the fact that more money in the hands of consumers equals higher demand which increases the need for employment. Everywhere a minimum wage goes up, unemployment tends to trend down, and the anecdotal accounts of it weeding out already-failed businesses or spiteful greedy owners can t counter the right-wing propaganda anymore. It s happening, and the positive results are not going to stop.Featured image from Twitter",News,"February 12, 2016"
13186,"DON’T EXPECT GOVERNMENT Or Black Lives Matter To Help: PRIVATE CITIZENS, FREE MARKET Provide Much Needed Help For Total Strangers In LA Flood","After Obama was embarrassed by Donald Trump acting more  presidential  than he, as Trump traveled to one of the poorest states in America bringing a semi-truck filled with needs for the LA flood victims. He finally managed to find his way off the golf course on Martha s Vineyard to visit the people who couldn t have cared less if he showed or not, by the time he got there. Like Trump said, it was  too little too late for Obama s phony photo-op.Of course, only Obama could turn the flood into a race issue. While refusing so far to survey the Louisiana flood disaster until days later, he did let state and local officials know that he s watching to make sure they don t engage in racial discrimination. In a 16-page guidance issued Tuesday, the Obama administration, led by the Justice Department, warned Louisiana recipients of federal disaster assistance against engaging in  unlawful discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin (including limited English proficiency). The guidance s frameworks  highlight the importance of complying with nondiscrimination requirements of civil rights statutes, addressing the needs of the whole community, and ensuring equal opportunity to access recovery efforts. Black residents should be asking where the thousands of Black Lives Matter protesters, who are so concerned about the lives of Blacks in America are when they really could ve used their help? George Soros, Al Sharpton and Barack are so good at organizing, why weren t they putting their heads together and coming up with a plan to help the poor black residents of LA who had lost everything they owned to the historic flooding? They can be organized in a very short time to create chaos, burn cities and loot, but where are they when they have an opportunity to do something positive for Blacks in LA? The recent flooding that hit Louisiana is the worst natural disaster to hit the United States since Hurricane Sandy hit New Jersey in 2012. So far we know that at least 13 are dead and tens of thousands were left homeless in the flooding. Even worse, most of those affected do not have flood insurance. Up to $21 billion worth of housing stock was wiped out by the deluge of rain.The recovery will be long and difficult in one of the poorest states in the country. There is the challenge of finding employment and housing for all these displaced people. Given the fact that Louisiana is a hot and humid state most of the year, there will also be the issues of dealing with mold and increased injuries as people try to rebuild.But one of the greatest stories of the Louisiana flooding is how the people and free markets are playing a role in helping to both rescue people and deliver relief much quicker than the government.Black patriot Arlene Barnum asks,  Where s the BlackLivesMatter men? Citizens to the RescueThe rains that swamped parts of Louisiana over a period of a few days were relentless. Local governments and first responders were overwhelmed with calls for help from people trapped in their homes by rising waters.#CajunNavy pic.twitter.com/hjScnNu7Gy  Ben Sanders (@BenSandersLaw) August 14, 2016Instead of waiting for the government to come rescue them, the people of Louisiana used their own privately-owned boats to save their neighbors. This  Cajun Navy  drew its ranks and fleet from Louisiana s large numbers of sportsmen. People who needed rescue contacted a Facebook group and the boats used smartphone apps such as the GPS app Glympse and the walkie talkie app Zello to coordinate. The  Cajun Navy  was responsible for saving the lives of thousands of Louisianians and their pets and livestock.#CajunNavy is shown deploying in this pic by Troy @gulfsails #BatonRougeFlood pic.twitter.com/P9yI0QRQoM  walter michot (@WalterMichot) August 15, 2016#CajunNavy doing what they can to help in #BatonRouge pic.twitter.com/7nltb8Q1nU  Ashley Doan (@AshleyMDoan) August 15, 2016The people of Louisiana also distributed immediate relief to their displaced neighbors much more efficiently than the government was able to. One of the best examples of this was the conversion of a movie studio into a shelter housing over 2,000 people. The Celtic Media Centre is one of Louisiana s premier film production studios located in Baton Rouge, which was one of the cities hardest hit by the flooding. The studio s executive director, Patrick Mulhearn, saw how devastated his neighbors were by the high water and decided to open up Celtic as an emergency shelter.There were smaller examples of churches opening themselves up, without prodding by either the Red Cross or the state government, as storm shelters for those who lost everything. Such shelters are all over the parishes that were flooded, and have largely been stocked with supplies by volunteers all over the state. People are even taking donations to the parking lots of stores that were unaffected to bring food, water, and other supplies to the flood zone.People looking to donate supplies have been coordinating their relief efforts on Facebook and other social media. If people are looking to donate supplies, they can use social media to find places to drop them off. If people in other parts of the state and out of state want to donate, they re being directed on social media to places where they can help.Even while the streets of Louisiana flooded, trucks from Wal-Mart and UPS did not stop rolling. Wal-Mart, in particular, was able to use its corporate meteorologists to plan delivery routes and shift deliveries of much-needed supplies such as baby formula and water to the affected areas. UPS is able to prioritize delivery of items such as mail order prescription drugs. Companies are rushing supplies into the disaster area quicker than lethargic government agencies and the Red Cross.Motivated by HistoryIn 2005, after Hurricane Katrina, Louisianians tried waiting on the government. That help never came and over 1,500 Louisianians died in the flood waters of New Orleans, St. Bernard Parish, Plaquemines Parish, and Jefferson Parish. The people of Louisiana learned the hard way that they had to rescue themselves.The people of Louisiana were motivated by a sense of community. While the Federal government was giving anti-discrimination lectures to flood victims, the Cajun Navy was rescuing people of all races. Louisiana has come together like never before.But it wasn t just the compassion of the people of Louisiana that saved lives. Companies which were seeking profit were also responsible. Everyone from the smartphone app developers to the retailers who provided the products to sustain and save lives played a role in this. Businesses and entrepreneurs meeting the needs of customers were literally lifesavers.For entire story: Kevin Boyd",politics,"Aug 23, 2016"

Trump should be excused from criticism for his repeated golf trips, McEnany reasoned, because Obama once golfed shortly after a journalist named Daniel Pearl was murdered by extremists in Pakistan.As anyone not currently trying to exploit his death to protect Trump might know, Pearl was murdered in 2002. Obama wouldn t become president for six years. And there is no evidence that he was golfing   as a then state senator   at the time.

He s now spent nearly every weekend in his first two months playing golf at courses he owns.Adding further absurdity to McEnany s defense of Trump, the president doesn t let national mourning stop his golf game.

23132,The Entire Mainstream Warmongering Media is Fake,"Jay Dyer 21st Century WireIf the Trump phenomena showed anything, it showed the consensus reality the mainstream media attempted to create concerning Hillary s certain victory, as well as the consensus reality erected for decades, is not omnipotent.In fact, the earliest days of mass print media were erected on a famous fraud known as the Great Moon Hoax  of 1835  something researcher Chris Kendall has long called attention to   wherein the  educated,   elite  widely accepted the mainstream publications  claim bat people inhabited the lunar surface.In our day, a similar hoax still reigns, as mainstream media is literally as credible as Weekly World News  Bat Boy story. Orson Wells as Citizen Kane (1941)Anyone who has seen Orson Welles Citizen Kane knows the director became a target of one of the most powerful media moguls of all time   William Randolph Hearst (who bought up all the major papers of his day). Not many years later, Skull and Bonesman  Baal,  aka, Henry Luce of Time Magazine fame and his CIA operative wife Claire Boothe would cooperate in promoting the  anti-establishment  hallucinogenic trend, along with the dozens of academic and government institutions associated with MK ULTRA.What was supposedly anti-establishment was in fact promoted by the mass media for the explicit purposes of cultural revolution and social engineering, as Dave McGowan has detailed in his Weird Scenes Inside the Canyon.The major television news companies, and CBS in particular, have their origins in operatives of the OSS, like William Paley and David Sarnoff, while the same goes for print media, as the CIA s tentacles extended to major publications, including Katherine Graham s Washington Post, the Bushes and the Moonies with the Washington Times, as well as the Mockingbird New York Times. Investigations into the CIA s Operation Mockingbird would reveal extensive media control through some 400 top editors and journalists, and even today known establishment and CIA operatives such as Anderson Cooper (CNN-CBS) and Robert Baer (CNN) regularly  report the facts  to millions of Americans.Journalist Robert Parry notes as a further example the mainstream, establishment press covering up numerous scandals for the Reagan Administration, including Nicaraguan drug trafficking and the infamous Iran-Contra: At least since the 1980s, The New York Times has misreported or glossed over many international issues that put the United States and its allies in a negative light.For instance, the Times not only missed the Nicaraguan Contra cocaine scandal, but actively covered up the Reagan administration s role in the wrongdoing through the 1980s and much of the 1990s.The Times lagged badly, too, on investigating the secret operations that became known as the Iran-Contra Affair. The Times  gullibility in the face of official denials was an obstacle for those of us digging into that constitutional crisis and other abuses by the Reagan administration. [For more on this topic, see Consortiumnews.com s  New York Times: Apologist for Power. ]In that same era, The Washington Post performed no better. Leonard Downie, its executive editor at the time of the Contra-cocaine scandal, has continued to reject the reality of Ronald Reagan s beloved Contras trafficking in cocaine despite the 1998 findings of CIA Inspector General Frederick Hitz that, in fact, many Contras were neck-deep in the cocaine trade and the Reagan administration covered up their criminality for geopolitical reasons. Rumsfeld and Saddam: Old BFFs.This scandal was not limited to the GOP covering its ass, but also the other wing of the decrepit vulture of our two party system when the Clintons were implicated in the CIA s drug importation to Mena, Arkansas, through the journalistic work of Gary Webb. The Telegraph explains: Webb summed up the heart of his Dark Alliance series thus:  It is one of the most bizarre alliances in modern history. The union of a U.S. backed army attempting to overthrow a revolutionary socialist government and the uzi-toting  gangstas  of Compton and South-Central Los Angeles.Perhaps most damningly, Webb wrote that crack was virtually unobtainable in the city s black neighbourhoods before  members of the CIA s army  began supplying it at rock-bottom prices in the Eighties.  For the better part of a decade,  he wrote in the intro to the first piece in the trilogy,  a San Francisco Bay Area drug ring sold tonnes of cocaine to the Crips and Bloods street gangs of Los Angeles, and funnelled millions in drug profits to a Latin American guerrilla army run by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. Given the mainstream media is almost wholly owned by 6 conglomerates, we can begin to see how the coordination and control once considered a  conspiracy theory  is now made evident. In 1983, there were 50 and now it is roughly six, with NewsCorp owning the largest papers on three continents. That these facts sound like a  conspiracy theory  can only be presumed from a position of ignorance, especially given the full coordination and deception regarding the Trump   Clinton election of 2016, from rigged polls to Wikileaks revelations of 6o plus top media operatives directly promoting Hillary.When the mainstream media and the lying CIA claimed Saddam had  weapons of mass destruction,  it was promulgating fake news. The false claim subsequently led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Iraqis for a ridiculous war that aided U.S. and Israeli foreign policy. While the WMD claim is now known to be untrue, the chemical weapons Saddam previously possessed were admittedly given to him by the CIA. When Saddam gassed Iranians in the conflict that saw U.S. arming of both sides of that war, it was done by a man installed and trained by the CIA (Saddam himself). Foreign Policy explains: According to recently declassified CIA documents and interviews with former intelligence officials like Francona, the U.S. had firm evidence of Iraqi chemical attacks beginning in 1983. At the time, Iran was publicly alleging that illegal chemical attacks were carried out on its forces, and was building a case to present to the United Nations. But it lacked the evidence implicating Iraq, much of which was contained in top secret reports and memoranda sent to the most senior intelligence officials in the U.S. government. The CIA declined to comment for this story.It has been previously reported that the United States provided tactical intelligence to Iraq at the same time that officials suspected Hussein would use chemical weapons. But the CIA documents, which sat almost entirely unnoticed in a trove of declassified material at the National Archives in College Park, Md., combined with exclusive interviews with former intelligence officials, reveal new details about the depth of the United States  knowledge of how and when Iraq employed the deadly agents. They show that senior U.S. officials were being regularly informed about the scale of the nerve gas attacks. They are tantamount to an official American admission of complicity in some of the most gruesome chemical weapons attacks ever launched. And as for Saddam as a tool of the CIA, even the UPI reported, based on Miles Copeland, the following: In the mid-1980s, Miles Copeland, a veteran CIA operative, told UPI the CIA had enjoyed  close ties  with Qasim s ruling Baath Party, just as it had close connections with the intelligence service of Egyptian leader Gamel Abd Nassar. In a recent public statement, Roger Morris, a former National Security Council staffer in the 1970s, confirmed this claim, saying that the CIA had chosen the authoritarian and anti-communist Baath Party  as its instrument. Iraq wasn t the only war-based lie (all wars are a racket, as General Smedley Butler said) of note   the entire tale of 9/11 was never questioned by the mainstream media, but in fact propped by coordinated disinformation. Within minutes, the top media outlets were assuring the public  Osama bin Laden  was the culprit, and what do you know, like Saddam, he happened to be another CIA cut-out asset. Not only was this flimsy official conspiracy theory ludicrous, it was compounded with an equally laughable  raid, capture and execution,  that was not televised, photographed or known, apart from the mainstream media simply claiming it was so. The CIA director even admitted as much, adding the infamous  situation room  photo was staged. . Following 9/11, a paper thin cover for expansion into Afghanistan was proffered upon the American population, when Afghanistan had no connection to 9/11 or Iraq. Incoherent and contradictory accounts of who was the villain, where Osama s cartoonish base was and how this somehow related to Iraq was touted by W, while the media worked fully in tandem with this ridiculous foreign policy. Even more absurd, and confirming the tip of the iceberg Webb had uncovered, U.S. occupation of Afghanistan saw the exponential increase in opium production, with Fox even showing America s finest guarding the opium fields! None of this could have been achieved without a massive coordinating deception campaign by the mainstream media.  The  lies have not been as successful in Syria, but we can expect them to keep the staged nonsense rolling.Jay Dyer is the author of the new book, Esoteric Hollywood: Sex, Cults and Symbols in Film from Trine Day Publishers.

14675,Taxpayer Funded Left-Wing Church Organization Will BREAK LAW To Hide ILLEGAL ALIENS (2016 Democrat Voters) From Authorities,"This isn t just any church organization, this is a  church organization  that takes in $45 MILLION in taxpayer funds every year! Why do we give them so much money? Because they re bringing MOSTLY MUSLIM refugees into our country where they ll get housing, food, clothing, education and spending money with MORE of  OUR tax dollars. They ll also be fast-tracked to citizenship. What s the end goal? The fundamental transformation of America Ohio  peace and justice  groups getting ready to break the law and hide aliens from Obama illegal alien raids, click here.The recent Obama Administration order to round up illegal aliens (a tiny number!) and deport them is simply a ploy to fire up the No Borders movement, the Democrat base, in this all important election year.Church World Service will be hiding illegal aliens!Here is a story about the hard Left Church World Service, a federal refugee resettlement contractor, which uses $45 million of your dollars every year to change America by changing the people, is setting up hiding places throughout America where illegal aliens can be placed out of the reach of federal ICE agents.There should be a law, if you break federal immigration law, you lose your federal funding (come on wimps in Congress!).They want to resurrect the glory days (as they saw them) where churches broke the law and helped Central Americans get into America and then hid them until they could be spread out to towns across the US. It was called The Sanctuary Movement.***It is so apparent that this deportation order is part of a Democrat strategy, most likely cooked up in the White House, because (have you noticed!) no one blasts Obama personally (as they would if this were George Bush or Donald Trump).Religious groups and activists vowed Wednesday to offer refuge to illegal immigrants who are the targets of ongoing federal raids meant to combat a new wave of border-crossing from Central America.The announcement recalled the sanctuary movement of the 1980s that provided safe haven to several thousand people fleeing civil wars in El Salvador and Guatemala, with churches in Los Angeles, Chicago and other cities sometimes filled with people seeking asylum in the United States.At the start of the year, the Obama administration launched a large-scale effort targeting those who have already been ordered to leave the country. About 120 adults and children have been apprehended in raids in several states.Central American illegal aliens are NOT refugees. They do not fit the long-understood definition that a refugee or asylum seeker must prove they would be persecuted if they returned to their home country.Escaping poverty or run-of-the-mill crime is not persecution, but these NO Borders activists have been for years attempting to blur the definition. And, that is mostly because when someone is defined as a refugee all welfare goodies flow their way and they can then bring in the family they left behind. (Of course the WaPo isn t going to explain any of that to its readers!).The effort, which is expected to include several hundred more apprehensions, has drawn sharp criticism from those who advocate for undocumented immigrants. They argue that Central Americans who are entering the country illegally should be offered the same protections extended to Syrian refugees.Via: Refugee Resettlement WatchHere is the list of churches affiliated with the radical Church World Services group:Member CommunionsAfrican Methodist Episcopal Church African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church Alliance of Baptists American Baptist Churches USA Armenian Church of America (including Diocese of California) Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) Christian Methodist Episcopal Church Church of the Brethren Community of Christ The Coptic Orthodox Church in North America Ecumenical Catholic Communion The Episcopal Church Evangelical Lutheran Church in America Friends United Meeting Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America Hungarian Reformed Church in America International Council of Community Churches Korean Presbyterian Church in America Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church Mar Thoma Church Moravian Church in America National Baptist Convention of America National Baptist Convention, U.S.A., Inc.

2566, Trump Got Caught Doing Something REALLY CREEPY On Vacation In Florida (IMAGES),"Donald Trump s most recent secretive actions toward the press are raising a lot of eyebrows and concerns.While Trump is on taxpayer-paid golf vacation in Florida, the undeserving POTUS has made sure that no one will know what the hell he s up to. To symbolize just how transparent his administration is, Trump has blacked out all the windows of his  Winter White House  and banned the press from taking any pictures and keeping tabs on him.Here s what AP reported Jill Colvin saw in the press pool area:Here s another photo of this disturbing activity:PoliticusUSA obtained a White House pool report, which stated: The pool was escorted into the clubhouse after Trump and Abe were out of view and then led downstairs to a filing room, where we re told we ll be staying for awhile. The door and windows are covered with black plastic so we can t see out. Photographers were instructed not to take pictures on the grounds of a  private club. While reporters may not always be blessed with ideal conditions when covering the president, being stuck in a basement with blacked out windows is highly problematic. This couldn t possibly be any more shady. Basically, American taxpayers just sent Trump on a paid vacation, and he s literally hiding from them.This shouldn t really be a surprise, considering the fact that Trump has ditched his press pool a few times before and has expressed a distinct hatred for journalists and the press as a whole. However, what Trump is doing is highly unethical. When you run for the highest office in the country, you work for the American people now and your life is no longer private. What Trump is trying to do is keep American citizens in the dark, and it is beyond disturbing. This is not how presidents should act.Featured image via Drew Angerer / Getty Images",News,"February 11, 2017"
18769,SICK REASON Historic City With “Off the charts” Crime Rates Passes Disgusting Ordinance Putting Criminals Before Cops,"The Providence (RI) City Council voted Thursday to give first passage to the Community Safety Act, a far-reaching ordinance designed to curb profiling by the city s police but the odd benefits it gives to criminals and specifically gang members has many in law enforcement shaking their head.The council voted 12-0 to approve the ordinance as hundreds of supporters cheered.  Mayor Jorge Elorza has already said he intends to sign it into law.After reading the details of this ordinance, the only ones that will be cheering in a few months will be the criminals.While the politicians covered up the terrible provisions in this act by saying that it was simply designed to  curb profiling,  what was really inside it will create one of the most lawless cities this country knows.The violent crime rate in Providence is already 134% higher  than the state average and the passing of this ordinance will be the best thing that Rhode Island criminals have seen in some time.Developed by activist groups, the Community Safety Act is weighed heavily towards giving benefits to the criminal element.  If you don t believe us, just look at the official logo (above) of the Act.  It shows the police at the bottom, which is exactly where the politicians have placed them by passing this ordinance.No one in law enforcement will argue that racial profiling should not be eliminated but this Act uses that premise to handcuff law enforcement from simply doing their job.The international and extremely violent gang MS-13 that initiated in El Salvador and contains a large number of illegal immigrants here in the United States, has been thriving in Providence, RI for several years. This new  Safety Act  will go a long way in helping this gang, that uses many of the same practices as ISIS to grow and prosper in Providence:Here are some of the items that the future victims of Providence Crime need to be aware of:And of course, the ordinance ends with an entire page on how police will be prosecuted and sued for any violation of anything in the ordinance of which must goes far and beyond any case law or practice that any agency in this country is currently doing.  Actually, the piles of paperwork that the Act requires of a police officer after they stop someone is done in another city .Chicago.  Hasn t that worked out well there?Now there will be some that are not educated in the dynamics of what this ordinance will cause that say we oppose this because we want police to racially profile others.  That is ridiculous.  It is against the law for race to be the sole indicator on profiling and no one in the profession agrees with racial profiling but passing this ordinance because a small section prohibits racial profiling is like eating a salad with a milk shake.  Any of the benefits of the salad go away after you drink the 1000 calorie shake.Let us be clear.  The City of Providence is in deep trouble.  Their crime rate is already off the chart and this Act gives all of the rights to criminals and in an odd way, gang members?Via: LawOfficerJesse Waters takes a look at Providence, RI to help understand why the unemployment is so high.

If the average American is upset about Trump being in the White House, you can only imagine what Obama s former officials feel, having worked closely with a truly great man and leader. Today, former Obama official Chris Lu gave us a look at some major resistance to the new president.Lu was Obama s top liaison to federal departments and agencies, and clearly showed that he was fiercely loyal to the former POTUS. Trump made the mistake of asking the public what agencies he should cut   and it went horribly wrong thanks to Lu. Lu answered the question   by proposing that Trump s White House be eliminated!Trump was looking for a way to make the Federal government more efficient, effective, and accountable to you    and we can all agree that our government would be far more effective without Trump and his corrupt administration. Here s Lu s hilarious response to Trump:Lu wrote: The President seems more interested in visiting his own properties instead of fulfilling his constitutional duties. But if he wants to stay in office, he should disclose his tax returns, eliminate all conflicts of interest, and disclose who is visiting the White House. That s something we all could agree on.

9141,BIG MOUTH ROSIE O’DONNELL Could Be Heading To Prison After Taking Her Hate For President Trump Too Far,"Many are suggesting that the former comedian, turned militant, leftist activist, Rosie O Donnell needs to be treated by federal authorities like every other American when it comes to being held accountable for her actions. O Donnell broke the law when she offered to pay two Republican lawmakers for voting against Trump s tax cut bill on Twitter. Even offering this is illegal. You are not above the law but I guess you are since the Feds haven't been knocking on your door. with all these tweets you obviously are not joking.  Androgynous Priest (@AndrogynPriest) December 21, 2017After ex-comedian Rosie O Donnell s meltdown on Twitter before the Senate s big tax vote Tuesday night, President Donald Trump can reasonably direct federal authorities to lock her up   and even to  take some money out of her fat-ass pockets,  which he once infamously cited as a personal goal.Starting a few hours before the legislation passed, O Donnell tweeted:so how about this i promise to give 2 million dollars to senator susan collins and 2 million to senator jeff flakeif they vote NO NO I WILL NOT KILL AMERICANS FOR THE SUOER RICH DM me susan DM me jeff no shit 2 million casheach  ROSIE (@Rosie) December 20, 2017Even after another Twitter user, Louise Mensch, replied that O Donnell was irresponsibly advocating bribery, O Donnell doubled down.i disagree it is obvious there is a price corker had one collins tooflake almost brave he crawled out backwards2 million to any GOP senator who votes noon KILLING AMERICANS MILLIONS WITH OUT HEALTH CARE MY GOD HAVE WE NO SO  ROSIE (@Rosie) December 20, 2017Federal law addresses O Donnell s actions.18 U.S. Code   201 criminalizes the attempted bribery of federal officials by whoever  directly or indirectly, corruptly gives, offers or promises anything of value to any public official   with intent to influence any official act. The penalty? For Rosie, she could spend up to 15 years in jail, suffer a lifetime ban from elective office and pay up to a cool $12 million:The statute calls for a fine of  not more than three times the monetary equivalent of the thing of value, whichever is greater, or imprisoned for not more than fifteen years, or both, and may be disqualified from holding any office of honor, trust, or profit under the United States. In court, O Donnell would probably argue that her attempted bribe was in jest, or perhaps a syndrome of a mental illness.After all, her attorneys would argue, who, while seriously attempting to bribe members of the U.S. Congress would do so in such a reckless, public manner that would all but ensure a conviction?

2717, WATCH: Congressman Invokes Impeachment Power On House Floor In Response To Trump’s Muslim Ban,"Donald Trump s executive order barring people from entering the United States from seven countries in the Middle East exposed his violation of the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution.And a House Democrat took him to task for it on Thursday during a speech on the House floor.When Trump signed the executive order last Friday, he targeted people traveling for nations that are not responsible for any deaths of American citizens on American soil, despite claiming that his order is meant to protect Americans from terrorists.Trump even invoked 9/11 to justify the order, but left countries off the list where many of the hijackers came from, such as Saudi Arabia, which also helped fund them and their operation.The nations Trump conveniently left off the list also have something else in common. They all have business ties with the Trump Organization.In other words, Trump is a complete hypocrite and is making foreign policy decisions based on whether they will hurt his family s business or not.And Wisconsin Rep. Mark Pocan absolutely hammered Trump for it on the House floor with a devastating speech. These countries were excluded from the executive order despite being home to many of the terrorists who carried out 9/11,  Pocan pointed out.  I m not saying we should ban people from these countries. I firmly oppose any ban based on nationality or religion. But it is unacceptable that business interests have played potentially a role in such a destructive policy, a policy that also makes our country less safe in the long run. Pocan explained that Trump s business interests in the countries left off the list influenced his decision to not include them even though Trump repeatedly declared that he would make America safe by blocking nations where terrorists come from to attack us. Trump clearly believes that maintaining his business interests are more important than banning travel from Saudi Arabia, the country where most of the 9/11 attackers were from and received their funding. It s time for the president to stop defending his divisive and unconstitutional executive order and start being transparent about his business interests,  Pocan said.  Every president in the modern era has released tax records to ensure the American people that their actions will not be impacted by financial holdings. Indeed, Richard Nixon was the first president to release his tax records to the public, and that set a precedent that all presidential candidates have followed over the decades. Trump broke that precedent and refused to release his taxes because he is hiding his numerous business connections with nations like Russia that would expose him and his treachery to the American people. Trump now says he won t release his taxes at all despite promising that he would do so after an audit is completed, even though an audit does not prevent someone from releasing their tax records.Pocan then demanded that Trump release his taxes, divest himself from his company, and repeal his executive order or else face legislative action, including the possibility of impeachment. Mr. President, it s time for you to fix this. One, divest your business holding immediately to remove any suggestion of conflicts in your decision making. Two, show us your tax returns so financial interests are transparent to the American people. And three, get rid of your unconstitutional executive order, which will make us less safe and only serve to embolden our enemies. Short of that, we ll have to take other actions, including legislative directives, resolutions of disapproval and even explore the power of impeachment. The Speaker then whined about Pocan threatening impeachment as if Republicans hadn t been calling for impeaching President Obama over the last eight years.Here s the video via YouTube.Donald Trump is a liar and a traitor who is putting his business interests ahead of the best interests of the American people. Not only should he be impeached, his entire administration should be removed. And Democrats could get the chance to do exactly that if Americans vote in 2018 to take the House away from the Republican majority.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"February 2, 2017"

6115, WATCH: Trump’s Campaign Manager Gets Brutally Called Out For This Pathetic Lie (VIDEO),"Donald Trump s campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, was grilled by Fox News  Chris Wallace over Trump s dismal polling numbers with women and Hispanic people.Trump, being the giant blowhard that he is, recently insulted the Republican governor of New Mexico, who happens to be a Hispanic woman. Not the best move to make if your goal is to take the White House in November.During the interview, Wallace asks Lewandowski about the matter: Corey, why on earth would the now Republican nominee since he s clinched the nomination, why would he call out the popular governor of a swing state like New Mexico who just happens to be the head of the Republicans Governor Association? Lewandowski evades the question, giving Wallace a stock  Trump s just being Trump  non-answer: Well, here s what happened, Chris, and you know this.  Every time Mr. Trump goes to speak somewhere, he lays out the problems with that given location, whether it s Ohio or Michigan, or Indiana, you know, your country is a mess right now. Wallace presses Lewandowski on the issue, playing a clip of Newt Gingrich where he states that Trump needs to do more to appeal to Latinos and women.That s when Lewandowski drops a lie that is so embarrassingly blatant, it should end his career. These are things that are said everywhere we go.  And so, you know, if Donald Trump is winning with Latinos, if you look at the last poll, he s winning with Hispanics.  If you look at the polls, he s doing very well with women.  He has a much more  Wallace cutsLewandowskii off to say: Corey, wait, he s not winning with women and he s not winning with Hispanics.  His numbers are hugely underwater with both. Ouch, that has got to sting. Wallace is telling the truth. Trump s polling numbers with both women and Hispanics (not surprisingly) are extremely low.

15959,Is North Korea’s Kim Jong-un Considering Using 70-Year Old Biplanes to Go Undetected By Modern Radar?,"What will he think of next? Is Kim Jong-un is preparing his special forces for suicide parachute missions across the border on 70-year-old Stalin era biplanes?Footage has emerged of North Korean paratroops jumping from the aged aircraft from very low levels in a show of force.The aircraft, which were designed in 1947, have an incredibly low radar profile   meaning they are difficult to track using conventional radar. They also fly at such a slow speed that modern anti-aircraft systems are programmed to ignore their limited returns.Also, the aircraft can hug the earth meaning ground-based missile systems will not pick them up and supersonic attack jets will find difficulty in detecting them from above. The bottom of the wings and the fuselage of Kim s fleet of aircraft have been painted blue with the top of the wings is green as a form of camouflage to prevent both ground troops and aircraft spotting them. According to The Drive, the aircraft could even land on short sections of road, allowing their troops to disembark and begin a sneak attack. It is feared the old aircraft could even deliver a nuclear bomb   possibly in a suicide attack into a strategically vital location. It is believed North Korea has at least 1,000 artillery pieces within striking range of Seoul, the South Korean capital, which is home to 25 million people. Kim has claimed North Korea now has technology to miniaturise its nuclear weapons to fit onto an ballistic missile. North Korea could potentially load a bomb onto the back of an An-2   with its one-tonne cargo capacity   and detonate it over the south. Read more: Daily Mail ",Government News,"Aug 28, 2017"
10948,BREAKING REPORT: ANTIFA THUGS PLACE BOUNTY On Head Of Black Patriot Defending Confederate Monuments [VIDEO],"The next time you hear someone talk about how it s a shame our country is so divided, make sure you tell them to thank a Democrat. We got a glimpse of the underbelly of the Democrat Party during the presidential election when the founder of Project Veritas James O Keefe went undercover to expose the Democrats plan to create chaos and violence and blame it on Trump supporters. The man in the video, Robert Creamer who bragged about his organizing skills had visited Obama s White House over 340 times. He is also the husband of a Democrat Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky of IL. Once the real riots got rolling in NYC and Chicago, and Antifa was gaining steam in Berkeley, CA, it was discovered that billionaire radical Democrat George Soros was actually paying to keep the riots going. So it really shouldn t come as any surprise that these basement dwellers have put a bounty on a black man s head simply for having a different political opinion than that of the one he was told he must follow Andrew Duncomb, aka  Black Rebel  has been an outspoken advocate of southern history, and specifically of the Confederate flag and Confederate monuments. We published an article about two great black patriots, the  Black Rebel  and Arlene Dunham, who have bravely stood in the face of hate and insults to defend for what their beliefs. But tonight, new information is coming out about a bounty that has been placed on the head of Duncomb, who according to friends in New Orleans, has gone into hiding.Here is  Black Rebel  telling viewers on his Facebook page about how they can t get any help or protection from police.

Sources told the Times that overseas leaders were briefed on how to handle Trump, making sure to take into account his huge ego and fragile feelings. They were told point-blank to give Trump compliments and praise, and not to expect him to attend long meetings.Peter Westmacott, a former British ambassador to the United States during President Obama s second term, gave reporters his take on the preparatory process with foreign leaders.In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally  Donald J.

1564, Trump Just FAILED Hundreds Of Manufacturing Workers And Blamed Obama For It,"Last year, Trump claimed he was succeeding at saving manufacturing jobs by making individual deals with individual companies, like Carrier in Indiana. At the time, people pointed out that he was boasting about the Carrier deal while totally ignoring another Indiana company, Rexnord, that was likewise shipping its jobs to Mexico.And now, Rexnord has done so. NBC News did a report on the plant s closure, which Trump must have watched because he felt the need to lay the blame for this on Obama shortly after it aired:Rexnord of Indiana made a deal during the Obama Administration to move to Mexico. Fired their employees. Tax product big that s sold in U.S.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 7, 2017The funny thing is that if he hadn t been bragging about how great he was at saving manufacturing jobs the instant he won the election, and threatening companies who were trying to outsource, he might actually have a case to make. But he promised to save these kinds of jobs and implied that he would do it company by company if he had to.All he did with Rexnord was tweet at them, which did nothing to sway their decision. And their employees feel as though Trump failed them. As one employee said: In the long run, he s done forgot about us  cause he s moved on to bigger and better things. Perhaps this little plant was just too little for Trump to bother with. The move will save Rexnord tens of millions of dollars, because they can pay Mexican workers $3 per hour vs. the $25 per hour they were paying their American workers. Regardless, this is what Trump said back in December, shortly after claiming victory with both Ford and Carrier:Rexnord of Indiana is moving to Mexico and rather viciously firing all of its 300 workers. This is happening all over our country. No more!  Donald J.

962, Conway Declares It ‘Unpatriotic’ To Question Trump’s Mental Health After His Latest Meltdown (VIDEO),"Trump has been on a 48-hour freak out with the hosts of MSNBC s  Morning Joe  and his clear incoherence has everyone from mental health experts to average Americans once again concerned that the president is seriously mentally ill. The evidence that our president is indeed mentally unfit for office is circumstantial but persuasive   and Trump keeps digging the hole deeper.Most people would agree that a man who can t stop himself from fabricating a rumor of a bleeding facelift to publicly attack the host of a cable show he doesn t like is unfit for office. In normal times, that alone would be grounds for invoking the 25th Amendment s clause on the president s mental capacity. For Trump, that s only the tip of the iceberg, the latest in a seemingly unending string of incidents that should raise serious concerns.The White House seems to be painfully aware that the questions swirling around his stability are undermining the credibility of his role as president. Consequently, and for the first time in U.S. history, the White House has to run with the narrative that you cannot question the president s mental health. Trump is sane because they say he is sane and shut up about it.Just hours after Trump got into a public fight with the hosts of  Morning Joe  on Twitter while he watched the show live, Kellyanne Conway went on ABC s  Good Morning America  to say it was unpatriotic to ever question whether Trump has lost his mind. Even while he continues to provide evidence that he has had some sort of mental breakdown.After summarizing an (incomplete) list of the things Trump has been called online, Kellyanne said: It doesn t help the American people to have a president covered in this light. I m sorry. It s neither productive nor patriotic. The toxicity is over the top. In short, Kellyanne wants us to believe Trump is the victim in all of this. Meanwhile, he continues to play the part of the bully.Worth remembering: Trump s favorite network, Fox News, once aired Glenn Beck claiming Obama hated white people. Its star anchor, Sean Hannity, repeatedly accused Obama of being a pathological  narcissist.  And its resident mental health  expert,  repeatedly diagnosed both Barack and Michelle Obama with various pathologies, including once saying Michelle needed to lose weight. None of that irrational hatred or vitriol caused Obama to live-tweet a rant about Fox News hosts or personally smear them on social media.But then, Obama wasn t mentally ill, so why would he?Featured image via YouTube",News,"June 30, 2017"

With new laws, more men like this can say they  identify  as a woman so they can get into locker rooms or bathrooms legally.  A man dressed as a woman was arrested in Virginia on Monday after police say he was caught peeping into restroom stalls three times in the past year. Richard Rodriguez, 30, filmed a woman in a bathroom stall at the Potomac Mills Mall, Prince William County Police said on Tuesday. A 35-year-old woman was in the stall when she saw a bag moved toward her under the stall divider. Rodriguez apparently had been filming her, police said. The victim rushed out of the stall to confront the man and saw him hurry to another stall, next to another woman. The victim alerted the woman and then contacted mall security of the shopping center on 2700 block of Potomac Mills Circle in Woodbridge, Virginia.Mall security detained Rodriguez until police arrived. Police then determined that he matches the description of a man who is accused of using a mirror to see into a women s restroom stall on May 15 at a nearby Walmart and also at the Potomac Mills Mall on Oct. 11. The suspect in the May 15 incident allegedly spied on a 53-year-old woman, police said.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella promised his employees that  we will go through this process in the most thoughtful and transparent way possible.  Analysts told USA Today that the number being let go was  larger than expected. The  vast majority  of employees will reportedly be notified  within the next six months  and  earn severance and job transition help in many locations.  Microsoft employs 125,000 people.Bill Gates, along with Sheldon Adelson and Warren Buffett, advocated removing  the worldwide cap on the number of visas that could be awarded to legal immigrants who had earned a graduate degree in science, technology, engineering or mathematics from an accredited institution of higher education in the United States. However, numerous nonpartisan scholars and studies have determined that there is a surplus   not a shortage   of American high-tech workers. Moreover, after a recent Census report found that  74% of those with a bachelor s degree in these subjects don t work in STEM (science, technology, engineering, math) jobs,  the mainstream media may finally be catching on and taking away the high-tech industry s  free pass.  CBS News, for instance, concluded that the Census data suggest the high-tech industry s contention that there is a shortage of American high-tech  is largely a myth. Ron Hira, a public policy professor at the Rochester Institute of Technology, has  said there are 50% more graduates than job openings in the STEM fields.  Microsoft s announcement hammers home his point that the IT sector has often been  an area of social mobility,  and removing the caps on high-tech guest-worker visas would take jobs away from American workers and make it more difficult to climb the economic ladder. You ve got people who come from working-class backgrounds who go into these sectors,  Hira said on a conference call of scholars earlier this year that Sen. Jeff Sessions'(R-AL) office organized.

Superman movie is not the only actor who should be shunned by moviegoers and fellow actors in the accepting, liberal, Hollywood crowd. It s time for the spotlight to be shined on a few of the other actors in the Weinstein movie, including  Justice League  actor Jeremy Irons.Actor Jeremy Irons, who won a  Best Actor  Academy Award for his role in  Reversal of Fortune , is set to play the role of Batman s butler, Alfred J. Pennyworthy in Weinstein s Batman sequel  Justice League . Given the pass Hollywood has clearly been giving sexual predators like Harvey Weinstein, Woody Allen, and Ben Affleck, it s not too surprising that Jeremy Irons has somehow managed to escape scrutiny by the media and by his fellow Hollywood actors after disgusting remarks he made following his role as a pedophile in the controversial  Lolita  movie.In 1998, Jeremy Irons starred as a pedophile in the movie Lolita, that was based on a 1955 novel written by Russian American novelist Vladimir Nabokov. The novel is notable for its controversial subject: the protagonist and unreliable narrator a middle-aged literature professor called Humbert Humbert is obsessed with the 12-year-old Dolores Haze, with whom he becomes sexually involved after he becomes her stepfather.  Lolita  is his private nickname for Dolores.Telegraph   The actor Jeremy Irons, who starred in the film Lolita, says the  hysteria  sweeping the country over pedophilia is damaging relations between adults and children.Irons, who has two sons with his wife Sinead Cusack, says it is important to uphold a rigid social morality but also vital that adults are allowed to show affection to children.Pedophilia should be treated as a disease, he says in a BBC interview to be screened next week. But it must also be recognized that children are attractive and that parental love has a  sexual  element. It is very difficult because children under 16 are immensely attractive,  he says.  Any father will tell you. I think our children have to be protected. But I don t think we need to have hysteria. In the interview, Irons says his character was not a pedophile in the strict sense, as he  knew that what he was doing was wrong . Referring to his family, he describes the difficulties of judging the line between natural affection and pedophilia. I remember when my son was 12 and he was like a god. He just went through that sort of golden time for about 18 months. I don t have a daughter but they do the same. Parental love is sexual. Children practice on their parents. Girls will flirt outrageously with their fathers because they are practicing. But we should know that that is practice. Boys will flirt outrageously with their mothers in a different way. His comments were seized on by child protection charities. The NSPCC said:  Such comments are ambiguous and could be interpreted by sex offenders as a justification for their behavior. Esther Rantzen, the chairman of ChildLine, said:  The words  immensely attractive  are not the best thing to say about children under 16.  Appealing or charming  are more appropriate. Irons, 56, made the remarks when asked about his portrayal of Humbert Humbert, the lecturer who falls for a young girl in the film of Vladimir Nabokov s novel Lolita. When the film came out in 1998, he suggested that child abuse did not always ruin the life of the victim.In the video below, Jeremy Irons arrogantly discusses his own brilliance as he portrays a pedophile in  Lolita . Go to the 7:50 mark to hear Irons tell the interviewers how  devastatingly attractive  many 15-year-old girls are. The greatness of the performance that Dominique Swain gives, is that she is all of our daughters. Funny, wacky, silly, attractive, because many girls of 15 are devastatingly attractive. WATCH:Irons also once posed the question about whether or not a son should be able to marry his father:NYDN -Academy Award-winning actor Jeremy Irons said Wednesday that while he doesn t have much of a strong opinion either way on same-sex marriage, he believes it poses interesting questions, including whether allowing same-sex marriage would open the door for interfamilial relationships. Could a father not marry his son?  Irons asked HuffPost Live host Josh Zepps. Irons argued that  it s not incest between men  because  incest is there to protect us from inbreeding, but men don t breed,  and wondered whether same-sex marriage might allow fathers to pass on their estates to their sons without being taxed.Jason Momoa who plays  Aquaman  in in Weinstein s  Justice League  movie was recently attacked on social media after a video was being circulated of him making a disgusting  joke  during a public forum, where he bragged about the benefit of being able to play  Khal Drogo  on the  Game of Thrones  series, and how he is able to  rape beautiful women and get away with it .

17455,(VIDEO) UN CLIMATE CHANGE FREAKS: “We should make every effort to decrease the world population”,"What an evil bunch of freaks! The agenda is so important to them that they can t see the forest for the trees. Overpopulation is a problem in itself but connecting it to the scam that is global warming is just crazy. These people have such a twisted view of everything that it s really scary. I m 100% FED Up! with the UN climate freaks and their agenda.Climate One founder Greg Dalton and the Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) Christiana Figueres, held a discussion in 2013 on the role of women in fighting Global Warming.During the interview Secretary Figueres stated, We should  make every effort,  to reduce the world s population in an effort to fight Climate Change:DALTON: A related issue is fertility rates in population. A lot of people in energy and environmental circles don t wanna go near that because it s politically charged. It s not their issue. But isn t it true that stopping the rise of the population would be one of the biggest levers and driving the rise of green house gases?FIGUERES: I mean we all know that we expect nine billion, right, by 2050. So, yes, obviously less people would exert less pressure on the natural resources.DALTON: So is nine billion a forgone conclusion? That s like baked in, done, no way to change that?HERE S THE VIDEO-IF YOU WANT TO SKIP THE BS THEN JUST GO TO THE 4:20 MARK: A LITTLE MORE ON CHRISTIANA FIGUERES-THE 70 S CALLED AND THEY WANT THEIR RADICAL HIPPIE BACK! AT THE 2:40 MARK SHE SAYS WE NEED A  TRANSFORMATION  (SOUND FAMILIAR) AND A  REVOLUTION  TO CHANGE OUR WAY OF LIFE: FIGUERES: Well there again, there is pressure in the system to go toward that; we can definitely change those, right? We can definitely change those numbers and really should make every effort to change those numbers because we are already, today, already exceeding the planet s planetary carrying capacity, today. To say nothing of adding more population that is really going to overextend our capacity. So yes we should do everything possible. But we cannot fall into the very simplistic opinion of saying just by curtailing population then we ve solved the problem.

2166, WATCH: Sean Spicer Just Made Trump’s Wiretap Accusation Look Like The Lie That It Is,"For a week now, the world has been up in arms about Trump accusing former President Obama of wiretapping his tower to spy on his White House campaign. The House Intelligence Committee has demanded Trump turn over any and all evidence he s got that supports that accusation, and there s also the possibility that he s committed obstruction of justice just by tweeting about it.So, of course, the White House press corps was asking Sean Spicer about all of this during today s press briefing. He said: The president made very clear in his tweet that it was  wiretapping. Those quotation marks above aren t an accident. Watch what he did below:Basically, Spicer stood at the podium in the White House press room, in front of the press corps, and put air quotes around the word  wiretapping.  Air quotes tend to serve the same purpose as scare quotes in writing   they re used to create doubt around a word or phrase. Spicer just put doubt around Trump s accusation of wiretaps. Literally.Now, it s entirely possible that Spicer just thought he was placing emphasis on  wiretapping,  or that he s just clueless enough not to know what air quotes like that imply. But it doesn t matter what he thought he was doing. It matters what he did, and he just cemented the doubt surrounding Trump s wiretap accusation.Featured image by Mark Wilson via Getty Images",News,"March 13, 2017"
2065," Lindsey Graham Just Went ROGUE, Threatened To IMPEACH Trump (VIDEO)","We re only two months into Trump s failing presidency, and even the Republican Party wants nothing more than to see the end of it. What s even more surprising, is that many of the party s most prominent members are doing very little to hide their feelings and disappointment.Earlier today, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) took the opportunity to grill Trump s Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch during his confirmation hearing. Graham has been a major critic of Trump since his presidential campaign, and he made sure to insult Trump on his stance on torture practices while questioning Gorsuch. Sending a warning to Trump about his stance on waterboarding in particular, Graham said to Gorsuch: You have said several times he is not above the law. So if we have laws on the book that prevent waterboarding  do you agree with me that the Detainee Treatment Act prevents waterboarding? Under the Detainee Treatment Act, waterboarding is illegal   and yet, Trump has blatantly stated during his campaign that he doesn t believe waterboarding is a torture method. He has previously said in several different interviews that waterboarding  absolutely  works and claims it is  just short of torture. Graham then followed his question to Gorsuch up with this statement, which sounded much like a promise and a threat to Trump: In case President Trump is watching   if you start waterboarding, you may be impeached. Gorsuch s response made it perfectly clear that he was in agreement with Graham. He said: Senator, the impeachment power belongs to this body. No man is above the law. You can watch Graham send this shocking message to Trump below:There have never been more reasons to impeach a president, and now even Republicans are beginning to recognize that this man does not belong in the White House.Featured image via screenshot",News,"March 21, 2017"

THE MONEY HAD ALREADY BEEN SPENT???The foundation s decision comes as politicians and philanthropic groups grapple with whether to return donations they have received from Weinstein, after numerous women stepped forward this month to accuse the movie mogul of sexual assault, harassment and rape.HILLARY LIES AGAIN:The Clinton Foundation faced questions about Weinstein s funding after Hillary Clinton said last week she would re-gift his campaign donations to charity.

The explanation comes after foundation board member Chelsea Clinton ducked questions about Weinstein s money from a DailyMail.com reporter while attending a Clinton Global Initiative University event at Northeastern University in Boston on Saturday.The former first daughter hustled out a side door after the event, evading a reporter as she rushed to her car surrounded by aides and security.The Clinton Foundation and a spokesperson for Hillary Clinton had previously declined to comment on the Weinstein matter.Organizations have been divided on whether to return money to Weinstein, who gave to numerous political and philanthropic causes over the years.Read more: Daily Mail",politics,"Oct 15, 2017"

A lot of Nazis were identified following the violent protest in which Heather Heyer was murdered and left 19 others injured after another one of Trump s  very fine people  used his car as a weapon to mow down anti-racist protesters.Trump has repeatedly blamed  both sides  for the attack. Democrats and Republicans both condemned Trump s remarks.Last night, there was another torch rally in Charlottesville featuring human punching bag Richard Spencer. Videos and pictures are being circulated on social media. Although only about 30 Nazis showed up to intimidate the city again, they might suffer consequences for their actions, if identified. It s 2017, and we re witnessing Nazis storming down our streets and obviously, these Trump supporters aren t nice-time Nazis who use Hello Kitty computers.Like, for example, James Alex Fields, the 20-year-old Ohio man who was arrested on the day of the rally and charged with second-degree murder, among other counts, after driving a car into the crowd of anti-racists, killing Ms. Heyer. But Trump won t call it  terrorism  because they are his  very fine people. Mothersbaugh needs a new t-shirt which reads,  God, Guns, Trump, Prison. Image via Twitter. ",News,"October 8, 2017"

2602, Donald Trump Has Become So Toxic That He Can’t Even Find People To Work For Him (DETAILS),"Since the coronation inauguration of Donald Trump, his administration has been so scandal ridden and so petulant that he s scaring even Washington s most power hungry from climbing the political ladder. He s desperately trying to find a Joseph Goebbels communications director and he s having no luck whatsoever finding someone to peddle his lies.Trump s Chief of Staff, Reince Priebus is temporarily filling the position of communications director, and frankly, with Steve Bannon doing the job of shadow government chief of staff, he probably has the time, but still, Trump, like the people who held that office before him, needs to find his person and so far, at least two have turned him down flat. There is a list of candidates, but I can see why people aren t interested. It s a tough job,  said a senior administration official.Those difficulties are compounded by Trump s management style: The president is known to pit his senior aides against each other, creating rivalries and divisions among his staff that have already impacted the rollout of a major policy initiative. Steve Bannon and Stephen Miller, the president s chief strategist and senior adviser, managed to keep the president s executive order on immigration so closely held that it not only erroneously banned green-card holders from entering the country, but also left members of the Cabinet   responsible for defending the policy   scrambling to respond.Source: PoliticoNot to mention the fact that most of the communications to come out of the current White House are either completely unethical or completely untrue. That s not exactly something that most people feel comfortable adding to their CV.For Democrats and for sane Americans, this is a small sign but it s a significant one. Trump loves to compare the country to a business and well, if we re going with that comparison, Trump is the Ford Pinto of politics. If a person gets too close, their career goes up in flames. As people in Washington are distancing themselves from the toxic orange man, you ll begin to see Republicans in Congress do the same. It s already happening with Trump s Supreme Court nominee.Read more:Featured image via Pool/Getty Images",News,"February 9, 2017"

3674," Trump EXPLODES, Attacks Jill Stein Over ‘Ridiculous Recount’ That Could Change Election Results (TWEET)","Despite the fact that many election experts have been hoping that the 2016 election results would be examined, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton is being attacked by the Trump campaign for supporting the efforts of Green Party candidate Jill Stein to recount the votes in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.Earlier today, Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway unloaded on Clinton s campaign   but Trump couldn t just leave it at that. Shortly after Conway criticized the recount effort, Trump chimed in with a statement of his own. In Trump s response, he blamed Stein and the Green Party for their  ridiculous  recount  scam  and accused Stein of trying to profit from it. Trump said: The people have spoken and the election is over, and as Hillary Clinton herself said on election night, in addition to her conceding by congratulating me,  We must accept this result and then look to the future. It is important to point out that with the help of millions of voters across the country, we won 306 electoral votes on Election Day   the most of any Republican since 1988   and we carried nine of 13 battleground states, 30 of 50 states, and more than 2,600 counties nationwide   the most since President Ronald Reagan in 1984. This recount is just a way for Jill Stein, who received less than one percent of the vote overall and wasn t even on the ballot in many states, to fill her coffers with money, most of which she will never even spend on this ridiculous recount. All three states were won by large numbers of voters, especially Pennsylvania, which was won by more than 70,000 votes. This is a scam by the Green Party for an election that has already been conceded, and the results of this election should be respected instead of being challenged and abused, which is exactly what Jill Stein is doing. Trump is right that Clinton conceded the election, but she s not legally bound to that   and it s especially insane that Trump would use her concession as part of his argument because he once said he wouldn t concede. Another glaring mistake in Trump s argument is his  the people have spoken  statement, which is hilarious considering Clinton won the popular vote by a landslide, as The Atlantic s David Frum pointed out:TwitterIn Wisconsin, there have already been four precincts that were reported to have discrepancies. Trump and his team are not hiding their anxiety over this issue very well, and they have every reason to be worried.Featured image via Win McNamee and Ty Wright / Getty Images",News,"November 26, 2016"

2690, Trump Goes On UNHINGED Early Morning Twitter Tirade; Attacks Federal Judge Over Muslim Ban,"One of Donald Trump s most controversial campaign promises was his  total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.  Now that the power of the presidency is his, Trump tried to do just that last weekend. However, the executive order that enacted the Muslim ban was poorly rolled out, bypassed scrutiny by the agencies charged with enforcing it, and caused protests to erupt nationally and internationally. Further, everyone saw it for what it was: the unconstitutional religious test for entering the United States that Trump had promised on the campaign trail.After a slew of judges struck down parts of the ban, one federal judge, appointed by President George W. Bush, James Robart of Seattle, struck the whole discriminatory policy down. Of course, this didn t sit well with Trump, and he did as he always done with confronted with any sort of criticism or challenge whatsoever, and went on an absolutely crazy Twitter tirade against Judge Robart early Saturday morning. Here are Trump s latest nutty tweets:When a country is no longer able to say who can, and who cannot , come in & out, especially for reasons of safety &.security   big trouble!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2017Interesting that certain Middle-Eastern countries agree with the ban. They know if certain people are allowed in it's death & destruction!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2017The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2017Of course, Trump s claims that other countries agree with his ban are patently false. There are protests around the world regarding his bigoted and un-American policies and rhetoric. He has only been in office for two weeks, and has already diminished America s standing in the world greatly by trying to whitewash America and shut out immigrants.Though entirely predictable, Trump s reaction here is highly problematic. He is clearly unraveling at the protests and criticisms against him, and having actual judges rule against him is just too much. What will be really interesting to see is whether or not Trump tries to see how he can remove this judge, just as he did with the Acting Attorney General who said that his Muslim ban was indefensible in court.This man is a literal fascist, America, and we are witnessing his slow destruction of our democracy as we speak. #RESIST.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,"February 4, 2017"
16996,UNREAL! Michelle Obama Gets $70 Million For Program To Empower Girls BUT Not American Girls,"Unreal! Mooch gets millions for Pakistani girls? The American taxpayers should be outraged by this! Let Pakistan empower its own people! Michelle Obama has been traveling all over the world with the Let Girls Learn initiative as her pet project. The only thing is that most of the places she s traveled to have a great track record with educating girls. It s just one big around the world vacation for Mooch compliments of the American taxpayer. Judicial Watch s Tom Fitton had this to say about the trip: The Obama family continues to bill the taxpayers for costly tourism jaunts thinly disguised as humanitarian crusades EUROPEAN VACATION: MOOCH RUNS UP A HUGE TAB COMPLIMENTS OF THE TAXPAYERS Could someone please remind this woman that America is BROKE! As public schools around the United States suffer through a perpetual financial crisis, the Obama administration commits a breathtaking $70 million to help educate girls in a terrorist nation known as Al Qaeda headquarters. It s part of the First Lady s initiative (Let Girls Learn) to educate and empower an estimated 62 million girls in third-world countries who are not in school. A noble cause indeed, but it s costing American taxpayers huge sums while kids especially minorities in this country struggle in schools that aren t adequately funded, according to public education advocates.  We know that countries with more girls in secondary school tend to have lower maternal mortality rates, lower infant mortality rates, lower rates of HIV/AIDS, and better child nutrition,  according to the initiative s website.  But too often, a girl who could change her world for the better is locked out of that future by the circumstances of her birth or the customs of her community.  So it s Uncle Sam to the rescue. The government of Pakistan, which is included in the State Department s Country Reports on Terrorism, will get the $70 million to promote education among 200,000 girls and young women age 10-19. The announcement was initially made during a White House event this month with the wife and daughter of Pakistan s Prime Minister, Nawaz Sharif. The program will serve as a platform and catalyst for broader political and social commitment to strengthen girls  education and empowerment in Pakistan, according to a government announcement.  Young women in Pakistan face barriers and lack of access to education opportunities from an early age due to poverty, cultural norms, and geographic isolation,  the announcement states. The question remains; should American tax dollars go to this foreign education cause when public schools in this country have been hurting for years? Besides financial troubles, there s an epidemic of low-performing schools and dismal graduation rates around the country, especially in the nation s inner cities. They could probably use a few million to create programs that might help improve academic performance or perhaps empower needy students like the multi-million-dollar allocation is predicted to help empower girls in Pakistan. The public school district in the Obamas  own hometown of Chicago could use some extra cash. By Thanksgiving as many as 5,000 teachers could be laid off unless the 367,499-student district Chicago Public Schools gets a $500 million bailout from the state. A recent editorial in the area s mainstream newspaper says that it  has been a disastrous time for Chicago Public Schools.  The piece is accompanied by an illustration of a yellow school bus with  Corruption & Politics in our Schools  plastered across the side. Districts across the nation are in similar situations. In Detroit, Michigan the public school system has a $515 million debt and among the nation s worst performing students. Read more: Judicial Watch",Government News,"Oct 28, 2015"

6189, Democrats Preparing A Coup To Oust Debbie Wasserman-Schultz,"As the Democratic Primary wraps up and tensions continue to flare, Capitol Hill Democrats are quietly discussing a possible coup to oust DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman-Schultz.Wasserman-Schultz, who has been seen as wildly divisive in the primary, is facing a mountain of criticism and uphill battles as she braces for a tough primary fight in Florida.According to an exclusive, in depth report from The Hill, Democratic Senators have been meeting together to draw up a plan to force the Florida Congresswoman to resign. One Democratic Senator, who is pro-Clinton and who remained anonymous, told The Hill: There have been a lot of meetings over the past 48 hours about what color plate do we deliver Debbie Wasserman-Schultz s head on. I don t see how she can continue to the election. How can she open the convention? Sanders supporters would go nuts. It s worth noting that these Democratic lawmakers couldn t actually oust Wasserman-Schultz; only the National Committee could do that, and would rely on talks between Clinton and Sanders.Another Democratic Senator echoed these sentiments, saying if the party hopes to attract young people, Wasserman-Schultz must go: We need to get this figured out and come together. Hillary s got the nomination. She needs Bernie s energy. It s time for her to accommodate. It s time to pick hard-nosed people to cut through things and figure out a deal. They [young people] need to know this is their party. However, not all Democratic Senators are cooling to Wasserman-Schultz. Senator Barbara Mikulski, who is retiring at the end of this term, said the Congresswoman has done a good job,  and said,  If you look at her platform committee appointments, she really gave a lot of room to Bernie supporters. Senators Bill Nelson, Tim Kaine, Kirsten Gillibrand, Jeanne Shaheen, and others have gone on record with The Hill vehemently denying the attempted coup and pledging their support. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and House Democratic Chair Xavier Baccara have also expressed their support for the DNC Chairwoman.The only member of he Senate to endorse Sanders, Jeff Merkley of Oregon, has remained neutral, but chastised Wasserman-Schultz for  adding gasoline to the fire  after the contentious and disastrous Nevada convention.An aide to Joe Biden told The Hill that the Vice President supports her.The issue surrounding Debbie Wasserman-Schultz continues to divide Democrats with roughly two months to go until the national convention in Philadelphia.Featured image via Andrew Burton/Getty Images",News,"May 25, 2016"
6082, Former CIA Director Says Trump Is Actually HELPING ISIS – Here’s How,"Donald Trump s idiotic followers may believe that Trump is going to eradicate the Islamic State, especially considering the fact that he threatens to  bomb the sh*t  out of them every chance he gets, but quite the opposite is actually happening. According to former CIA director Michael Hayden, who was also the head of the NSA, Trump s anti-Muslim rhetoric is probably helping the terror group instead. In a recent interview with the Guardian, Hayden explained that  the jihadist narrative is that there is undying enmity between Islam and the modern world. When Trump says they all hate us, he s using their narrative. He s feeding their recruitment video. Hayden is correct, no one has slammed Muslims more than The Donald. No once can forget his comments in December, which came a few days after a terrorist shooting in San Bernardino, California. Trump s reaction to the Muslim shooters  attack was: Until we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses, our country cannot be the victims of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in jihad, and have no sense of reason or respect for human life. Islam is a religion of 1.6 billion people and Trump threatened to ban every single one of them from entering the United States. If that s not a major motivator for terrorists to attack America, I m not sure what is. Even after Trump s horrific anti-Muslim comments, the xenophobia didn t stop. In fact, it was just the beginning. Trump s anti-Muslim rhetoric has inspired violence and harassment toward Muslims all over the United States   for example, people wearing hijabs are being called  terrorist  or are being physically attacked for no reason other than their religion. It s not a coincidence that these attacks were all performed by Trump supporters. Hayden isn t the only one to recently suggest that Trump s anti-Islamic rhetoric is actually a good thing for the terrorist group. Just a few days ago, New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman said that the Islamic State would love it if Donald Trump got elected. Friedman said: They would want someone who they think would do something more extreme than the other, push America back in the Middle East, and therefore inflame the situation in a way that ISIS thinks would benefit them.

7914," President Obama Announces The Major, Unfulfilled Promise He Will Deliver Before Leaving Office (VIDEO)","President Obama delivered an address from the White House on Tuesday to announce a major, unfulfilled campaign pledge which he is going to spend his final months in the White House delivering. He is going to close Guantanamo Bay.There is not doubt that Guantanamo has become a stain on the American flag, and a matter of national shame. As Obama put it: Our closest allies raise it with me continuously.  The creation of an extra-judicial prison, in which human beings are trapped and tortured, outside of all laws covering nations and war is a chapter of U.S. history that every American should relish closing. This should not be a partisan issue. It should be a matter of conscience. If America is to pride itself as a nation of laws, it cannot operate outside of those laws.Barack Obama s criticisms of the War on Terror and his commitment to close Guantanamo formed a central promise of his election to the White House in 2008. Sadly, many of the dreams remained unfulfilled. Drone strikes not only continued, but escalated. The U.S continued to intervene in matters of regime change, from Ukraine to Syria. This left the world with two possible conclusion to draw:Both those options left America, and the world, in a very uncertain era. Either, there is no politician we can trust to lead the nation in a just and honorable manner. Or, even if there is, that person will be unable to effect the change we seek. Both of these issue are a crisis for U.S. democracy and the international community.But Obama s announcement today could well signal shift in U.S. policy at home and abroad ahead of the next (likely Democrat) Presidency. In short, America could be refocussing on domestic policy at home, and good neighborliness oversees.The Pentagon has prepared a full proposal for shut-down, including 13 new sites on U.S. soil to house inmates that cannot be freed or returned to their nation of origin. But the Pentagon and the White House are keen that this is a plan that must be agreed and delivered across the aisles and branches of government. A press release from the Defense Department, stipulates that the plan  does not endorse a specific facility to house Guantanamo detainees who cannot be safely transferred to other countries at this time. The administration seeks an active dialogue with Congress on this issue and looks forward to working with Congress to identify the most appropriate location as soon as possible. In concluding his hour-long review of the plans, and President was unambiguous in his views, stating simply: This plan has my full support. The Pentagon is behind the plan, the President is behind the plan. If Guantanamo Bay is not closed by the time Obama leaves the White House, America and the world will know where the real barrier to progress on this issue resides   with Republican Senators and Congressmen. They are the only ones who stand in the way of putting America back on the right side of history.You can see the President s full address below:Featured image via Flickr Creative Commons",News,"February 23, 2016"
9362,"WATCH: ABUSIVE, TRUMP-HATING Student May Be Facing Jail Time, After STEALING Trump Hat Off Student’s Head and DEMANDING College Officials Prevent Him From Wearing It On Campus","On September 27, 2017, an unhinged, liberal, Trump-hating student, who has now been identified as Edith Macias, was captured on what has now become a viral video. In the video, Macias can be seen ranting and screaming, during an unbelievable exchange that took place in a campus office building at the University of California, Riverside, only moments after she stole a hat off  the head of Matthew Vitale, a UC Riverside student who was walking on the campus, and minding his own business. The exchange between this Hispanic woman, (who we re pretty sure is not a legal citizen, based on her comment to the victim, when she screamed,  F*ck your laws!  after he cited his right to free-speech) and the victim is stunning. Over and over again, this ill-informed and unbelievably angry student makes up her own facts with absolutely no basis whatsoever. Saying things like the signature Trump hat that reads  Make America Great Again  represents  the genocide of a bunch of people  and  America was never great  and of but of course,  You stole this land!  Just another ungrateful immigrant who is likely one of Obama s  Dreamers. ***WARNING*** The video below will make your blood boil.According to Campus Reform, here s how the unbelievable exchange went down:A Trump-supporting student at the University of California, Riverside had his MAGA hat stolen by a peer who demanded that administrators refuse to allow him to continue to wear it.A video of the incident obtained by Campus Reform shows an enraged female student taking the hat to the school s Student Life Department as Matthew Vitale fruitlessly attempts to explain to the young woman that the hat is his property. I swear to God I could burn this sh*t. I swear to God I could burn this sh*t,  she continues as several staffers look on. Are you people not going to do anything? She is stealing my property,  Vitale pleads, though the altercation went on for several more minutes. We will need to return his property to him, but we can talk about  one university employee begins to explain before being abruptly cut off by the student thief. How about we talk about not letting him wear this sh*t on campus?  the thief retorts, while Vitale later tells a growing presence of administrators that  the fact that you people haven t gotten this back for me is sad and wrong. The altercation continued for several minutes until the hat was relinquished to an administrator who then returned it to Vitale, though not before his fellow student got in the last word. F*** your f***ing freedom of speech, boy. F***it. F*** it because your freedom of speech is literally killing a lot of people out there.According to the College Fix: The UC Riverside student who stole Vitale s Make America Great Again hat off his head and refused to give it back now faces steep legal consequences.A criminal complaint provided to The College Fix by the Riverside County District Attorney s Office states that Edith Macias has been charged with one misdemeanor count of grand theft for the September 27 incident.The next court date on the matter is slated for March, and the maximum penalty Macias faces if convicted as currently charged is one year in county jail, a spokesman for the DA s office told The Fix.The charge was filed after UC Riverside student Matthew Vitale, the student who had his Make America Great Again hat stolen from off his head, decided to press criminal theft charges against Macias.According to the declaration in support of an arrest warrant, Macias told the officer who responded to the incident that the reason she swiped the hat was because it represented  genocide of a bunch of people. She stated she wanted to burn the hat because of what it represented,  it states.In a statement to The College Fix on Monday, Vitale said he is gratified by the developments. I m very pleased that the DA decided to charge her, especially because I am skeptical that UCR student conduct did anything. I will be following up with the student conduct office to determine if anything was done,  Vitale said. In the meantime, I can t thank UCPD enough for actually taking this matter seriously. The detective and officers involved with this case were the epitome of professionalism,  he added.  If, as I suspect, UCR decided not to discipline her in some way this decision by the DA s office shows two things: First, that UCR does not protect and shows no respect for speech that does not conform to their ideology. Second, that, in this case, UCR chose not to discipline a person who committed a crime on campus against another student. After Vitale had requested charges be brought against Macias, he explained his motives to The College Fix:  I do want to send a message. I am not vindictive, I am not vengeful, but people, especially in my generation, need to realize you can t do things like this because you don t like what someone is saying or wearing. Knock, knock.Who s there?Karma ",politics,"Nov 24, 2017"
6845, Ted Cruz Used #ScienceFacts Hashtag And Instantly Became Laughingstock Of Scientific Community,"Sen. Ted Cruz, a man whose climate science expertise extends no further than his ability to hold his arm out a window to see if it s raining, tried to troll Democrats by proving climate change was wrong in a single tweet   and it backfired massively.A vehement denier of climate change who once claimed he was just like Galileo because both held unpopular opinions (*eyeroll*) and who accused the 97% of scientists who say climate change is real of being liars, Cruz caused considerable damage to America s scientific community while he was in the Senate. Now he is poised to be in the White House, where he could downright derail it.With those stakes in mind, over the weekend the Democratic Party s Twitter account took a dig at Cruz for brushing off the idea that carbon dioxide contributes to global warming.Yesterday Ted Cruz said that ""carbon dioxide isn't a pollutant."" Someone needs to go back to science class  pic.twitter.com/cTp3QBxa2X  The Democrats (@TheDemocrats) April 16, 2016Cruz, whose philosophy appears to be  Well if I m already in a hole, I may as well dig,  immediately fired back with of a tweet of his own.Dems kill jobs, ignore facts. CO2 is what every human breathes out; every plant, in turn,consumes CO2. #ScienceFacts https://t.co/0eESF2Oz08  Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) April 16, 2016To which the scientific community responded in unison:  You can t be that stupid, can you? Cruz may not be an avid reader, but even a quick google search can debunk his premise conclusively. In an article published in Scientific American in 2014 and aptly titled  The Worst Climate Pollution Is Carbon Dioxide , writer Gayathri Vaidyanathan walks us through the reasons why: as far as climate change goes, the gas that truly matters is carbon dioxide. Unlike its shorter-lived cousins, CO2 sticks around in the atmosphere for decades to centuries, wreaking climate havoc. It has become very clear that if you want to stabilize warming at any level, you have to start talking about phasing out CO2,  said Joeri Rogelj, a research scholar at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis and lead author of the study.  Reducing other climate pollution can help in different ways and for different things, but in climate stabilization terms, it s noise on the fact that you have to phase out CO2. Here s a simpler experiment Ted can do in his own home. Take a blanket. Put the blanket over your head. Breathe in and out. Notice how it starts to not feel great? Now imagine that on a planetary scale. Too much CO2 can be a disaster and it wouldn t be a great place to live.The always on point science writer for Slate, Phil Plait, tackled this exact climate denier myth just a few months ago on his blog. CO2, so the deniers say, is harmless because it s just what we breathe out, and isn t carbon what all life is based around? How can that be bad?This is nonsense, says Plait:This is a stunning statement. Like most denier talking points, there s a germ of truth to it the carbon in living tissue does come in large part from atmospheric CO2 but to say that means it can t be a pollutant is pretty silly.For example, our bodies produce formaldehyde naturally; it s a byproduct of the metabolic process. Yet the Center for Disease Control and Prevention classifies it as a pollutant. Why? Because too much of it under the wrong conditions is a bad thing.As ever, Cruz managed to be both wrong and smug at the same time. He s not just ignorant, he s proud of it.Why does this matter?As you may have noticed, last October was the hottest October ever recorded. So was November. So was December. So was January. So was February. So was March. Climate change isn t just theoretically possible, it s happening now and more quickly than many scientists ever dared worry it would. This means the time for action is already here. President Obama has done several key things to help America play catch up on the war against climate change. First he dumped tons of money into researching alternative energy and America is finally getting serious about solar and wind power. But perhaps most significantly of all, we are beginning to work with other countries around the world to globally combat the worst effects.This all goes away with Ted Cruz. A President Cruz not only doesn t believe climate change is worth fighting, he doesn t believe it exists. For four to eight years, America will rollback and dismantle the progress it has made at this crucial time. What this means for the future is the stuff of nightmares.But on the bright side, if our cities are flooded and our crops are failing at least President Cruz can provide us have plenty of good, healthy carbon.Featured image via Darren Hauck/Getty Images ",News,"April 17, 2016"

15297,BREAKING REPORT: CLINTON AND TWO AIDES BROKE NATIONAL SECURITY LAWS,"Hillary Clinton is trying to blame the State Department for her lawlessness but new information is coming out showing the destruction of evidence by two Clinton aides. Thank goodness for Judicial Watch and their effort to get to the bottom of this e-mail scandal. Hillary Clinton and two aides appear to have violated two national security laws by sending classified information on a private email server, according to a former Army counterintelligence agent and investigator for a public interest law group.Additionally, the two Clinton aides, Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills, disregarded a federal judge s order this month requiring both to make sworn statements to the court that all government documents in their possession will be returned to federal officials, said Chris Farrell, director of investigations for Judicial Watch, the law group. What we have is a secretary of state, the only cabinet official in our history, who established her own private email server   in an effort to avoid the normal protocols for unclassified and classified communications. It s an end run,  he said.Farrell, in a briefing on the Clinton email affair at the Judicial Watch offices, said supporters of Clinton have sought to portray the use of the private email system to send classified information as a minor administrative matter. It is not,  he said.  It is a national security crime, and should be a national security crime investigation,  he said, noting that Clinton created the private email server a week before she took up her duties at Foggy Bottom, indicating that she planned to avoid using official email that must be stored under federal rules.Two laws apply to the mishandling of classified data on unsecure networks, Farrell said.The first is 18 USC Sec. 1924, which outlaws the unauthorized removal and storage of classified information. Penalties can include fines and imprisonment for up to one year.That statute was used to prosecute retired Army General David Petraeus, a former CIA director who provided classified documents to his mistress and biographer, Paula Broadwell. Petraeus was sentenced to two years  probation and a $40,000 fine as part of a plea deal in March.A second federal statute that prosecutors could use to charge Clinton and her aides is 18 USC Sec. 793, a more serious felony statute Farrell described as a  hammer. That law covers national defense information and people who misuse it to injure the United States or benefit a foreign power.Those convicted of violating that law face fines and up to 10 years in prison.Farrell said he that as an Army counterintelligence officer, he has conducted investigations in the past that are similar to the Clinton email probe. He also worked at a special security officer who was in charge of SCIFs special facilities used for handling sensitive intelligence. When it comes the law on these, intent doesn t matter,  Farrell said. Mishandling top-secret information should bring down the full weight of the law on violators, he said.The Clinton email matter is a  serious national security crime issue,  Farrell said.  It s not two agencies fighting over classification after the fact. Judicial Watch currently has 18 lawsuits pending against the State Department seeking access to records under the Freedom of Information Act. THE CLINTON E-MAIL SCANDAL EXPLAINED IN 2 1/2 MINUTES: A hearing on one of the lawsuits is set for Thursday before Judge Emmet G. Sullivan of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, who recently ordered Clinton, Abedin, and Mills to make the sworn statements regarding federal documents in their possession.According to Farrell, only Clinton supplied the sworn statement that promised to return all government data and not destroy any records involved in the case. Abedin and Mills, however, did not and instead supplied the court with statements from their lawyers.Thursday s court hearing will be the latest turn in an unfolding security scandal involving the former secretary of state that has the potential to undermine her bid to win the Democratic presidential nomination.Via: WFB",politics,"Aug 20, 2015"

Just outside of the stadium, t-shirts were being sold with an image of Kaepernick with a rifle sight on him. The text on the t-shirt reads,  Wanted  and  Notorious Disgrace to America. Another t-shirt reads,  Shut Up And Stand Up!  along with the quarterback s last name spelled  Kaeperdick  and an image of him.Robert Klempko of MMQB tweeted,  Shirts with a rifle scope trained on Colin Kaepernick selling for $10 outside of Ralph Wilson stadium.

Robert Klemko (@RobertKlemko) October 16, 2016While conservatives consider Kaepernick s continued protest over racial inequality and oppression in the United States to be unpatriotic, they probably also think descending on Washington D.C. with t-shirts describing America s first black president as a scary black Kenyan is patriotic. I don t understand what s un-American about fighting for liberty and justice for everybody, for the equality this country says it stands for,  Kaepernick said after the game.  To me, I see it as very patriotic and American to uphold the United States to the standards that it says it lives by. But Kaepernick was not alone.

12146,BREAKING: LIBERAL HEADS WILL EXPLODE When They Find Out Which Cabinet Position Trump Just Offered This Badass Former TX Governor,"Trump s choice of pro-oil, pro-fracking, anti-big government, outspoken conservative and former Texas Governor Rick Perry for secretary of energy is sure to ruffle the feathers of leftists environmentalists not just in America, but around the world Rick Perry, President-elect Donald Trump s choice for Energy secretary, has close ties to the Texas oil industry and has corporate roles in two petroleum companies pushing to get government approval for the proposed 1,200-mile crude oil pipeline that has stoked mass protests in North Dakota.Perry s current roles as board director at Energy Transfer Partners LP and also at Sunoco Logistics Partners LP, which jointly developed the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline project, is a strong indicator of the pro-oil industry sentiment that will likely take root at the Energy Department under his oversight. Perry is close to Texas energy industry executives, and his political campaigns, including two aborted presidential campaigns, benefited substantially from their donations.Trump announced his choice of Perry in an early morning release Wednesday from Trump Tower in New York.He called Perry  one of the most successful governors in modern history, having led Texas through a sustained period of economic growth and prosperity by developing the state s energy resources and infrastructure, and making low-cost energy available to companies and families. It is a tremendous honor to be selected to serve as Secretary of Energy by President-elect Trump,  Perry said.  I am deeply humbled by his trust in me. Perry s close relations with energy executives and his long-time dependence on them for political contributions signal an abrupt change of course at the Energy Department. Perry is expected to welcome the four-state pipeline and similar projects, set an open-door policy for oil industry interests and possibly tear down the department altogether.  FOX 5As he said farewell to the Texas Legislature in January 2015, Rick Perry couldn t help but reflect on how energy technology and policy had transformed the state s landscape   and fueled its economy   during his record 14 years as governor. Today, horizontal slant drilling is tapping oil and gas fields unreachable just a few years ago,  he said, going on to scold New York for banning hydraulic fracturing.  In Texas, we have chosen jobs. We have chosen energy security, and we will one day end America s dependence on hostile sources of foreign energy. Although Texas  longest-serving governor was, perhaps unsurprisingly, pro-oil and gas during his tenure, he didn t simply nod to those iconic, staple fuels:  You can be proud that Texas produces more energy from wind turbines than all but five countries,  he said.Indeed, Perry, left a nuanced energy legacy   including overseeing booms in fossil fuels and renewables   during his time in Austin. (Texas is now the No. 1 U.S. producer of both natural gas and wind energy.) Now, he is poised to take his experience to Washington, where President-elect Donald Trump has chosen him as U.S. secretary of energy. The appointment would mark a full repair in Perry s relationship with Trump, whom he called  a cancer on conservatism  last year while the two men were in a crowded field for the Republican presidential nomination.If confirmed, Perry would become the third Texan to land that job, which involves overseeing energy research and policy with ramifications on the economy, environment and national security. And he would certainly bring different perspective and background to the role than his two predecessors   nuclear physicist Ernest Moniz and Physics Nobel laureate Steven Chu.Environmentalists and others question Perry s qualifications to lead the massive federal agency, particularly because he called for its elimination during his first unsuccessful presidential bid five years ago. While they concede that he championed renewables during his tenure, they also describe a more fervent support for traditional fossil fuels.   TX Tribune ",politics,"Dec 14, 2016"

20311,"SWITZERLAND’S NOT PLAYING GAMES With Muslim Immigrants: “If you reject our culture, we will reject your application for citizenship","Assimilate or go home In the latest move to deny citizenship to anyone who chooses not to assimilate with Swiss culture, authorities have rejected the naturalization application of two Muslim girls who refused to take required swimming lessons at school because boys would be present in the pool.The girls, ages 12 and 14, who live in the northern city of Basel, had applied for Swiss citizenship several months ago, but their request was denied, Swiss media reported Tuesday.The girls, whose names were not disclosed, said their religion prevents them from participating in compulsory swimming lessons with males in the pool at the same time. Their naturalization application was rejected because the sisters did not comply with the school curriculum, Basel authorities said. Whoever doesn t fulfill these conditions violates the law and therefore cannot be naturalized,  Stefan Wehrle, president of the naturalization committee, told TV station SRF on Tuesday.The case shows how those who don t follow Swiss rules and customs won t become citizens, even if they have lived in the country for a long time, are fluent in one of the national languages   German, French or Italian   and are gainfully employed.In April, members of an immigrant family in the Basel area were denied citizenship because they wore sweatpants around town and did not greet passersby   a sure sign that they were not sufficiently assimilated, the naturalization board claimed.Another recent case sparked widespread outrage in Switzerland when two Muslim brothers refused to shake hands with their female teacher, also citing religious restrictions. Shaking hands with a teacher is a common practice in Swiss schools.After that incident was widely publicized, authorities suspended the naturalization request from the boys  father, an imam at the Basel mosque.The swimming case involving the two girls is the first to deny naturalization applications for not complying with a school program, setting precedence for future cases, Wehrle said.This is not the first time Switzerland s Muslim community has stirred controversy over swimming lessons. In 2012, a family was fined $1,500 for forbidding their daughters to participate in swimming classes.The matter eventually ended up in the Supreme Court, which ruled that no dispensations from swimming lessons should be made on religious grounds.In Switzerland, unlike in the United States and many other countries, integration into society is more important for naturalization than knowledge of national history or politics. Candidates for citizenship must prove that they are well assimilated in their communities and respect local customs and traditions.  DC Watchdog  Via: Shoebat",left-news,"Jul 8, 2016"
11157,OOPS! DOCTOR DRAGGED Off United Airlines Flight Has Dark History [VIDEO],"Is it possible the  good  Dr. Dao was simply setting himself up to be the benefactor of a massive lawsuit against United Airlines?  You be the judge First underreported fact:Initially, United insinuated that flight 3411 was  overbooked.  However, United spokesman Jonathan Guerin told USA Today that was not the case. He said that all of the 70 seats on the plane were filled, but that didn t make it over capacity.Instead, a regional affiliate that was operating the flight   Republic Airlines   opted to move four of its passengers because four crew members were considered  must-ride passengers. Second underreported fact: The airline said its agents  were left with no choice  except to call Chicago Aviation Police to get Dao off of the flight. When they arrived, security officers were unable to get Dao to cooperate with their instructions and physically removed him through the aisle.In the scuffle, Dao s face struck an arm rest and his mouth became bloodied. A short time after officials got him off the plane, he returned to the cabin and ran to the back, holding onto an object and pled to let him go home.Is Dr. Dao playing to the crowd on the flight or is he truly traumatized after being physically removed from his seat?#flythefriendlyskies my husband was on that flight.

Anspach (@JayseDavid) April 10, 2017Here s some of the background on Dr. Dao, the passenger who was physically removed by airline cops from the United flight leaving from Chicago:The passenger hauled off a United flight is a lung doctor with a taste for gambling, a history of angry outbursts   and a conviction for trading narcotics prescriptions and cash for gay sex in motels.Dr. David Dao of Elizabethtown, Ky., confirmed Tuesday that he was the inadvertent star of a viral video stirring outrage around the globe and said he was undergoing hospital treatment in Chicago.In an interview from his bed, Dao, 69, told Louisville TV station WLKY that he wasn t feeling well.In 2003, Dao was charged with 98 counts of illegally prescribing and trafficking prescription painkillers such as hydrocodone, Oxycontin and Percocet. You can read the criminal complaint above, along with other documents related to the case and Dao s medical license.David Dao by Heavy on ScribdHe was a co-defendant in the case along with Brian D. Case, who was indicted on 33 felony drug charges.Dao was caught on surveillance video meeting patients and supplying them with painkillers, mainly hydrocodone.According to a criminal complaint on at least one occasion, Dao received $174 in exchange for the pills in an unlabeled bottle. From 2001-2003, Dao  unlawfully prescribed controlled substances  to patients, court documents said.The criminal complaint in the case went onto say that Dao would solicit homosexual relations with a male patient in exchange for a prescription for hydrocodone. The meetings occurred at motels and it was found that Dao had written out personal checks to the patient on more than one occasion.The patient was arrested at a Walgreens Pharmacy and brought in for an interview, where he confessed about his and Dao s relationship. The man was brought into police custody because he was calling the pharmacy to order prescriptions and saying that he was in fact Dao, picking up prescriptions under numerous aliases.Dao was eventually arrested by police at a hotel room in Jefferson County on July 25, 2003. The room was under surveillance by the Louisville Police Department and Dao was seen with the male patient without a shirt on and with his pants undone. The patient gave Dao money for a bottle of pills and police stormed the room to arrest him upon the exchange.Dao was officially charged with unlawful prescribing, trafficking in a controlled substance and complicity in obtaining drugs by fraud and deceit and pled not guilty to the charges.Some of those charges ended up being dismissed, but Dao was eventually convicted on six counts. He was found guilty of complicity in obtaining a controlled substance (hydrocodone) by fraud and sentenced to two years, eight months in prison, a sentence that was suspended, and was ordered to pay a $5,000 fine.  HeavyOn the day he was busted, Dao was secretly videotaped with Case in a Red Carpet Inn in Jefferson County, Ky.,  with his shirt off and his pants undone,  the records say.Dao was convicted after a trial and sentenced to five years  probation after the judge agreed to suspend a prison term of two-plus years recommended by the jury.He agreed to surrender his medical license in 2005, but had it provisionally reinstated in 2015 so he could work one day a week for another doctor in Elizabethtown.The licensing records also reveal how Dao was  the subject of many complaints  while working at Hardin Memorial Hospital.The Medical Executive Committee there  took a strong stance in 2002, and put [Dao] on a corrective action plan due to his disruptive behavior  and referred him  for evaluation and anger management,  the papers say.

22450,SPECTRE OF BENGHAZI: DOJ Drops Charges Against Alleged Arms Dealer of Libyan Weapons,"21st Century Wire says The US Department of Justice (DOJ) is dropping all charges against an arms dealer whose weapons made it into the hands of radical Libya militants.Early this week a motion was filed by the DOJ to drop charges against an American arms dealer named Marc Turi, according to federal court records obtained by Politico.Also according to Politico: The deal averts a trial that threatened to cast additional scrutiny on Hillary Clinton s private emails as Secretary of State, and to expose reported Central Intelligence Agency attempts to arm rebels fighting Libyan leader Moammar Qadhafi.   LIBYA FALLOUT    (Photo Illustration 21WIRE s Shawn Helton)In the book entitled Definitive Report by both Jack Murphy (Army Green Beret) and Brandon Webb (Navy SEAL), a close friend of Glen Doherty (one of the Americans killed during the Benghazi siege) it was revealed that Obama s former deputy NSA advisor and current CIA director, John Brennan had been directing covert black-ops in Libya as well as other parts in North Africa, prior to the siege that left four Americans dead at a compound in Benghazi.Brennan s covert operations were said to have  prompted retaliation  inside the compound in Libya   as former CIA director David Petraeus had been blackmailed into resignation by senior CIA officials.All of this information was preceded by a massive cover-up involving mainstream media, Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, Susan Rice and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, both of whom initially blamed the siege on a heavily propagandized YouTube film entitled,  The Innocence of Muslims.  This meme was spread on many major talk shows even though evidence failed to connect the film to the attack.In addition, the White House and President Barack Obama had many inconsistencies in their talking points about Benghazi, first labeling it a terror attack, then quickly shifting gears, denying that there were Al Qaeda operatives anywhere near the compound.US Ambassador Christopher Stevens was said to have helped manage a large gun-running operation from the  Special Mission Compound  in Benghazi, as he was also said to have helped ship guns to  al-Qaeda-linked opposition  to assist in the takedown of former dictator Moammar Gadhafi.In a Business Insider report from October of 2012, the Benghazi story dovetailed the growing proxy war in Syria: In March 2011 Stevens became the official U.S. liaison to the al-Qaeda-linked Libyan opposition, working directly with Abdelhakim Belhadj of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group   a group that has now disbanded, with some fighters reportedly participating in the attack that took Stevens  life.In November 2011 The Telegraph reported that Belhadj, acting as head of the Tripoli Military Council,  met with Free Syrian Army [FSA] leaders in Istanbul and on the border with Turkey  in an effort by the new Libyan government to provide money and weapons to the growing insurgency in Syria. As 21WIRE has previously reported in 2014,  It s worth noting here: like Libya s new militant governor of Tripoli, Abdel Hakim Belhadj, the Chechen terrorist group Kata ib Mohadzherin s leader Airat Vakhitov was also under US supervision for years  imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba circa 2002, after being captured by U.S. forces in Afghanistan. Both were Belhadj and Vakhitov were released by the Pentagon only to be repatriated in the field again   back into fighting regions to organise al Qaeda-type Islamist groups   both active in countries which the US and NATO have been actively vying for regime change   in Libya and Syria, respectively. You can draw your own conclusions here about what Guantanamo is in reality, a fact which was confirmed by thePenny Lane leaks regarding the recruitment of double agents out of Gitmo. Interestingly, in a NY Times article from December of 2012 entitled, U.S.-Approved Arms for Libya Rebels Fell Into Jihadis  Hands,  we see an acknowledgement of an arms shipment at the behest of the Obama administration under the watchful eye of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton   but the mainstream media appears to have provided cover for the White House and State Department by blaming Qatar for the weapons transfer to militants: The Obama administration secretly gave its blessing to arms shipments to Libyan rebels from Qatar last year, but American officials later grew alarmed as evidence grew that Qatar was turning some of the weapons over to Islamic militants, according to United States officials and foreign diplomats.No evidence has emerged linking the weapons provided by the Qataris during the uprising against Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi to the attack that killed four Americans at the United States diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, in September.But in the months before, the Obama administration clearly was worried about the consequences of its hidden hand in helping arm Libyan militants, concerns that have not previously been reported. The weapons and money from Qatar strengthened militant groups in Libya, allowing them to become a destabilizing force since the fall of the Qaddafi government. The spectre of Benghazi looms large when connecting the Middle Eastern dots over the past five years.More from Zero Hedge below   TRAIL OF BLOOD    Many questions about 2012 s Benghazi terror siege remain unanswered. (Image Source: foxnews)DOJ Drops Charges Against Arms Dealer Who  Threatened To Expose  Hillary Arming Islamic ExtremistsZero HedgeIn what would under other circumstances likely be a major media spectacle, Politico reported that the Obama administration is moving to dismiss charges against an arms dealer whom it had accused of selling weapons destined for Libyan rebels and who had threatened to expose Hillary Clinton s talks about arming anti-Qaddafi rebels.According to a motion filed in federal court in Phoenix, the DOJ on Monday filed a motion to drop the case against the arms dealer, an American named Marc Turi. One potential reason for the surprising move is that as Politico writes, the deal averts a trial that threatened to cast additional scrutiny on Hillary Clinton s private emails as Secretary of State, and to expose reported Central Intelligence Agency attempts to arm rebels fighting Libyan leader Moammar Qadhafi.Turi was indicted in 2014 on four felony counts: two of arms dealing in violation of the Arms Export Control Act and two of lying to the State Department in official applications. The charges accused Turi of claiming that the weapons involved were destined for Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, when the arms were actually intended to reach Libya. Turi s lawyers argued that the shipments were part of a U.S. government-authorized effort to arm Libyan rebels. It s unclear if any of the weapons made it to Libya, and there s no evidence linking weapons provided by the U.S. government to the Benghazi attacks.According to Politico government lawyers were facing a Wednesday deadline to produce documents to Turi s legal team, and the trial was officially set to begin on Election Day, although it likely would have been delayed by protracted disputes about classified information in the case. A Turi associate asserted that the government dropped the case because the proceedings could have embarrassed Clinton and President Barack Obama by calling attention to the reported role of their administration in supplying weapons that fell into the hands of Islamic extremist militants.Making matters worse, Turi s case had delved into emails sent to and from the controversial private account that Clinton used as Secretary of State, which the defense planned to harness at any trial. They don t want this stuff to come out because it will look really bad for Obama and Clinton just before the election,  said the associate.Leery of admitting the actual truth, in the dismissal motion, prosecutors were vague saying that  discovery rulings  from U.S. District Court Judge David Campbell contributed to the decision to drop the case. The joint motion asks the judge to accept a confidential agreement to resolve the case through a civil settlement between the State Department and the arms broker.This story continues at Zero Hedge READ MORE ISIS NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire ISIS Files   READ MORE LIBYA NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Libya FilesSUPPORT OUR WORK BY SUBSCRIBING & BECOMING A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",US_News,"October 5, 2016"
8190, This Company Uses A Black Model To Promote The Worst Shirt Ever (IMAGES/TWEETS),"Online retailer ASOS has come under fire for their horrible lack of judgment in having a black model wear a t-shirt that has the word  slave  on it in huge letters. For some reason, it never occurred to anyone in the process of approval that this might be considered extremely racist.The t-shirt, which is by the brand Wasted Heroes, was posted to ASOS  website and the internet basically blew up as soon as it was published. It didn t take long before there was enough backlash to encourage the company to remove the photo, as Twitter users reprimanded the company with an onslaught of complaints.Seriously, you have to be pretty dense in order to overlook how bad of an idea this t-shirt and photo was. But apparently, ASOS is fine with being ignorant   the company took zero responsibility for the offense, and instead blamed the manufacturer. A spokesperson for the company offered no apology and simply said: Marketplace is a collection of independent sellers [like Wasted Heroes] who must agree to our terms and conditions when they join. Whenever we find a product that violates our policies we remove it immediately. The company s response on social media was equally underwhelming, and pointed complaints to the manufacturer:Wasted Heroes didn t do much better, but they at least admitted that the decision was  extremely stupid of us. The company s weak attempt at an apology was overshadowed by the suggestion that shoppers had misinterpreted the shirt. When you go to Wasted Heroes  website, you can see the same t-shirt alongside other slave-themed merchandise   although the shirts are hanging from a bar and chains instead of people.One has to wonder how such monstrous mistakes go unnoticed and make it all the way to a company s website without one person raising a red flag. This is ASOS  second strike within the last few months   last October, the company was criticized for selling bindis in their site s Halloween section.There have been several instances of other retailers making similar racist or culturally clueless mistakes. In 2014, Zara had to remove a children s shirt because it bared resemblance to concentration camp uniforms. A few years before that, Adidas was forced to pull a pair of trainers before they even got to stores because the shoes included Velcro shackles, which caused outrage for being reminiscent of shackles worn by prisoners or slaves.Companies need to do better. There s no reason why something as racist, offensive and culturally inappropriate as these examples should make it all the way up the chain of commands and onto shelves or websites.

53," Trump’s Biggest KKK Fan Is Back, And He Just LOVED Those Anti-Muslim Tweets This Morning","Just in case you needed any more proof that Donald Trump s racist tweets were a thinly-coded message to his alt-right, anti-Muslim, and white supremacist followers, a former Grand Wizard of the KKK has jumped on board today in praise of President Hates-a-Lot.It wasn t enough that the KKK endorsed Trump during his campaign to stop his multitudes of followers from voting for him, so it s hard to say whether Duke s full-throated endorsement of today s disgusting display of racism will be any different. But for the average American, seeing the former Klan leader get behind Trump so vigorously should make them more than a little sick.To even go to Duke s page on Twitter is to subject yourself to a blinding cover photo, all white, with a blue-eyed  Aryan  baby in the upper corner, and the words  It s Okay To Be White  across the middle. The phrase is part of a hate campaign that  Doctor  Duke has been pushing across America, a play on the notion that there is some kind of war on white people happening.But the tweet itself is disturbing:Trump retweets video of crippled white kid in Europe being beaten by migrants, and white people being thrown off a roof and then beaten to death, He's condemned for showing us what the fake news media WON'T. Thank God for Trump! That's why we love him!  David Duke (@DrDavidDuke) November 29, 2017By invoking God in his message, Duke is trying the age-old tactic of pretending that white supremacy has its roots in Christianity, an angle that KKK members have tried to use for generations.Sadly, it works on some followers of both Duke s and of Donald Trump s. It seems there s quite a bit of crossover between the two racist groups. That s no surprise: The KKK were absolutely instrumental in getting Trump elected.The bottom line is, both men know exactly what they re doing when they send messages like that to their followers.

But continuing to leave them on his Twitter feed even after seeing praise from a Loyal White Knight like David Duke is just rubbing salt in the wound.Featured image via William Thomas Cain/Getty Images",News,"November 29, 2017"

Trump literally let Ivanka take his place at the G-20 Summit on Friday even though she is NOT in any position to represent America on the world stage.She is not an elected official, nor is she the Secretary of State. She doesn t even have diplomatic status. Yet Ivanka took her daddy s place at the round table meeting, sitting beside British Prime Minister Theresa May and Chinese President Xi Jinping.Here s a photo via Twitter.Ivanka Trump, unelected, unqualified, daughter-in-chief, is representing the US at the G20 summit next to May, Xi, Merkel.

A photo of Trump clearly being ignored as other leaders talk to each other while he sits by himself at the table has been widely circulated.agreed pic.twitter.com/BzFBhw7Y7S  Phil Jones (@Meercat42) July 8, 2017It s pretty damn clear that the other world leaders want nothing to do with Trump or Ivanka.Trump later praised Ivanka and claimed that she s only getting criticized because she s his daughter. If she weren t my daughter it would be so much easier for her,  Trump said.  It might be the only bad thing she has going if you want to know the truth. Trump s remarks received a mere golf clap from a few people in the room.Just imagine the reaction from Republicans if President Obama had let his daughter Malia take his place at the G-20 Summit. They would have been uncontrollably enraged. They would have called Obama irresponsible. They would have accused him of nepotism. They would have called him a dictator. But Trump lets his daughter take his place and Republicans don t say a word because they are hypocrites.America deserves to be represented by the president at the G-20. At the very least, a State Department official should have replaced Trump. Ivanka is only Trump s adviser because he ignored government ethics rules. She has no experience as a public official. She certainly has no experience in diplomacy.This only serves as yet another embarrassing Trump moment abroad that makes our country look like even more of a joke on the world stage.Featured Image: Twitter",News,"July 8, 2017"
5165, Trump Just Outed Himself As YUUUGE Liar After Saying He Saw U.S. Plane Unloading Money To Iran,"Oh, Donald Trump. The pathological liar has struck again, although everyone should have seen this coming. At a rally in Daytona Beach, he made an absurd claim that he saw  top secret  footage of a U.S. plane unloading $400 million in payment to Iran the same day that four American detainees were released. Of course, he later used Twitter to try and backpedal, but all he really did was admit that he lied through his teeth:The plane I saw on television was the hostage plane in Geneva, Switzerland, not the plane carrying $400 million in cash going to Iran!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 5, 2016The tape that he saw allegedly came from Iran, and he made it out to be some kind of taunt on their part: It was interesting because a tape was made. Right? You saw that? With the airplane coming in   nice plane   and the airplane coming in, and the money coming off, I guess. Right? That was given to us   has to be   by the Iranians. And you know why the tape was given to us? Because they want to embarrass our country. They want to embarrass our country. And they want to embarrass our president because we have a president who s incompetent. They want to embarrass our president.I mean, who would ever think they would be taking all of this money off the plane and then providing us with a tape? It s only for one reason. And it s very, very sad. Oddly enough for him, intelligence officials had zero idea what he was talking about, since no such video exists. There are two yuuuge problems with this:And he has the nerve to call Hillary  Crooked Hillary,  in part because of the right-wing narrative that she mishandled classified info. As president, he ll brag about every juicy thing he sees because it makes him feel important and superior to have access to info that others don t have. He can t wait to tell the world how much better he is than they are.On Wednesday, a spokesperson said that he d simply mistaken a grainy video of detainees being released, which played on Fox News, for this  to secret  video. However, Trump made this absurd claim again on Thursday, in Portland, Maine, as if the video was part of the intelligence briefings he s getting as a presidential candidate.Those briefings have not yet begun.As his story began developing holes, and then unraveling entirely, Trump decided he had to scramble in order to avoid looking like the liar of liars caught in a lie. His tweet is meant to make it look like he d just made a mistake. It s in line with what his spokesperson said, but, again, the timeline is way off.All he really did was say,  I lied about this, but it doesn t matter! Sorry not sorry!

7796," Iran Stuns World In First Election Since Nuclear Agreement, Pro-West Reformists Sweep Seats","Republicans may have done everything they could to destroy the Iran nuclear deal, including dabbling in light treason, but President Obama was just vindicated for sticking to his guns   and in a HUGE way.In the first election held in Iran in the aftermath of the landmark nuclear deal, the Iranian people flooded to the polls in record numbers to support the warming relations between the two countries. For anti-American hardliners in Tehran, this was a very bad day. According to the Washington Post:Iranian reformists appear have won all 30 seats representing the nation s capital in parliament, a definitive rebuke to the hard-liners opposing President Hassan Rouhani s efforts to increase economic openness and cooperate with the West.In the first elections held since last year s nuclear deal, none of Iran s three main political camps   reformists, conservatives and hard-liners   is expected to win an outright majority, but early results indicate the best reformist showing in the 290-seat parliament in more than a decade.It was also a bad day for anti-Iranian hardliners in America. For months, Republican lawmakers have been attempting to destroy the merits of this international agreement under the premise that Iran will not abide by its agreed upon terms and that the country will never reform. Both theories have now been refuted. The United Nations recently announced that Iran had successfully fulfilled its obligations towards dismantling its nuclear program. Now even the government seems to be changing in a direction towards diplomacy and building international relationships.Iran seems on the verge of a monumental change, perhaps for the first time in decades. Years of threats from America moved the country very little, but the cooling tensions has allowed Iranian moderates to push for greater economic and social reforms. As a sign of the changing times, it is reported that more women than ever before ran and were elected to office.Reporters are predicting as many as 20 women could win seats in #IranElections2016. Historic, record-breaking figure https://t.co/woiSkLluzu  Golnar Motevalli (@golnarM) February 28, 2016That does not mean to say that everything is perfect. The country still hosts a number of appalling human rights violations against its own people. It also doesn t quite love America. At this point, the two countries merely talking to each other is a pretty huge deal.But no one outside of the Republican Party ever thought demanding immediate and unconditional surrender would ever work. Instead, Obama s strategy has always been to  trust, but verify  that the agreements he and Secretary of State John Kerry were hammering out were being fulfilled. The stakes are high: Greater prosperity for the Iranian public and a lesser chance of all out war between the United States and one of the biggest countries in the Middle East.None of this is likely to silence Obama s worst critics. They are beyond the point of rational thought about Iran. The results of this cognitive dissonance can occasionally be quite humorous. Just a day before Iranians went to the polls, and at the risk of looking like a complete jackass, conservative writer Eli Lake penned an anti-nuclear agreement rant for Bloomberg that predicted moderates would get demolished. Alas, it didn t pan out that way. It was an unmitigated  Karl Rove moment  and one that should serve as a reminder for other would-be critics to at least wait for the polls to come back before thinking up new ways to attack the President s deal with Iran.Something tells me they won t listen.Featured image via Twitter ",News,"February 28, 2016"
23107,‘Common Cause’? Barbra Streisand lobbying Obama to bypass US Senate and appoint Supreme Court Justice unilaterally,"21st Century Wire says Three weeks ago, while the wounds were still fresh following Hillary Clinton s epic electoral collapse, a number of frustrated Hollywood celebrities floated various reactionary and often flippant ideas. As liberal elites and their student acolytes accused President-Elect Donald J. Trump of being a  fascist , Hollywood elites were themselves pushing actual fascist directives, the worst of which had to be singer Barbra Streisand s insistence that lame duck president Barack Obama bypass the US Senate and appoint a liberal Supreme Court Justice unilaterally. If this episode demonstrates anything, it shows how Hollywood s liberal celebrity elites would govern if, god forbid, they were ever in power.Streisand has been pushing via her Facebook page a White House petition entitled We the People calling for Obama to appoint Merrick Garland by executive action   and without any Senate confirmation or due process. Obama had previously nominated Garland, a chief justice of the U.S. District Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, to fill the seat of Justice Antonin Scalia, who died suddenly last winter. Underlining the current partisan feud during this election year, Senate Republicans refused to hold hearings or vote on his nomination.It appears that Streisand is working in coordination with a radical left-wing George Soros-funded  change agent  NGO called Common Cause, whose board member Gregory L. Diskant had initially worked with the Washington Post to launch their the campaign in the national media.Here s what the ever controversial pundit, the Doctor of Common Sense  E.T. Williams had this to say about Hollywood s attempted hostile takeover of the US Supreme Court, and celebrities who had threatened to leave the US if Trump won the election  ",Middle-east,"December 12, 2016"
6553, Donald Trump Isn’t Going To Like This Fox News Reaction To His Victory In The Primaries (VIDEO),"While the Trump campaign and its candidate celebrate the surrender of his final real competitor for the Republican nomination, there will be no pleasure about this incredible situation from Fox News.Charles Krauthammer, a Pulitzer prize winning conservative journalist, and long-term Trump critic appeared on the O Reilly Factor to pour a bucket of ice water over the celebration   telling O Reilly that a man of Trump s temperament has no place in the White House, or anywhere near the nuclear codes.The interview began with O Reilly asking Krauthammer to give his view on how the GOP establishment felt about Trump becoming the presumptive Republican nominee for President of the United States. His guest replied calmly: I have no idea what the so-called establishment, if it exists, is thinking. I can tell you what I m thinking.  And boy, he really did.O Reilly asks Krauthammer if he would vote for Trump, who responds that based on the campaign so far: I don t think I d be capable voting for Donald Trump. The Fox host then attempts to sell Krauthammer on Trump, as if all the racist, sexist, frat bro behavior from the candidate so far will all fade away once the race for President moves into it s next phase. Finally, after working up this fantasy version of Trump, he asks his guest why he wouldn t vote for Donald if he re-positioned himself as a practical-popular-conservative. Why couldn t you vote for him?  O Reilly asks, before Krauthammer delivers a killer deadpan response with: Populist conservative is a contradiction in terms. O Reilly takes his guest to task on the issue, claiming that he (O Reilly) is a traditional populist   to which Krauthammer replies that he wouldn t vote for Bill O Reilly for President either. And there s a second issue.  Krauthammer continues.  His fitness for office. It s matter of temperament and up until now he s not impressed me with his temperament. You have to ask yourself, do I want a person of that temperament, control of the nuclear codes. And as of now I have to say no. While O Reilly continues to run defense for the Trump campaign, his guest Krauthammer bangs the final nail into the coffin. He wins it by floating conspiracy theories that you know and I know are in the twilight zone. In the same way that he led the birther movement. That wasn t ancient history. That was five years ago. Playing with absurd and kooky conspiracy theories is way beyond being unconventional. It is disturbing. And that s when you gotta ask yourself. Do you want someone who does that, in control of the nuclear codes? It looks like Trump is going to be facing some blowback from conservatives who are sick of their party being hijacked by the lunatic fringe. It s great news for the Democrats and liberal America, as it means the 2016 election may well see the GOP tear itself apart   leaving the Democratic nominee to a landslide.Here s the video:Featured Image via Screengrab",News,"May 4, 2016"
17572,DEMOCRATS Get DEVASTATING News After Spending $10.1 MILLION To Defeat Roy Moore In AL Senate Race,"Roll Call   Democrat Doug Jones drastically outraised GOP nominee Roy Moore for the Alabama Senate race, new campaign finance documents show.Jones raised nearly six times Moore s amount ahead of the Dec. 12 special election to fill the Senate seat vacated by Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Jones headed into the final weeks of the race with roughly four times as much money in the bank than his GOP opponent. Jones raked in nearly $10.2 million compared to Jones  $1.8 million. Jones also spent roughly 5 times as much as Moore during that period, nearly $8.7 million compared to Moore s $1.7 million.The Democrat Party, who up until just recently, was essentially broke, just got some very bad news today from reliable media ally, CBS News.As the majority of Alabama Republicans believe that the allegations against Judge Roy Moore are untrue, he now takes a commanding lead over radical leftist Democrat Doug Jones per a new CBS News poll.The CBS News/YouGov poll, conducted between Nov. 28 and Dec. 1, surveyed 1,037 Alabamians registered to vote in Alabama. It further segmented the poll results into some results among registered voters and others among likely voters. Among registered voters, the margin of error is 3.8 percent. Among likely voters, the margin of error is 4.8 percent. The results of the election, with Moore leading Jones, were broken down to likely voters.Another part broken down to likely voters was polling specifically about the allegations about Moore. Perhaps unsurprisingly, a significant number of Alabamians do not believe the allegations against Moore one bit.  Breitbart Despite all of the money Democrats have poured into the race, Alabama voters are not buying the media reports that decades ago, several women were victims of Republican Senate candidate Judge Roy Moore, who they are now accusing of being a sexual predator. After many of the women s claims were called into question, including the claim made by Beverly Young-Nelson, whose stepson said she s  lying  about having a sexual encounter with the judge, and whose yearbook that was allegedly signed by Roy Moore has been called into question as a forgery. And then there s another accuser, Tina Johnson who lost her 12-year old son to her mother in a  nasty  custody battle, in a case where Roy Moore represented her mother. It s entirely plausible that Roy Moore s sexual assault accuser, Tina Johnson, had an ax to grind with Moore, the person who was able to successfully prove to the court that Johnson was  unfit  to care for him.To add insult to injury, only yesterday, President Trump appeared with RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel to announce record-breaking fundraising of over $120 million, which McDaniel attributed to President Trump.Watch: ",left-news,"Dec 3, 2017"
7326, Is Gabby Giffords Being Sued By Her Shooter? (IMAGES),"Former Representative Gabby Giffords has made a remarkable recovery after suffering a gunshot wound to the head five years ago, but now she is possibly being sued by her attacker.On January 8, 2011, Giffords was speaking to a group of her constituents outside of a Safeway in Casas Adobes, Arizona when Jared Lee Loughner began firing on the crowd. Loughner s bullets killed six people and injured thirteen, including Giffords. The shooter was detained by people at the event and later pleaded guilty to 19 charges related to the shooting   he is currently serving seven consecutive life sentences in prison.However, although he admitted to his crimes and was sentenced accordingly, a lawsuit has allegedly been filed by Loughner against the former congresswoman for $25 million for psychological and emotional distress. It claims claims that he is innocent and was hand-picked  to be an assassin. My incarceration is illegal. I am actually innocent. I was Framed. I am a victim of project mk-ultra the govt. put a chip in my head to control my mind .Gabby Giffords is in the Illuminati and I have evidence of this I was handpicked illegally to be a sleeper assassin. MY HEAD is full of chips and this evil empire govt is controlling me within. The lawsuit claims all sorts of other insane things, as well. It says that he has been waterboarded repeatedly during his incarceration by the ATF, NSA and CIA. The suit also alleges that his attorney is a  global spy  who forced him to plead guilty and that authorities are making him sick from  microwave testing  and  chemtrails.  It even accuses Giffords of funding the San Bernardino shooters.The timing of this lawsuit has made some people think that it is a hoax. Just days before it was filed, a similar lawsuit was filed in Michigan against Uber, supposedly by the Kalamazoo mass shooter, Jason Brian Dalton. That lawsuit turned out to be fake and apparently the Giffords  suit looks a lot like the Dalton suit. Tucson News reports:The envelopes of both the alleged Loughner lawsuit and the fake Dalton lawsuit have very similar characteristics.Both have the same three stamps in the top right corner, have similar handwriting and are postmarked in Philadelphia, PA.The envelopes, do indeed look very similar and when you read Loughner s alleged lawsuit there seems to be a whole lot of crazy crammed into it.

14592,WARNING: FEDS PREDICT $30 TRILLION DOLLAR DEBT Because Of These Two Key Things,"You can blame the escalating debt on Obamacare and taxes We can thank Obama for this The federal government will be flirting with $30 trillion in debt within a decade, the Congressional Budget Office reported Monday, blaming an aging population, new spending and tax cuts approved on Capitol Hill, and the growing burden from Obamacare for erasing the progress Washington had made over the past few years.Analysts said Obamacare will chase more workers out of the labor force over the next five years, adding pressure to an economy still struggling to spring to life more than seven years into the Obama recovery.The Affordable Care Act itself is still struggling to attract a customer base, the CBO said, lowering its estimate for the number of people who will sign up for the exchanges from 21 million to 13 million   a drop of nearly 40 percent in projections. Customers collecting taxpayer subsidies this year will be 11 million, down from the 15 million the CBO projected a year ago.The grim news comes with less than a year left for President Obama to put the law on firmer footing as he seeks to head off what is likely to be a last effort at repealing the act after November s elections.The economic front is somewhat brighter for Mr. Obama, who seven years into the recovery will finally see significant sustained growth of 2.5 percent this year and 2.6 percent next year, the CBO said.That will be followed by a cooling off, with growth dropping below 2 percent in 2019 and 2020. The economic gains will continue to go disproportionately to the wealthy, helping boost income tax revenue but limiting payroll taxes, which will put even more pressure on the entitlement programs that are driving up deficits.The biggest fiscal dent, however, was made late last year when Mr. Obama and the Republican-run Congress struck a deal. The president won significant spending hikes, and Republicans insisted on a new round of special tax breaks that, combined, reversed years of progress and added nearly $750 billion to projected deficits over the next decade. After six consecutive years in which the deficit has declined relative to the size of the economy, this year s deficit   at 2.9 percent of gross domestic product (GDP)   is anticipated to increase for the first time since it peaked at 9.8 percent in 2009,  the CBO said.Deficits will continue to rise over the next 10 years, topping $1 trillion again in 2022 and reaching $1.4 trillion in 2026, the analysts said.The accumulation of those deficits will deepen the gross public debt from $18.1 trillion at the end of 2015 to $29.3 trillion in 2026. By contrast, the debt stood at $10.6 trillion when Mr. Obama took office in 2009.Looking decades into the future, the picture only gets worse, the CBO said.READ MORE: WT",politics,"Jan 26, 2016"

She s all wrong on this point   this just shows how out of touch the media is with Americans. Americans want the TRUTH and DO NOT want to be spoon-fed information. Couric is making assumptions that Americans are idiiots SHE S VERY WRONG! Consumers are increasingly gravitating toward outlets that basically tell them what they want to hear, reinforce their beliefs,  she said. A friend of mine said they re seeking affirmation, not information. So given that, how do you restore trust in the media writ large if people are so divided about which media outlets are actually fair and accurate? KATIE COURIC: Let s move on and talk about sort of the bifurcated nature of the media these days. Consumers are increasingly gravitating toward outlets that basically tell them what they want to hear, reinforce their beliefs. A friend of mine said they re seeking affirmation, not information. So given that, how do you restore trust in the media writ large if people are so divided about which media outlets are actually fair and accurate? Anybody. Nik, you want to take that?NIKHIL DEOGUN: Sure, and I would say that the I think Gerry [Baker] made a very eloquent argument on the previous point, and it leads to what you re asking about, which is, I think there is a tendency we should not fall under the trap of just holding one person to one standard and everyone else to a different standard. I do think it s interesting. Three of us have all worked at the Wall Street Journal or work at the Wall Street Journal GERARD BAKER: I did before I left the office this morning.DEOGUN: Yes. Exactly. And our former Gerry s predecessor, a couple predecessors ago, Paul Steiger, used to always remind us, saying,  Look, I could argue something round or I could argue it flat. But in the end, stick to the facts.  I think sometimes there s too much of a tendency to interpret a fact to a degree that it goes into opinion. And I think part of our job is to, again, remind ourselves that our readers are not as readers, viewers, users, are not as ignorant, as stupid as we think they are, and I think part of that is to be more transparent. Part of that is to be more forthcoming about what we know and what we don t know.

And then my mind drifts to Hillary and Benghazi The Obama administration is emptying the military s Guantanamo Bay detention facility of avowed terrorists captured fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq, but several American service members languish in another military prison for actions on those same battlefields that their supporters say merit clemency, if not gratitude.Among the prison population at Fort Leavenworth, in Kansas, are remaining members of the so-called  Leavenworth 10,  convicted service members doing terms ranging from 10 to 40 years for heat-of-the-battle decisions their supporters say saved American lives.[quote_box_center] The very people who protect our freedoms and liberties are having their own freedoms and liberties taken away,  said retired U.S. Army Col. Allen West, a former congressman and political commentator.  I think it s appalling and no one is talking about this issue. [/quote_box_center]The  Leavenworth 10  is the name given to a fluctuating number of men housed at Leavenworth for actions in Iraq and Afghanistan that their supporters say were justified. Over the years, a handful have been paroled, and more have been incarcerated.Among the more well-known cases is that of Army First Lt. Clint Lorance, who is serving a 20-year sentence for ordering his men to shoot two suspected Taliban scouts in July 2012 in the Kandahar Province of Afghanistan. Lorance had just taken command of the platoon after the prior leader and several others were killed days before. The Taliban suspects were on motorcycles and matched descriptions given by a pilot who flew over the area earlier and spotted them as scouts.A Facebook page devoted to Lorance s case has drawn more than 12,000 likes, and supporters have launched a website, FreeClintLorance.com, dedicated to winning his release. A WhiteHouse.gov petition calling for Lorance to be pardoned garnered nearly 125,000 signatures, but the White House has not taken action.Critics say Lorance was given a military trial, and his conviction was based in large part on the testimony of men serving under him.It was September of 2010 when Sgt. Derrick Miller of Maryland, on a combat mission in a Taliban-held area of Afghanistan, was warned the unit s base had been penetrated. An Afghan suspected of being an enemy combatant was brought to Miller for interrogation and wound up dead. Miller claimed the suspect tried to grab his gun and that he shot him in self-defense. But he was convicted and sentenced to life in prison.U.S. Army Master Sgt. John Hatley   a highly decorated, 20-year vet who served in Operation Desert Storm and did another three tours during the Iraq War   also is serving a life sentence at Leavenworth. His conviction stems from an April, 2007, incident in Iraq in which he and his unit captured enemies following a firefight. He radioed a U.S. detention facility to notify officials he was bringing in four prisoners, but was ordered to let them go, according to his legal team.Two years later, a sergeant who had served with Hatley, Jesse Cunningham, was facing charges for assaulting another officer and falling asleep at his post. As leverage for a plea deal, he told investigators that Hatley and two other officers had taken the insurgents to a remote location, blindfolded them and shot each in the back of the head. He claimed their bodies were dumped in a canal, though none was ever found.Hatley, now 47, insists he and his men let the insurgents go, but believes he was punished in the interest of the government s relations with Baghdad. When concerns over appeasing a foreign country are allowed to interfere with justice for the purpose of the U.S. government or the military demonstrating that we, the military or the U.S. government will hold our soldiers accountable using a fatally flawed military judicial system, it doesn t matter what the truth is; it matters only that there is only the appearance of the truth,  he wrote in a message to supporters posted on freeJohnHatley.com.Law experts say military service members face a daunting task once accused of committing crimes in the heat of war. Killing on the battlefield is not the same as [a police officer] killing someone on the streets,  Dan Conway, an attorney who specializes in military law, told FoxNews.com.  When a cop uses force, there s a line of duty investigation. When a soldier uses force, it is investigated as criminal, and non-infantry investigators handle the case, many who have no combat experience. If you had experts handling the investigation, you d have much more balance,  he added.While the military rightly holds its soldiers to a high standard of justice, detainees housed at Guantanamo Bay have been freed even with no mitigating circumstances or reasonable belief of rehabilitation. The release of Gitmo detainees began during the presidency of George W. Bush in 2005 when nearly 200 detainees were released before any tribunals were held.According to a March 2015 memo released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, of the 647 detainees transferred or released, 17.9 percent were confirmed of re-engaging in extremist activity with another 10.7 percent suspected of doing the same.

It doesn t change the fact however, that an eye-witness has come forward to say the woman accusing Trump of sexual assault on the plane, was actually pursuing him Donald Trump s campaign says a British man is countering claims that the GOP presidential nominee groped a woman on a cross-country flight more than three decades ago.The man says he was sitting across from the accuser and contacted the Trump campaign because he was incensed by her account   which is at odds with what he witnessed. I have only met this accuser once and frankly cannot imagine why she is seeking to make out that Trump made sexual advances on her. Not only did he not do so (and I was present at all times) but it was she that was the one being flirtatious,  Anthony Gilberthorpe said in a note provided to The Post by the Trump campaign.In an exclusive interview arranged by the campaign, Gilberthorpe said he was on the flight   in either 1980 or 1981  where Jessica Leeds claimed Trump groped her.Gilberthorpe, 54, said he was sitting across the first class aisle from the couple and saw nothing inappropriate. Leeds was wearing a white pantsuit, he said, while Trump was wearing a suit and cuff-links, which he gave to his British flight companion.Indeed, Gilberthorpe claimed, Leeds was  trying too hard  in her attempt to win Trump over. She wanted to marry him,  Gilberthorpe said of Leeds, who apparently made the confession when Trump excused himself and went to the bathroom.There was no kissing, but the  shrill  Leeds was  very much in your face  with the real estate developer.Gilberthorpe made headlines in 2014, when he went public with a claim that as a 17-year-old he procured boys (some who  could have been  underage ) for sex parties with high-ranking British politicians.Gilberthorpe has no evidence to back up his claim   just his self-described excellent memory. What she said about Trump is wrong,  he told The Post.  I mean, no decent human being could sit by and have a woman go on television and tell the United States of America   accuse an individual of sexually molesting. It s wrong for Trump, it s wrong for me. But you know something else? It s wrong for the American people,  he said.Leeds alleged this week in interviews with The New York Times and CNN that Trump groped her, touching her  wherever he could find a landing spot. The guy in the seat across the aisle could see. And I kept thinking, maybe the stewardess is going to come and he ll stop, but she never came,  Leeds told CNN.That allegation infuriated Gilberthorpe, a retiree living in northwest England, who said,  That I sat there   eyes bulging   and not intervening is nonsense. If there s evidence Trump s done it, sure, hang him from the post, but I was there, I was in a position to know that what she said was wrong, wrong, wrong,  he said.He immediately recognized Leeds when he saw video of her in The Times earlier this week holding up a younger picture of herself. Undoubtedly it was her,  he said.  I have a good photographic memory. I recognized her. He said he contacted the Trump campaign because he didn t like that Leeds said that another passenger sat by while she was molested. Via: NYP ",politics,"Oct 14, 2016"
20343,MINNESOTA CHURCH Places 1800 “Blessed Ramadan” Signs Around Twin Cities To Make “Muslims Feel More Welcome” [VIDEO],"Here s the truth about the Somali Muslim population in the Twin Cities where these signs are being placed around by a Christian pastor:Minneapolis-St. Paul has what the media refers to as  an ISIS problem. It s no coincidence ISIS is recruiting in the Twin Cities area. There is a huge population of 30,000 Somali Muslims who live there.A recent Business Insider report states there has been a  string of Islamic State-related arrests over roughly the last year  due to the  large Somali community.  Andrew Lugar, U.S. Attorney for Minnesota, speaking at an FBI news conference stated:  To be clear. We have a terror-recruiting problem in Minnesota Parents and loved ones should know that there is not one master recruiter organizing in the Somali community locally the person radicalizing your son, your brother, your friend, may not be a stranger. It may be their best friend right here in town. The deception in the Christian Church is absolutely astounding. Instead of heeding the words of the Apostle John, who aptly said,  every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world,  many have decide to listen to those of the antichrist religion of Islam. Sadly, many have no only listened to engage them, but they have even gone so far as to support them. Such is the case of 17 churches in Minnesota.Designated terror group CAIR (Council on American-Islamic Relations) has supported Christian churches putting up  Blessed Ramadan  signs to promote an alleged unity between Christianity and Islam.Apparently, about 1800 signs were distributed in the Twin Cities and Duluth in order to  help Muslims feel more welcome in the community,  according to a Fox 21 reporter.I have been in St. Paul and Minneapolis. I have seen the Muslim neighborhoods and have heard from some of the people that live in the area around them that there is nothing but death and destruction that surrounds these people. Yet, they are supposed to be made to  feel more welcome in the community  by Christian churches that promote the holidays of a false prophet and antichrist? I just don t understand that.According to the report, the  Blessed Ramadan  signs are supposed to show support to Muslims who have recently been targeted after negativity stemming from the Orlando shooting.Rector Bill van Oss of St. Paul s Church says that the signs were put out with the goal to  find the common ground that we have as believers in god  to work toward a country and a world of justice and peace for all people. Watch here:Well, doesn t that sounds all euphoric and filled with happy unicorns? The fact of the matter is that Christians and Muslims are diametrically opposed to the person, work and nature of the Creator. Christians see that God has revealed Himself as one God, yet in three distinct persons, the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. The Muslim only see God as both one person and one god. Therefore, while they will acknowledge Jesus Christ as a prophet, they will neither heed His words nor acknowledge his virgin birth and divinity.So, No Mr. Bill, these signs are not what you claim they are. They are capitulation on your part and the part of your professed Christian neighbors and parishioners to not feel uncomfortable with confronting Muslims with the false antichrist teachings of Muhammad and the Koran and calling them to repentance to the Law of God and the Lord Jesus Christ.

22027,"Ben Carson Home Vandalized with Anti-Trump Graffiti, CNN Accuses Him of Lying","21st Century Wire says The culture wars continue to ramp-up after events in Charlottesville. White House Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson reported on Wednesday that his Virginia home was  vandalized by people who also wrote hateful rhetoric about President Trump. We were out of town, but other kind, embarrassed neighbors cleaned up most of the mess before we returned,  he said.Carson issued a statement in which he noted a personal experience of an incident which took place after he and is wife previously purchased a farm in Maryland: One of the neighbors immediately put up a Confederate flag. A friend of ours who is an African-American three-star general was coming to visit and immediately turned around concluding that he was in the wrong place. Interestingly, all the other neighbors immediately put up American flags shaming the other neighbor who took down the Confederate flag. In both instances, less than kind behavior was met by people taking the high road   We could all learn from these examples. Hatred and bigotry unfortunately still exists in our country and we must all continue to fight it, but let s use the right tools. Unfortunately, Carson s comments were met with a cynical and disrespectful response from the divisive gatekeepers at CNN, who proceeded to insult the African-American Republican cabinet minister. Incredibly, CNN s  national political reporter  Maeve Reston implied he was lying, saying  that Carson s  anecdote is worth a FACT-CHECK :This Ben Carson anecdote is worth a fact-check .. https://t.co/CvJSDSkfxW  Maeve Reston (@MaeveReston) August 16, 2017Along with the criminal act of vandalism, CNN s attack on Carson also proves that the New Left in America do not accept the presence of an African-American, or  black  conservative in politics, and will seek to undermine him simply for being in  the wrong party.

17234,BREAKING: SUPREME COURT BLOCKS TEXAS ABORTION RESTRICTIONS,"Wow! The liberal Supreme Court s really making their views known with the past few decisions. Thank goodness for the ACLJ and all the good work they do: This afternoon, the Supreme Court of the United States ordered to stay the Fifth Circuit s ruling upholding the common-sense abortion restrictions passed by Texas in 2013. In a 5-4 vote with Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Scalia, Justice Thomas, and Justice Alito dissenting, the Court granted the application to stay the 5th Circuit decision.As The New York Times reports:The Supreme Court on Monday allowed nine Texas abortion clinics to remain open while the justices consider whether to hear an appeal from a decision effectively ordering them to close. [ ]The case concerns two parts of a state law that imposes strict requirements on abortion providers. One requires all abortion clinics in the state to meet the standards for  ambulatory surgical centers,  including regulations concerning buildings, equipment and staffing. The other requires doctors performing abortions to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital.Other parts of the law took effect in 2013, causing about half of the state s 41 abortion clinics to close. If the contested provisions take effect, abortion rights advocates said, the number of clinics will again be halved. The Associated Press has more details:The Supreme Court order will remain in effect at least until the court decides whether to hear the clinics  appeal of the lower court ruling, not before the fall.The court s decision to block the regulations is a strong indication that the justices will hear the full appeal, which could be the biggest abortion case at the Supreme Court in nearly 25 years. The ACLJ is mobilizing all of our resources to continue to support Texas as it stands up for the health of women and the lives of unborn babies.At the Fifth Circuit, we filed an amicus brief detailing the dangers of unregulated abortion and the abortion industry s deceptions.We are preparing to file briefs at the Supreme Court to vigorously defend this pro-life law and aggressively protect the lives of thousands of unborn babies and women in need.Our pro-life advocacy is vital in defending the constitutional rights of pro-life crisis pregnancy centers, protecting the health of women and children, and urging Congress to be a voice for the voiceless.Via: ACLJ ",Government News,"Jun 29, 2015"
6671, BREAKING: Cruz Names Carly Fiorina As His VP Running Mate,"After suffering debilitating losses in five northeastern states   Maryland, Delaware, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Pennsylvania   and his  alliance  with John Kasich crumbling after only two days, Ted Cruz needed to find a way to stop GOP frontrunner Donald Trump.And he found the way   at least he thinks he does.The Cruz campaign announced Wednesday afternoon that failed CEO, failed Senate candidate, failed presidential candidate and largely disliked Carly Fiorina will be the Texas Senator s VP running mate.Simply put, this is Ted Cruz  sad, pathetic attempt at a hail Mary to pander to female GOP voters (who loath Trump). And what s even sadder is Cruz only picked Fiorina out of sheer logistics   not because he necessarily likes her or thinks she would be a good Vice President. According to Politico:The hope within the campaign is that Fiorina will help Cruz in California, which will award 172 delegates on June 7. Fiorina is scheduled to give the keynote address at this weekend s California Republican Party convention, speaking hours after Cruz takes the stage.The move comes at a time of growing desperation within Cruz circles. Some in the campaign worry that the Texas senator will lose Indiana on Tuesday and lose other key states in May, paving the way for a Trump nomination.Yes, the women who helped dent Silicon Valley and lost a statewide election to Barbara Boxer by 10 percent is the perfect choice for Cruz s California comeback. As it becomes increasingly clear that Trump s negative image will spell certain doom for the GOP in November, Cruz has literally taken it upon himself to pull a John McCain circa 2008. Only this time America knows who Fiorina is, and they don t like her very much.Fiorina suspended her campaign after poor showings in Iowa and New Hampshire and subsequently endorsed Cruz, traveling he country as a surrogate for his campaign.The decision was two weeks in the making as reports surfaced the Cruz campaign was heavily vetting the former CEO, and placed her at the top of a  serious  contender list for V.P. Never before has a losing candidate pulled such a desperate maneuver to save their campaign. Hopefully this comes back to bite them both in the behind.

2528, Neo-Nazis Think They Know Exactly Who Is Responsible For Forcing Flynn Out; Predicts Others Will Fall Too,"After evidence surfaced that suggested Russia had blackmail-worthy dirt on Trump s national security adviser, General Michael Flynn, Flynn was forced to resign on Monday. Some Americans aren t convinced that that was the real reason, though. Some are blaming it on  the Jews. Neo-Nazi writers are upset that retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn has resigned from his position as national security adviser. The anti-Semites are lionizing Flynn as  one of our best guys  and a  true patriot  who has  been quite critical of the Jews in the past.  They are also lamenting that his resignation is  definitely a loss   to the Jews  and are speculating that he was pushed out by  more subversive elements in the White House. Source: Media MattersIt s not surprising that Flynn supporters would feel this way. After all, he s one of theirs.The disgraced former national security adviser has repeatedly pushed toxic views. Last July, Flynn shared a tweet that read in part,  Not anymore, Jews. Not Anymore.  (He later apologized.) He claimed on Twitter that  Fear of Muslims is RATIONAL.  Flynn also endorsed the work of racist author Mike Cernovich, who has frequently pushed white nationalist themes on his Twitter account (many of which he later deleted). Cernovich has claimed that  diversity is code for white genocide,   Blacks use guns for murder. Whites use guns to kill themselves,  and  Diversity is bad for national security. The Daily Stormer, which is just one of the Neo-Nazi sites that s gaining popularity since Trump s election, had this to say about Flynn s resignation:This is giving a victory to the kike media.I actually didn t think the block on the travel ban was a loss. I think that was all part of the plan to get the public stirred up against activist judges, to get ready for the Supreme Court to rule on an even more hardcore version of the Moslem ban.But this.This is definitely a loss.To the Jews.Infostormer, another such site, predicts that more are about to fall:We re going to be keeping a much closer eye on the White House factional struggles in the coming days and weeks, because if my senses are correct, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will likely be the next man attacked for his ties to Russia and Vladimir Putin.The lead-up to the demise of General Flynn was somewhat ignored by us due to the sheer level of nonsense that has been pushed forth by the Lugenpresse lately, but we won t make that mistake again.The Jews are not going to get away with another bullying attack on our regime   they will be called out, and they will be defeated if and when they try again.I can t believe I m about to say this, but I hope the Nazis are right about Tillerson. As for the rest, well, it s not their  regime.  The presidency belongs to the American people all of us, even those of us who are Jewish. If a member of the government is antisemitic or in bed with the Russian government, you d better damned well believe that we will do everything in our power to stop them.Featured image by Mario Tama via Getty Images",News,"February 14, 2017"
16944,GOP HOUSE LEADERSHIP Place Political Careers Before National Security: Why They Are Reportedly Caving (Again) To Democrats,"Is this why we worked so hard to get a GOP majority in the House and Senate? Spineless weasels Republican House members blasted their GOP leadership Wednesday for caving to Democratic leaders  demand that they abandon the House s bipartisan bill to tighten screening of refugee applicants from Syria and Iraq. The bill to bolster the Syrian and Iraqi [refugee] vetting process passed with a veto-proof majority and is supported by a vast majority of Americans,  said Rep. Richard Hudson (R-NC)57% , who is one of the two co-authors of the original House bill that GOP leaders are now abandoning. It would be a shame to bow to the wishes of Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV) and the White House, leaving our country vulnerable to foreign terrorism,  he told Breitbart News exclusively.After the Paris attacks that killed over 120 people, the House passed a bill   with a huge bipartisan majority   that would implement tough screening requirements for refugees. The bill was criticized by Democrats and President Obama, who vowed to veto the legislation and suggested that Republicans work with them to tighten oversight of visas given to legal visitors.Now, House Republican leaders are reportedly planning to abandon their original idea to tighten screening of refugees and are instead caving to Democrats who want to only fix security gaps in the legal-visitor visa program.Republican House leadership is backing away from the refugee problem because they fear their fix will be rejected by Democrats and lead to a partial government shut-down.Rep. Mo Brooks (R-AL) also told Breitbart News exclusively that he isn t  surprised  that Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) is following in the steps of former House Speaker Rep. John Boehner (R-OH)32% by bowing to Democrats, rather than putting up a fight.He called the original vote  a show vote  that was arranged by the leaders, and told Breitbart News that the entire refugee program needs to be stripped of its funding.Rep. Brian Babin (R-TX) told Breitbart News exclusively that GOP House leadership should fix both problems.  This should not be an either or question,  Babin said.  Both should be addressed in a timely manner. We should concern ourselves first and foremost with the safety and security of the American people. Babin recently released a letter, signed by more than 70 of his colleagues, calling on House leadership to include language in the must-pass omnibus spending bill that would defund the refugee resettlement program. More than 70 of my colleagues joined me in calling for an immediate suspension in the refugee program to give us time to put in place security measures that the Administration has failed to implement  Babin told Breitbart News. We must restore Congressional authority and ensure that Congress has a final sign-off on any Administration proposed Security measures. Congress has until December 11th to pass the omnibus bill.Via: Breitbart News",Government News,"Dec 2, 2015"
11071,OPEN BORDERS ADVOCATE NANCY PELOSI Gives Gibberish Laden Reason For Opposing Border Wall: “You have to understand this part of the country” [Video],"House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi was on Meet the Press and let out another gibberish laden response to a question. Does anyone out there understand what she meant by her comments about the wall. How does it mean Trump is weak if he wants a wall? Twisted reasoning is all that comes from Pelosi these days especially when in 2006 most prominent Democrats voted to build a barrier at the border. Immoral and unwise ? How is it immoral and unwise to want to protect your people? You have to understand this part of the country. There s a community going through it. WHAT THE HECK HAPPENED TO THE 2006 BORDER WALL FENCE?Remember the promise of a fence on our southern border? Yes, it was the plan but the $1.2 billion dollar plan was never executed as proposed. You can thank our Liar in Chief and a popular Republican for that WE RECENTLY POSTED THIS VIDEO OF AN IMMIGRATION OFFICIAL SAYING BUILDING A BORDER FENCE  ISN T POSSIBLE  EVEN THOUGH $1.2 BILLION WAS GIVEN IN 2006 FOR A FENCE:  In his speech in El Paso on immigration reform on May 10, 2011, Obama declared that the fence along the border with Mexico is  now basically complete.  Like much of what comes out of the Obama administration, that was a lie. What was supposed to be built was a double layered fence with barbed-wire on top, and room for a security vehicle to patrol between the layers. Except for 36 of the seven-hundred mile fence, what was built looks like the picture above or the one below.But that doesn t stop your liar in chief. He claims. We have gone above and beyond what was requested by the very Republicans who said they supported broader reform as long as we got serious about enforcement,  Obama said.  All the stuff they asked for, we ve done. But even though we ve answered these concerns, I ve got to say I suspect there are still going to be some who are trying to move the goal posts on us one more time. Maybe he s right the goal posts were moved, but to make the job easier.The Secure Fence Act was introduced on Sept. 13, 2006 by Rep Peter King (R-NY) and passed Congress on a bi-partisan basis. In the House of Representatives, the Fence Act passed 283 -138 on September 14, 2006. On September 29, 2006, the Fence Act passed in the Senate 80 -19. The Secure Fence Act of 2006 s goal was to help secure America s borders to decrease illegal entry, drug trafficking, and security threats by building 700 miles (1,100 km) of physical barriers along the Mexico-United States border. Additionally, the law authorized more vehicle barriers, checkpoints, and lighting as well as authorizing the Department of Homeland Security to increase the use of advanced technology such as cameras, satellites, and unmanned aerial vehicles to reinforce infrastructure at the border. So far less than 40 miles of a real fence have been built   most of it during the Bush Administration.Of the almost 700 miles of fencing, DHS reports there are currently 36.3 miles of double-layered fencing, as the bill required, the kind with enough gap that you can drive a vehicle between the layers. But the majority of the fencing erected has been made from vehicle barriers with single-layer pedestrian fencing, the kind of barriers that are designed to stop vehicles rather than people. The design specifications vary, depending on geography and climate characteristics, but according to the Customs and Border Patrol website, those include  post on rail  steel set in concrete; steel picket-style fence set in concrete; vehicle bollards similar to those found around federal buildings;  Normandy; vehicle fence consisting of steel beams; and concrete jersey walls with steel mesh. The first blow against the promised fence was made by Kay Bailey Hutchison, Republican Senator from Texas, at the urging of DHS she proposed an amendment to give the Department discretion to decide what type of fence was appropriate in different areas. The law was amended to read,  Nothing in this paragraph shall require the Secretary of Homeland Security to install fencing, physical barriers, roads, lighting, cameras, and sensors in a particular location along an international border of the United States, if the Secretary determines that the use or placement of such resources is not the most appropriate means to achieve and maintain operational control over the international border at such location.  Hutchison s amendment was included in a federal budget bill in late 2007 despite the fact that Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., had a cow he argued the amendment effectively killed the border fence promised in the 2006 bill, he was right. Hutchison s intentions may have been honorable, but she didn t foresee Barack Obama being the next president.When Janet Napolitano became Obama s first DHS she took advantage of Ms. Hutchison s 2007 amendment, instead of building a fence which look something like the below, she built a fence that was mostly a combination of the two pictures above.When She was still Governor of Arizona Janet Napolitano said,  You show me a 50-foot wall, and I ll show you a 51-foot ladder at the border. And she may be right The fence will never STOP all illegal crossings. The purpose of the fence is two-fold, slowing the intruders and making them visible to members of the border patrol. The rest of the work is done by human beings.Very little of the Israeli separation barrier erected to keep out terrorists is a wall, most of the 400 miles of the barrier which has received so much international scorn is a two layered fence like section of their barrier below. The fence has served its purpose, in 2002, the year before construction started, 457 Israelis were murdered; in 2009, 8 Israelis were killed.The reason it has been effective is not simply the fence itself but how the fence is guarded and patrolled. And that s what will make our fence along the Mexican border work.Here s the bottom line. Back in 2006 the people of the U.S. were promised a border fence. Since then thanks to Kay Bailey Hutchison and Barack Obama 95% of the fence wasn t built. The arguments against the fence are bogus especially if you look at Israel s history. It s time for America to demand that its leaders build the fence they promised. No one can honestly say it wont work, after all it hasn t been tried. Via: The Lid",politics,"Apr 24, 2017"
13688,LOL! PRINCE of Country Who Gave Hillary $50 Million BEGS Americans NOT To Vote For Trump,"Sounds like one of the best reasons ever TO vote for Trump A Saudi prince has urged Americans not to vote for Donald Trump in the upcoming general election.Turki al-Faisal, who served as Saudia Arabia s ambassador to the US from 2005 to 2007, spoke against the presumptive Republican nominee during a foreign policy dinner in Washington, DC on Thursday.He blasted Trump s proposal to ban Muslims from entering the US, which the billionaire first formulated in December last year before renewing his vow on Wednesday. For the life of me, I cannot believe that a country like the United States can afford to have someone as president who simply says,  These people are not going to be allowed to come to the United States,  Turki said according to the Huffington Post. It s up to you, it s not up to me,  Turki added.  I just hope you, as American citizens, will make the right choice in November. This plea to NOT vote for Trump should come as no surprise since Saudi Arabia has donated up to $50 million to the Clinton FoundationWFB  The gulf nations represent three of the largest donors to the foundation, but that is hardly the extent of their ties to the Clintons. Qatari, UAE, and Saudi firms paid Bill Clinton millions of dollars for speeches during the time Hillary served as secretary of state, when she also approved weapons deals with all three countries worth billions of dollars to U.S. defense firms, many of which are also Clinton Foundation donors.Bill Clinton has praised the Qataris as  intelligent, forward looking  investment partners for their collaboration on Clinton Foundation projects. One of Hillary s top advisers, Cheryl Mills, served on the board of the New York University campus in Abu Dhabi. Bill Clinton is the friend and former classmate of Saudi Prince Turki bin Faisal Al Saud, who recently attended a lavish Clinton Foundation conference in Marrakech, hosted by the King of Morocco. The Bill Clinton presidential library in Little Rock was funded in part by a $10 million from the Saudi Royal family.Turk, who went to Georgetown University in Washington, DC, isn t currently part of Saudia Arabia s government but serves as the chairman of the King Faisal Center for Research and Islamic Studies, a cultural organization that conducts research in politics, sociology and heritage. h/t: Breitbart News Via: Daily Mail ",politics,"Jun 15, 2016"

7594, Sanders Campaign Fights Back After Ohio Bans Youth From Primaries," Twenty-two states, including the District of Columbia, allow 17-year-olds to vote in primary elections as long as they turn 18 by the time the general election is held in November. The rule allows many youth to begin participating in the democratic process of voting for the very first time, but Ohio s Republican Secretary of State Jon Husted reversed the rule in Ohio, revoking the rights for 17-year-olds to vote in Ohio s primaries on March 15th. For both Republicans and Democrats, Ohio will be a key state and every vote will matter. For the Bernie Sanders campaign, the reversal is a blow, as the campaign s strongest demographic is young voters, where they have received over 80 percent support in many states from voters ages 18-29. It is an outrage that the secretary of state in Ohio is going out of his way to keep young people   significantly African-American young people, Latino young people   from participating,  said Senator Sanders in a released on March 8th. Sanders  campaign cited US Census data which shows 17-year-old voters are more likely to be African-Americans and Latinos.Ohio s Secretary of State, Jon Husted, argued over the language of Ohio s rule in December, claiming 17-year-olds can still vote, just not to elect a candidate. This isn t the first time Ohio Republicans have tried to deter voter turnout. In 2015, Republican Ohio State Representatives sponsored a bill to demand a poll tax in order to vote, despite poll taxes being unconstitutional. The tax was tucked into a Voter ID bill, which was pushed for under the false assumption Voter ID laws prevent fraud, although voter fraud is virtually non-existent in Ohio. If a voter does not have a photo ID, they will have to pay $8.50 for a voter ID card.  In 2015, Hillary Clinton s campaign sued Ohio to repeal several Republican voter suppression tactics which helped George W. Bush win Ohio in 2004.Featured image via Addicting Info",News,"March 9, 2016"
16649,ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION CASE: Justice Roberts Used Obama’s Own Words Against Him,"It s great to see one of the Justices questioning the dictatorship of Obama. The vote will likely be a split vote even though the federal law should be followed. Illegal is illegal. If they side with Obama then we ll have millions of illegals who ll get amnesty just in time for the 2016 election. Couldn t be better timing for Barack Let s hope that Justice Roberts finds his  manhood and votes with the American people. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. prodded the Obama administration Monday to explain President Obama s immigration flip-flop, when Mr. Obama in 2014 reversed himself and decided he did, after all, have powers to grant a tentative amnesty to as many as 5 million illegal immigrants.Mr. Obama had repeatedly denied he had that kind of power, then after the 2014 election, when Congress refused to act on his policies, the president claimed a do-over and said he did have the power.Chief Justice Roberts wondered what changed in Mr. Obama s mind, and even read back one of Mr. Obama s quotes to Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr. recounting the president saying he would be  ignoring the law  if he were to grant a broad stay of deportation to millions of illegal immigrants. What was he talking about?  the chief justice prodded.Mr. Verrilli said Mr. Obama may have changed his mind after asking the Justice Department s legal advisory branch to take a closer look at his powers. You know, what happened here is that the president and the secretary went to the Office of Legal Counsel and asked for an opinion about the scope of their authority to  the scope of this discretionary authority, and they got one. And they exercised it consistently with that and up to the limits of that and no further,  Mr. Verrilli said.Immigrant-rights activists had repeatedly told Mr. Obama he had authority to grant  deferred action  to million of illegal immigrants, but the president shot those requests down, telling the activists he didn t think he could defend that action in court.Read more: WT",Government News,"Apr 18, 2016"

21496,SECRET DUMPS OF TOXIC WASTE ON PRIVATE PROPERTY BY EPA: Will The Government Bullies At The EPA Finally Be Exposed?,"This story gets more and more unbelievable every day The EPA has a record of releasing toxic runoff from mines in two tiny Colorado towns that dates to 2005, a local mine owner claims.The 3-million-gallon heavy-metal spill two weeks ago in Silverton polluted three states and touched off national outrage. But the EPA escaped public wrath in 2005 when it secretly dumped up to 15,000 tons of poisonous waste into another mine 124 miles away. That dump   containing arsenic, lead and other materials   materialized in runoff in the town of Leadville, said Todd Hennis, who owns both mines along with numerous others. If a private company had done this, they would ve been fined out of existence,  Hennis said.  I have been battling the EPA for 10 years and they have done nothing but create pollution. About 20 percent (of Silverton residents) think it s on purpose so they can declare the whole area a Superfund site. Like Silverton to the south, Leadville was founded in the late 1800s as a mining town and is the only municipality in its county. Today, tourism is its livelihood.It s against this backdrop that the Environmental Protection Agency began lobbying to declare part of Leadville a Superfund site in order to develop a recreational area called the Mineral Belt Trail. The project was officially completed in 2000, but apparently the agency stayed on and continued to work in town.In late 2005, the EPA collected tons of sludge from two Leadville mines and secretly dumped it down the shaft of the New Mikado mine without notifying Hennis, its owner, according to documents reviewed by Watchdog.A drainage tunnel had been installed at the bottom of the mine shaft by the U.S. government in 1942, meaning that any snow or rain would leach toxins into the surrounding land.Hennis said the EPA claims it has installed a treatment pond near the tunnel to clean runoff. The EPA rebuffed his demands to clean up the mess it created in his mine, he said. In frustration, Hennis sent the county sheriff a certified notice that any EPA officials found near his property were trespassing and should be arrested.Despite that history of bitterness, in 2010, the EPA asked Hennis to grant its agents access to Gold King Mine in Silverton because the agency was investigating hazardous runoff from other mines in the region. I said,  No, I don t want you on my land out of fear that you will create additional pollution like you did in Leadville,  Hennis said. The official request turned into a threat, Hennis said:  They said,  If you don t give us access within four days, we will fine you $35,000 a day. An EPA administrative order dated May 12, 2011 said its inspectors wanted to conduct  drilling of holes and installing monitoring wells, sampling and monitoring water, soil, and mine waste material from mine water rock dumps as necessary to evaluate releases of hazardous substances When the EPA hit Hennis with $300,000 in fines, he said, he  waved the white flag  and allowed the agency on his property.So for the past four years, the EPA has been working at the mine and two others nearby   all which border a creek that funnels into the Animas River. One mine to the north had been walled off with cement by its owner but it continued to leak water into Gold King. The EPA installed a drainage ditch on the Gold King side of the mine to alleviate the problem, but then accidentally filled the ditch with dirt and rocks last summer while building a water-retention wall.That was the wall that burst when a contractor punched a hole in the top on Aug. 5, sending a bright orange stream cascading down. The EPA looked like the Keystone Kops as anger intensified in the media and general public: 24 hours passed with no notification to the lower states or Navajo Nation; the White House ignored mentioning the incident; and it took a week for the EPA administrator to tour Durango downstream, while refusing to visit Silverton itself.The EPA says cleaning ponds have been installed to leach toxins from the water, and claims that anything released now is actually cleaner than before the spill occurred. The fallout from this disaster in the lower states is still unknown.Also unknown is the fate of Silverton itself. For months, the EPA has been pushing town leaders into allowing designation as a Superfund site out of belief that the whole town is contaminated. This is something the town has resisted, as its reputation is at stake and no current tests have shown any evidence of toxic soil levels. Whenever we hear the word  EPA,  we think of Superfund,  said Silverton Town Board Trustee David Zanoni.  They say,  We want to work together.  That s B.S. They want to come in and take over. The water up here is naturally filled with minerals. They don t need to be here cleaning up. If the EPA s litany of mistakes at Gold King mine is a barometer, Zanoni said, handing over the reins of Silverton would be a disaster. They had no contingency plan in case all of this went to hell,  he said.The EPA could not be reached for comment.Via: Watchdog.org",left-news,"Aug 17, 2015"
5687, Ted Cruz Holds Hearing On Why Obama Won’t Use The Words He Likes,"Ted Cruz, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Oversight, Agency Action, Federal Rights and Federal Courts, is holding a hearing on radical Islam. This isn t just any hearing on radical Islam, though. It s specifically investigating why President Obama won t use the term  radical Islamic terrorism  when he s talking about radical Islamic terrorism.Seriously.Ted Cruz, a United States Senator, is using Congressional resources, and taking up Congressional time, to investigate words.We wish we were making this up.The hearing s goal is to amp up his message that Obama s refusal to use those specific words has weakened our national security, and the primary accusation is that Obama has been scrubbing the words  radical Islamic terrorism  from public records in order  to pretend the threat doesn t exist. There is a metric ton of right-wing news sites and blogs that pushed a conspiracy theory that Obama censored references to radical Islam from a video of a meeting with French President Francois Hollande, just after the Paris attacks last year. It turns out there was a technical glitch with the recording equipment that dropped the audio at that point in the meeting. As soon as the White House became aware of the problem, they published an updated video with complete audio.Ted Cruz, being the unintelligent, irrational individual we know him to be, would rather waste his subcommittee s time and taxpayer dollars on vapid conspiracy nonsense if it means taking Obama down. The truth is that Obama won t use those specific words because he s trying to isolate ISIS, and terrorists, from the broader Islamic world. He s said: [W]e are not at war with Islam. We are at war with people who have perverted Islam. That is the cold, naked truth that the cowering right won t accept. George W. Bush said the same thing many times throughout his presidency. Here s one example from 2002, not too long after Sept. 11: This great nation of many religions understands, our war is not against Islam, or against faith practiced by the Muslim people. Our war is a war against evil.  [emphasis mine]Ted Cruz, whose brain is the size of a peanut, won t acknowledge that though, because reasons. Others, however, will try to force him to acknowledge it. Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL) did that, saying at the hearing: I have plenty of disagreements with President George W. Bush, but I still marvel that after all we went through [he still pushed us to distinguish between the vast majority of Muslims and a few dangerous extremists]. There s a serious problem when a Democrat can make George W. Bush actually look like a good president. These usurpers of American patriotism not only excel at ignoring pesky things like that, but they also excel at just plain looking foolish. Cruz even had a witness there that went so far as to accuse Reps. Keith Ellison (D-MN) and Andre Carson (D-IN) of having ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, simply because they attended a Muslim event once. Ellison and Carson are the only two Muslims serving in Congress.What can we expect from the man who appointed noted Islamophobe Frank Gaffney, of all people, to his presidential campaign team as a national security adviser, though? Gaffney thinks that Grover Norquist is a secret Muslim; it s hard to take anything he says or does any more seriously than we take the word vomit that spews forth from Donald Trump s mouth.Bottom line: Cruz is pursuing a vendetta of some type against Obama. Either that, or he s desperate to cement his legacy as one of the best Senators we ve ever seen before Obama leaves office. He s only cementing his legacy as an out-of-control loon who complains about big government and wasted money, but has no problem using the government and wasting money to pursue fluff.Featured image by Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,"June 28, 2016"

These two unaccompanied minors, of African origin, were placed in this institution by the social assistance for children department of the local council.But one of the two adolescents apparently was very pressing towards the employee to the point where the young woman, in her 20s, ended up complaining about the sexual harassment she suffered each day.

16891,The Socialists In Venezuela Dealing With A ‘Dead Christmas’ And Food Shortages," We ve reported on the lines for food and shortages of things like toilet paper in Venezuela but this is really sad. The people of the Chavez lead socialist country are suffering so much that they say that  Christmas is Dead  to them. They worry more about food than giving presents Ah, socialism Caracas (AFP)    Christmas is dead,  says Elise Belisario, who, like many Venezuelans, can t afford to hang decorations or make a traditional holiday meal this year.And 2016 augurs bleak times too in this staggering oil giant, where the new year looks set to bring political power struggles and little respite from a crippling economic crisis.Belisario lives in the sprawling slum of Petare, on the outskirts of Caracas, which is suffering this holiday season from the shortages and triple-digit inflation gripping Venezuela   the twin tribulations of the once high-flying economy s demise.Where Christmases past brought exuberant decorations and balconies drenched in lights, this year Petare s streets are drab and dark. There s just not enough money. We ve switched off Christmas,  said Belisario, a 28-year-old with two kids who recently lost her job.When the oil money was flowing, Christmas was a consumer bonanza in Venezuela, a predominantly Catholic country with a flair for celebrations.A woman paints stairs with Christmas colors at the Jose Felix Ribas community in low-income Petare n   But that has changed as oil prices have plunged, and the opulent days under late leftist firebrand Hugo Chavez (1999-2013) have given way to the malaise plaguing his less charmed successor, Nicolas Maduro. We were rich and we didn t even know it,  said Belisario.At a nearby shop, cashier Olga Gonzalez, 50, dejectedly picks up the nearly empty piggy bank she has dressed up in a little Santa Claus suit in hopes of getting some traditional Christmas tips.But there are no customers to leave them. People are more worried about buying food than giving gifts this year,  she said.Exasperated with empty supermarket shelves, runaway prices and violent crime, Venezuelans gave the opposition a landslide victory in legislative elections this month, ending the Chavez movement s 16-year monopoly on power.Via: Yahoo",Government News,"Dec 25, 2015"
21310,BIG FAT LIE Being Told By Lefty Media About Trump Wanting To Register Muslims…He NEVER Said That!,"I just happened to be listening to Rush today and want to pass this on to everyone. Please share this and stop the false story being reported to try and bring down Trump. It s bad enough that the lefty media is trying to take down Trump with big lies, but now it s the establishment Republicans like Kasich who re doing the Trump Trashing. Shame on them!TRANSCRIPT OF RUSH LIMBAUGH EXPLAINING THE BIG LIE TOLD ABOUT TRUMP: RUSH: Now, I don t know if you have seen it yet today. There are stories all over the Drive-By Media   the Associated Press, Yahoo News, I mean, it s everywhere   that Donald Trump supposedly is calling for the registration of all Muslims in America. Trump is demanding that they all be registered and that a massive database be collected. CNN is all over reporting this. Even the Wall Street Journal has picked up on it. There s a problem, though: Trump didn t say it. I m gonna tell you what happened. At a recent public appearance Trump s coming off the stage after one of his usual one hour to 90-minute appearances.He s probably worn out and spent, and there s the usual crowd of autograph seekers and supporters and fans, and amongst them is a Drive-By Media reporter who says to Trump,  Should there be a database system that tracks the Muslims that are in this country?  Trump says,  There should be a lot of systems, beyond databases. We should have a lot of systems, and today you can do it. But right now we have to have a border. We have to have strength, we have to have a wall, and we cannot let what s happening to this country happen again.  Reporter:  Is that something your White House would like to implement? There s no specificity there. The question is just,  Is that something your White House would like to implement?  Trump has given a multifaceted answer. She says,  Is that something,  without specifying what she s asking about. Trump said,  Oh, I would certainly implement that, absolutely,  and that s how they report that Trump  demands a database and registration for all Muslims,  when he didn t say it! He never said it. It s a Journalism 101 trick. It s right out of the manual they teach you at the first year of journalism school in how to destroy political opponents or powerful people you don t like. It s that common a technique.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Now, I m not sure, but I think that the reporter that asked Trump the question and has totally, totally twisted this purposefully to convey something that did not happen, I think the reporter works for Business Insider. I think the reporter is Hunter Walker. If that s who it is, you need to know that this guy is a major backer of Hillary Clinton, as most in the Drive-By Media are. He has written endless articles championing her, and now I think he writes for Yahoo News and is the Business Insider politics editor.So here is how this happened. This is in Newton, Iowa, yesterday after a campaign event. Trump s leaving the stage, and a reporter says,  Should there be a database system to track Muslims in this country?  Now, nobody has suggested that, keep in mind. Trump has not suggested it. So the reporter s not asking a question bouncing off anything Trump has said. It s just a question thrown at Trump, and it comes to him in the midst of autograph seekers and fans and supporters wanting to meet him after his performance is finished.TRUMP: There should be a lot of systems beyond database. We should have a lot of systems. And today you can do it. But right now we have to have a border. We have to have strength. We have to have a wall. And we cannot let what s happening to this country happen.REPORTER: But is it something your White House would like to implement?TRUMP: Oh, I would certainly implement that, absolutely.REPORTER: What do you think the effect of that would be? How would that work?TRUMP: It would stop people from coming in illegally. We have to stop people from coming into our country illegally.REPORTER: Muslims specifically, how do you actually get them registered into a database?TRUMP: It would be just good management. What you have to do is good management procedures. And we can do that.REPORTER: Would you go to mosques and sign these people up into the system?TRUMP: Different places. You sign  em up at different   but it s all about management. Our country has no management.RUSH: Okay. Now, two things about this. The first is, as I said, everybody in the Drive-By Media is running with this because they think they ve got Trump again. They re salivating out there, folks, they are hoping, they ve got their fingers crossed, they ve doubled down, they re putting this story everywhere: Trump sexist, Trump bigoted, Trump anti-Muslim, wants a database; wants to go to their mosques to sign  em up; wants to have them carry around symbols on their clothes to tell everybody who they are. And he never said it.This reporter, Hunter Walker, retweeted the headline from the AP. The AP headline:  Trump Says He Would Absolutely Implement Muslim Database.  This little know-nothing reporter is so proud of his work today. This, as I say, journalism 101. This is what they teach you when you want to take out a political opponent or a powerful person you don t like, this is how you do it, with innuendo.Again, here s what happened. Trump comes offstage,  Should there be a database system that tracks Muslims that are in this country?  It s a setup question from the get-go. Nobody has suggested it. Trump said there should be a lot of systems beyond databases. We should have a lot of systems. And today you can do it, but right now we have to have a border. We have to have strength. We have to have a wall, and we can t let what s happening to this country happen again.He has not confirmed a database. He has not confirmed registration of Muslims. He s changed the question to his favorite subject, the wall and the border and keeping illegal immigrants out. The reporter says,  Is that something your White House would like to implement?  Not specifying. If anything, the guy s talking about the border. The last thing Trump said in his answer was talking about the border, strength, a wall. The reporter says,  Is that something your White House would like to implement?  There is nothing specified. The use of the word  that,  the reporter then can say,  Well, I meant Muslim registration, look what Trump said, Trump knew what I was talking about. But Trump s answer was,  Oh, I would certainly implement that, absolutely. Reporter:  What do you think the effect of that would be? It would stop people from coming in illegally.  Trump s still talking about the border. He s still talking about the wall. He says,  We have to stop people from coming into this country illegally.  So how in the world can Trump be talking about the registration of Muslims or anybody when he s still talking about keeping people out of the country? Muslims are here. This is a good, old-fashioned hatchet job by this low-rent reporter named Hunter Walker who s got everybody in the media reporting it the way he wants because this is what they want people to believe about Trump. This is what they believe about all Republicans. We re bigots, we re racists, sexists and so forth, and Trump s just come along and confirmed it. And I guarantee you there s a contest inside the Drive-By Media to see who can be the one to take Trump out.Here is what they are forgetting. This isn t gonna hurt Trump. Even their journalistic malpractice is not gonna hurt Trump. They haven t figured that out. They keep applying standard, ordinary, everyday tactics on hit pieces to Donald Trump, and all that happens as a result is that Trump increases his support. Trump s support gets stronger. It gets deeper every time they try something like this because Trump is dead serious about protecting this country and its borders and keeping terrorists and so forth out of the country. He makes no bones about it. He s one of the only candidates that s unwavering on it. It s the number one issue.And you combine what s happening with ISIS in Paris and border security, national security, protecting and defending the country and the people who live here is far and away the number one most important issue because everything descends from it. The economy descends from it. Jobs descend from it. Everything that matters descends from this country remaining a country. It has to have a border. That border has to be enforced. Trump s the only guy talking about. They think they ve got him. They re gonna be crying in whatever it is they drink. This is not going to rip the bottom out of Trump s campaign. It s not gonna destroy Trump s campaign no matter how much they re lying, no matter how they try to distort this, because Trump did not say he s in favor of registration or a database of all Muslims in America.And once again, what s gonna happen here is an ever increasingly aware and sophisticated public is gonna just get angrier and angrier at the usual childish tactics of the very unrespected Drive-By Media. Once the public learns what s happened here, the anger is not gonna be at Trump. There wouldn t have been that much anger at Trump anyway among his supporters. That s what they don t understand. You people in the media have got to understand something. You re gonna have to go about this a different way. You didn t make Trump; you can t destroy him. There s nothing you can do. And look at the lengths they re now going to try. Exactly what they did to Romney, by the way. This is no different than Harry Reid saying,  Mitt Romney hasn t paid his taxes in ten years.   Hey, look at Mitt Romney putting the family dog on top of the station wagon.   Hey, Mitt Romney, one of his employees  wives died of cancer, Romney didn t care, went ahead and canceled the health care plan, didn t care. I don t think this guy s questions were even registering with Trump. I think Trump continued to talk with his own framework in mind, meaning his focus on the wall. Because if you continue on with the sound bite   keep in mind here that Trump s never talked about registering or having a database of Muslims. The reporter asks a fake question:  Is that something your White House would do, like to implement?  Trump answers,  Yeah.  He keeps talking about the wall. He keeps talking about the border.  Oh, I would certainly implement that, absolutely.  Trump s still talking about the border.The reporter says,  What do you think the effect of that would be? How would that work? Trump:  It would stop people from coming in illegally.  He s still talking about the border. He s still talking about his wall.  We have to stop people from coming in illegally. Reporter:  For Muslims specifically, how do you actually get them registered in your database?  Trump has never said that he wants to register them in his database. He s talking about the wall. He s talking about the border. This idiot, talentless reporter says,  Well, for Muslims specifically, how do you actually get them registered in your database?  Trump says,  It would be good management. What you have to do is good management procedures, and we can do that.  He s still talking about the wall. He s not even listening to this kid. He s walking out of there, he s answering the question, he s got it answered, he s on the wall, he s on the border, that s what he s talking about.When it s all over the reporter makes it up that Trump s talking about registration of Muslims and a database. Totally makes it up. Anyway, I gotta take a break here. I just wanted you to see this. I wanted you to hear it, the reporter s own words, Trump s own words because it s been picked up everywhere, and, mark my words, the next poll that comes out, Trump s just gonna jump even higher and they re not gonna know what to do with themselves in the Drive-Bys. But you people in the media are gonna have to learn something. When you don t make somebody, you can t destroy him. And you haven t made Trump. The media has nothing to do with why Trump s where he is, and therefore you can t take him out. You can try, you may think you can, but he s got a bond, a connection with his supporters and his audience that you people are not gonna be able to break no matter how hard you try.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: So you know how this works? I just got an e-mail from a friend of mine who plays around on Facebook, and he sent me a screenshot of his Facebook post that he sent out, and he wants me to know that he s on top things. He says,  Yeah, Trump wants to register all Muslims. The last guy that wanted to do that was Hitler with the Jews! Come on, folks! We re going backwards.  So I just had to write him back:  Hey, buddy, you ve got it 180 degrees wrong. Trump didn t say it!  This is a guy that reads the news all day. This is exactly how this happens. You ve got every Drive-By news source now reporting this.originalI m not sure who the reporter was that actually got this whole thing started, but there are the suspects who have taken what that kid did and expanded it are all over the place. You could mention any Drive-By name out there and you d be pretty close to being accurate about who did this. I m not exactly sure who the reporter was at the Trump event. I was told one thing and now I m told that that s not necessarily true. But the guy s name I gave you is still responsible for expanding, amplifying, and leading this. That Hunter Walker is who kicked it all off. Doesn t really matter.I mean, they re all the same stripe, and they ve all got the same objective here. And this e-mail I just got from a friend of mine   who s not an idiot, and you know, he s not a casual consumer of news. It s in the Wall Street Journal. This guy s a financial guy. He read it in the Wall Street Journal, and the Wall Street Journal to these guys is gospel. I have tried to tell every friend of mine, and it s probably gone for naught. I ve tried to tell them just based on the way I get covered, and they know me and they know what s written about me is all bogus. I said,  Could you not apply that to every story you hear, particularly about people you support? Could you just learn to not believe anything you read if it s defaming Republicans in the Drive-By Media? Could you just learn to be suspicious of it and try to confirm it on your own? (sigh) But it doesn t work that way. People believe it.  There it is! It s in print. It s right there,  or,  It s on my screen, Rush! I mean, they can t write stuff that isn t true!  I can t tell you how often I hear that. So Trump s gonna  I don t know how he s gonna deal with this. He will, but  (sigh) Let me  I m gonna go ahead and get in trouble myself here. Can I give you what I think might have happened with a lot of people when they first saw this BS story?What do you think? You re driving around or you re reading or whatever and you hear,  Trump wants to register all Muslims!  (interruption) Yeah. (chuckles) Get my drift? So I m just marveling here. I m thankful for the opportunity. I m thankful I haven t retired. I m thankful I ve still got this program and a chance to come here every day and illustrate the dishonest, the reprehensible, the just scummy way these people work. And each time I see something like this, I focus even more on,  They re not media!  This isn t media! This isn t the news. The media is the Democrat Party. The media is all part of the left-wing establishment that s trying to advance the Democrat Party agenda.Every time I see a story like,  Trump has to fight media here or overcome media,  I ask: Why would you have to overcome the media? The media s just a bunch of journalists telling people what happened who weren t there. (thumps table) Of course, this is the exact opposite. Everybody knows now, or many people. And even people who know what the media is, still get sucked in and believe this stuff. But when you read the transcript of what Trump said, when you actually read it or hear it and then compare it to the news being reported, you can t escape the fact that the media s making it up; that Trump never said it.Read more: Rush Limbaugh",left-news,"Nov 20, 2015"
21043,Germany’s Angela Merkel Makes Incredibly Naive Announcement: EVERY MIGRANT MUST LEAVE…After THIS One Condition Is Met…,"Perhaps Merkel should have considered the serious consequences of Germany s compassionate open border policy that allowed over 1 million (mostly) Muslim males to infiltrate their country. German officials essentially granted them permission to rape and sexually assault their women and children while they looked the other way. But that s not all Germany is giving them free food, housing, education and spending money to boot. Does Angela Merkel really believe that when she tells these freeloading Muslim males that it s time to go back home, that they re going to pack up their bags and leave? As Germany s open-door refugee policy comes increasingly under fire, the Chancellor has tried to silence her critics.Despite mounting pressure to cap the number of refugees in the wake of the Cologne sex attacks which saw 130 women sexually assaulted by men, believed to be migrants, Mrs Merkel has stood her ground.Some 1.1million migrants entered Germany last year, many fleeing conflicts in Syria and Iraq.Mrs Merkel said:  We need   to say to people that this is a temporary residential status and we expect that, once there is peace in Syria again, once ISIS has been defeated in Iraq, that you go back to your home country with the knowledge that you have gained. Mrs Merkel said 70 per cent of the refugees who fled to Germany from former Yugoslavia in the 1990s had returned.She urged other European countries to offer more help  because the numbers need to be reduced even further and must not start to rise again, especially in spring .Speaking to a regional meeting of her Christian Democratic Union (CDU), Mrs Merkel said said all EU states should have an interest in protecting the bloc s external borders, and all would suffer if the internal passport-free Schengen zone collapsed and national borders were closed.Peter Altmaier, who Mrs Merkel has tasked with overseeing the government s handling of the refugee crisis, said the government was negotiating with some countries including Turkey about taking back criminal refugees who arrived via non-EU countries.Yeah because what nation in their right mind wouldn t gladly accept  criminal refugees  into their country? Gee, we sure hope Merkel isn t foolish enough to believe there aren t any members of ISIS living comfortably in refugee housing or camps inside their open-borders.Via: Express UK ",left-news,"Feb 2, 2016"

As the men shout they re called passionate and enthusiastic, whereas Hillary is called hostile, shrill or angry. And as much as even some liberals don t want to admit there s a double-standard, there is, and it s not hard to see if you actually take the time to notice.Appearing on Jimmy Kimmel Live on Thursday night, Kimmel put together a sketch with the former Secretary of State to perfectly simulate what s been happening to Hillary throughout her campaign.Kimmel begins by asking Hillary: I m going to help you win this election no problem. Are you familiar with mansplaining? And Hillary plays it off as though she has no idea what he s talking about, so Kimmel proceeds to  mansplain  pretty much everything that comes out of her mouth.

4558, NRA’s Ted Nugent Unleashes Disgusting Attack On ‘Pathetic’ Unarmed Mass-Stabbing Victims (SCREENSHOTS),"NRA board member, draft-dodger, pedophile, and all-around terrible person Ted Nugent has a message for those  embarrassing  and  pathetic  victims of a recent mass-stabbing at a Minnesota mall   and it s one that no decent person would even consider.On September 17, an attacker apparently affiliated with ISIS stabbed nine people at a mall in St. Cloud, Minnetota. He was eventually fatally shot by an off-duty police officer. Fortunately, the victims  injuries were not life-threatening   something most would celebrate, but Nugent deigns it appropriate to simply attack the victims because they didn t bring their guns to a knife-attack.In one of his traditionally hateful Facebook posts, Nugent unleashed on the victims in exactly the manner one would expect from a man who assumed legal custody of a 17-year-old girl so he could have sex with her. Calling the victims  sad soulless & embarrassing,  Nugent mocked them for being  so pathetic  and  helpless,  remarking that  apparently most Americans like being victims :Previously, Nugent has attacked  losers  who don t carry guns after the mass shooting at Umpqua community College in Oregon last year, blaming them for being victims because they choose not to carry a security blanket firearm around. Nugent falsely claimed that students were not allowed to carry guns on campus because of laws and regulations, but Newsweek reported at the time that the campus was not a  gun-free zone  and that it was  common knowledge  many students were armed. Disarmed and helpless is an irresponsible, suicidal choice that will get you killed,  Nugent disgustingly concluded.  Defend yourself.

17097,Will Your Hometown Be Taking In Obama’s Refugees? Here’s The List Of Cities Where They’re Being Transplanted,"Our friend Ann Corcoran has been exposing the truth about the US State Department s radical Refugee Resettlement Program for years. Finally, America is waking up to this shocking program that brings hundreds of thousands of mostly muslim refugees into our country all supported by our tax dollars Just before the weekend, we learned that out of the fifty states, California, Texas and New York will be getting the largest dump of Muslim  refugees  coming from the Middle East. They are also unscreened Muslims as well. So, if you were wondering if a town near you was going to be a dumping ground for potential jihadists, we ve got a complete list for you.The Obama State Department has released a list of 190 cities in the United States that they will be releasing these unvetted and unscreened Muslim  refugees  into.Ann Corcoran has been covering what is going on and it isn t just the Obama administration who is neglecting their constitutional duties. It s also a Republican-controlled House and Senate.Corcoran writes:Has Congress been shirking its duty for decades?Sure looks like it! Because of the proposals to bring in as many as 100,000 Syrians in the next 12 months, there must be hearings! Come on Trey Gowdy! Come on Bob Goodlatte! Where are you?History tells us that the House (and the Senate) have been shirking their duties under the Refugee Act of 1980 for twenty years!She went on to point out that history:Take a trip down memory lane to the House debate on the  Immigration in the National Interest Act of 1995 (HR2202) spearheaded by Rep. Lamar Smith and see what was said about the  consultation  process and how it has been ignored to America s great detriment.From House Report 104-469 (hat tip: Richard Falknor at Blue Ridge Forum). Report is dated March 4, 1996. Former Democratic Rep. Elizabeth Holtzman who was involved with the passage of the Refugee Act of 1980, as chairman of he immigration subcommittee, is quoted as confirming the importance of the consultation process and Congress  role!The Refugee Act of 1980 intended to provide Congress with a meaningful role in the process of determining refugee admissions. In the words of former Representative Elizabeth Holtzman, then Chair of the House Subcommittee on Immigration, Refugees and International Law,  Importantly, for the first time, the bill requires that Congress be consulted before refugees are admitted, and spells out in detail the elements of that consultation.  55 Additionally, the Report of the House Committee on the Judiciary regarding the Refugee Act of 1980 stated the following: \55\ 125 Cong. Rec. H11966, H1167 (daily ed. Dec. 13, 1979) (statement of Rep. Holtzman).The Committee has made every effort to assure that Congress has a proper and substantial role in all decisions on refugee admissions. In the past, the Attorney General s consultation with this committee regarding admissions has been merely a matter of courtesy or custom. * * * The Committee cannot overemphasize the importance it attaches to consultation. The Congress is charged under the Constitution with the responsibility for the regulation of immigration, and this responsibility continues with respect to refugee admissions.56 \56\ House Report 96-608 at 12-14 (1979).In the past several years, the refugee consultation process has devolved into a single meeting between the Executive Branch and the House and Senate Judiciary Committees near the end of the fiscal year the very type of process which the 1980 Act expressly rejected. As an example, the refugee consultation for fiscal year 1996 occurred in the middle of September 1995 two weeks prior to the beginning of fiscal year 1996. The failure of the Administration to consult with Congress on the number and allocation of refugee admissions until just prior to the beginning of the fiscal year meant that the series of discussions between the President and Congress called for in section 207(d)(1) of the INA did not take place. [This is exactly what is happening right now! ed]The current process of determining refugee admissions does not provide Congress with a meaningful role in this process, as intended in the Refugee Act of 1980. The number of refugee admissions for a particular fiscal year should not be set unilaterally by the President. As former Chairwoman Holtzman stated:  * * * there is no substitute for public scrutiny, public disclosure, public debate on an issue of such importance as the admission of refugees to the United States.  57 The only way to have an adequate public debate on the issue of refugees is to give Congress a more meaningful role in determining number and allocation of refugee admissions. \57\ 125 Cong. Rec. H37203 (daily ed. Dec. 20, 1979).One should not be surprised to find the designated terror group Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) behind trying to move some of these potential jihadists into areas like St. Louis.

10632,FULL TRANSCRIPT AND VIDEO From A Passionate AG Sessions: “Please hear me now…” [Video],"FULL OPENING STATEMENT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL SESSIONS  STATEMENT: It was a very strong and passionate statement from a determined Sessions.FULL TRANSCRIPT:Thank you Chairman Burr and Ranking Member Warner for allowing me to publicly appear before the committee today.I appreciate the Committee s critically important efforts to investigate Russian interference with our democratic process. Such interference can never be tolerated and I encourage every effort to get to the bottom of any such allegations.As you know, the Deputy Attorney General has appointed a special counsel to investigate matters related to Russian interference in the 2016 election. I am here today to address several issues that have been specifically raised before this committee, and I appreciate the opportunity to respond to questions as fully as I am able to do so. But as I advised you, Mr. Chairman, and consistent with long-standing Department of Justice practice, I cannot and will not violate my duty to protect confidential communications with the President.Now, let me address some issues directly: I did not have any private meetings nor do I recall any conversations with any Russian officials at the Mayflower Hotel. I did not attend any meetings at that event. Prior to the speech, I attended a reception with my staff that included at least two dozen people and President Trump. Though I do recall several conversations I had during that pre-speech reception, I do not have any recollection of meeting or talking to the Russian Ambassador or any other Russian officials. If any brief interaction occurred in passing with the Russian Ambassador during that reception, I do not remember it. After the speech, I was interviewed by the news media, which had gathered as I remember in a different room, and then I left the hotel.But whether I ever attended a reception where the Russian Ambassador was also present is entirely beside the point of this investigation into Russian interference with the 2016 campaigns. Let me state this clearly: I have never met with or had any conversations with any Russians or any foreign officials concerning any type of interference with any campaign or election. Further, I have no knowledge of any such conversations by anyone connected to the Trump campaign. I was your colleague in this body for 20 years, and the suggestion that I participated in any collusion or that I was aware of any collusion with the Russian government to hurt this country, which I have served with honor for over 35 years, or to undermine the integrity of our democratic process, is an appalling and detestable lie.Relatedly, there is the assertion that I did not answer Senator Franken s question honestly at my confirmation hearing. That is false. This is how it happened. He asked me a rambling question that included dramatic, new allegations that the United States intelligence community had advised President-elect Trump that  there was a continuing exchange of information during the campaign between Trump s surrogates and intermediaries for the Russian government.  I was taken aback by these explosive allegations, which he said were being reported in breaking news that day. I wanted to refute immediately any suggestion that I was a part of such an activity. I replied,  Senator Franken, I m not aware of any of those activities. I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I didn t have   did not have communications with the Russians, and I m unable to comment on it. That was the context in which I was asked the question, and in that context, my answer was a fair and correct response to the charge as I understood it. It simply did not occur to me to go further than the context of the question and list any conversations I may have had with Russians in routine situations, as I had with numerous other foreign officials.Please hear me now. It was only in March of this year that a reporter asked my spokesperson whether I had ever met with any Russian officials. This was the first time that question had been posed. On the same day, we provided that reporter with the information related to the meeting I and my staff had held in my Senate office with Ambassador Kislyak, as well as the brief encounter in July after a speech that I had given during the convention in Cleveland, Ohio. I also provided the reporter a list of all 25 foreign ambassador meetings I had held during 2016. In addition, I provided supplemental testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee to explain this. I readily acknowledged these two meetings. Certainly nothing improper occurred.Let me also explain clearly the circumstances of my recusal from the investigation into the Russian interference with the 2016 election. I was sworn in as Attorney General on Thursday, February 9th. The very next day, I met with career Department officials, including a senior ethics official, to discuss some things publicly reported in the press and that might have some bearing on the issue of recusal. From that point, February 10th, until I announced my formal recusal on March 2nd, I was never briefed on any investigative details and did not access information about the investigation; I received only the limited information that the Department s career officials determined was necessary to inform my recusal decision. As such, I have no knowledge about this investigation beyond what has been publicly reported, and I have taken no action with regard to any such investigation. On the date of my formal recusal, my Chief of Staff sent an email to the heads of the relevant departments, including by name to Director Comey of the FBI, to instruct them to inform their staffs of this recusal and to advise them not to brief me or involve me in any such matters. And in fact, they have not. Importantly, I recused myself not because of any asserted wrongdoing on my part during the campaign, but because a Department of Justice regulation, 28 CFR 45.2, required it. That regulation states, in effect, that Department employees should not participate in investigations of a campaign if they have served as a campaign advisor.The scope of my recusal, however, does not and cannot interfere with my ability to oversee the Department of Justice, including the FBI, which has an $8 billion budget and 35,000 employees. I presented to the President my concerns, and those of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, about the ongoing leadership issues at the FBI as stated in my letter recommending the removal of Mr. Comey along with the Deputy Attorney General s memorandum, which have been released publicly by the White House. It is a clear statement of my views. It is absurd, frankly, to suggest that a recusal from a single specific investigation would render an Attorney General unable to manage the leadership of the various Department of Justice law enforcement components that conduct thousands of investigations.Finally, during his testimony, Mr. Comey discussed a conversation he and I had about a meeting Mr. Comey had with the President. I am happy to share with the committee my recollection of the conversation I had with Mr. Comey. Following a routine morning threat briefing, Mr. Comey spoke to me and my Chief of Staff. While he did not provide me with any of the substance of his conversation with the President, Mr. Comey expressed concern about the proper communications protocol with the White House and with the President. I responded to his comment by agreeing that the FBI and Department of Justice needed to be careful to follow Department policies regarding appropriate contacts with the White House. Mr. Comey had served in the Department of Justice for the better part of two decades, and I was confident that Mr. Comey understood and would abide by the Department s well-established rules governing any communications with the White House about ongoing investigations. My comments encouraged him to do just that and indeed, as I understand, he did. Our Department of Justice rules on proper communication between the Department and the White House have been in place for years. Mr. Comey well knew them, I thought, and assumed correctly that he complied with them.I will finish with this. I recused myself from any investigation into the campaigns for President, but I did not recuse myself from defending my honor against scurrilous and false allegations. At all times throughout the course of the campaign, the confirmation process, and since becoming Attorney General, I have dedicated myself to the highest standards.The people of this country expect an honest and transparent government and that is what we are giving them. This President wants to focus on the people of this country to ensure they are treated fairly and kept safe. The Trump agenda is to improve the lives of the American people. I know some have other agendas, but that is his agenda and it is one I share.Importantly, as Attorney General I have a responsibility to enforce the laws of this Nation, to protect this country from its enemies, and to ensure the fair administration of justice. I intend to work every day with our fine team and the superb professionals in the Department of Justice to advance the important work we have to do. These false attacks, the innuendo, and the leaks, you can be sure, will not intimidate me.

3363," Conservatives Demand Purge Of LGBT Employees From State Department, And This Is How Trump Replied","Conservatives apparently want a witch hunt in every government department.Earlier this month, Donald Trump s transition team demanded that the Energy Department give them a list of names of employees who study climate change and the labs used to research it. It is assumed that Trump s team wanted the names so they could fire anyone who supports what science already tells us: that climate change is real and humans have contributed to it.Well, the Energy Department told Trump to go f*ck themselves.But now the hate group known as the Family Research Council is calling on Trump to persecute gay employees and any employee who supports LGBT rights within the State Department.In a letter to Trump s team, Tony Perkins whines about how President Obama and Hillary Clinton protected the LGBT community from anti-gay bigots who want to strip them of their human rights.He then complained about how America is offending some nations by hiring gay people. You know, because the Family Research Council is a fan of how Russia persecutes gay people. To carry out this extreme agenda, the Obama administration has systematically filled the ranks of State with LGBTQ and abortion activists,  Perkins wrote before calling for Trump and his team to conduct a witch hunt.  Unless the next secretary of state is willing to resist and remove this embedded agenda, the promotion and protection of true human rights, like religious liberty, will continue to languish. That s right, Perkins wants Trump to be like Joe McCarthy and he doubled down by literally demanding that LGBT people and those who support LGBT rights be  ferreted out  and replaced by anti-gay bigots.It s for this reason that I have raised concerns about the nomination of ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson for secretary of state. I certainly don t see Tillerson cut from the same cloth as Clinton or Kerry, but he doesn t have to be for these anti-life, liberal social policies to continue. He must have the courage to stop the promotion of this anti-family, anti-life agenda, which is very much a question mark given that he capitulated to activists pushing to liberalize the Boy Scouts  policy on homosexuality when he was at the helm of the organization.The incoming administration needs to make clear that these liberal policies will be reversed and the  activists  within the State Department promoting them will be ferreted out and will be replaced by conservatives who will ensure the State Department focuses on true international human rights like religious liberty which is under unprecedented assault.But Donald Trump was in no mood for Perkins  hate and sent a strong message delivered by Trump spokesman Jason Miller that discrimination will not be tolerated. President-elect Trump campaigned on a message of unity in order to bring all Americans together. To think that discrimination of any kind will be condoned or tolerated in a Trump Administration is simply absurd. In other words, Perkins can go f*ck himself.Now, this doesn t mean that we should trust that Trump will keep to his word. After all, he has repeatedly flip-flopped through his campaign and ever since the election. But it should be noted that Trump sent a similar message to anti-bigots last month. After being asked about marriage equality, Trump told 60 Minutes that same-sex marriage has been settled by the courts and that he s  fine with that. So for now, at least Trump is being consistent when it comes to LGBT right. Conservatives must be furious.Featured Image: Sara D. Davis/Getty Images",News,"December 18, 2016"
14311,DEMOCRAT LAWMAKER WILL BE PUNISHED For Putting Jobs Before “Climate Change”: “They are after me”,"Tow the party line or pay a heavy price. There is no room for dissention in a party where thugs who cut backroom deals with climate change related lobbyists in DC dictate what is best for America. There s probably a very good reason that the Democrats have an avowed Socialist and a career criminal running neck in neck in their presidential primaries In a shocking exchange on Wednesday, Attorney General Loretta Lynch and Loony Liberal Senator Sheldon Whitehouse discussed whether the DOJ had considered civil action against climate change deniers. This tells you just how out of control this DOJ is. If you don t buy into the climate change scam then you will be punished. That s fine if you live in San Francisco and can afford a Tesla,  said Husing.  It s not fine if you re a poor family living in downtown San Bernardino   and the folks that stopped that deserve a welcome thanks. What happens when a Democratic lawmaker strays from party leaders on a key piece of Gov. Jerry Brown s policy agenda? One assemblywoman who held back support for a sweeping climate-change bill last year is starting to find out.Rep. Cheryl Brown (D-San Bernardino) was among a group of business-aligned Democrats who objected to a provision in the bill, SB 350, that would have cut California s motor vehicle petroleum use in half by 2030.Now Brown, a moderate, is facing what could be a bruising reelection fight against an intraparty challenger from the left, attorney Eloise Gomez Reyes. The race raises a question: What does it mean to be a Democrat in San Bernardino, where concerns over jobs often compete with those about the environment?Some early signs indicate Brown could be in trouble. Protesters have showed up at her local events. Some of her supporters have defected, endorsing Reyes early in the fight. Do you ever feel that something is not going quite right?  Brown said in a recent phone interview.  They are after me, and I still don t know why. I don t know who  they  are. But I will find out soon. Last week, Brown s suspicions began to crystallize when a dozen students in breathing masks from San Bernardino Valley College threw themselves on the floor of a town hall meeting she hosted.Brown was there to discuss the region s logistics industry and its vast network of trucking and distribution centers, which deliver everything from headphones to heads of lettuce to big-box retailers and Amazon customers throughout Southern California.At the event, Brown supporter John Husing, an economist with the Inland Empire Economic Partnership, discussed SB 350 s scrapped petroleum provision, which was removed after Brown and other Democrats objected to its inclusion. Husing came to Brown s aid, arguing that lower-income families might have been harmed by potential rising energy costs that may have resulted from implementation of the provision. That s fine if you live in San Francisco and can afford a Tesla,  said Husing.  It s not fine if you re a poor family living in downtown San Bernardino   and the folks that stopped that deserve a welcome thanks. A group of twenty-somethings interrupted him, calling Brown  a corporate hack.  They held up signs that read  People over Profits  and  Don t Sell Us Out.  Via: LA Times",politics,"Mar 13, 2016"

The hate for all things Trump was visible in scorching comments from snowflakes:Yes, there were comments about the nativity scene too. The Hill commented on the nativity scene being included in Trump s first White House Christmas.

A report that appeared in the New York Times  fashion section that made reference to the Obamas planning a  non-secular Christmas  is behind those rumors.The original report was about Desir e Rogers, a  glamorous corporate executive from Chicago,  joining the Obama White House as social security. In that role, Rogers would orchestrate White House special events and celebrations. Rogers mentioned the Obamas were discussing a  non-secular Christmas  display at the White House during an introductory luncheon:The lunch conversation inevitably turned to whether the White House would display its cr che, customarily placed in a prominent spot in the East Room. Ms. Rogers, this participant said, replied that the Obamas did not intend to put the manger scene on display   a remark that drew an audible gasp from the tight-knit social secretary sisterhood.

3359, WATCH: Van Jones Takes Trump To The Woodshed For Unpatriotic Response To Russia Hack,"Donald Trump s desperate effort to make people ignore the fact that Russia helped him win the election runs contrary to American values and Van Jones ripped him for it.During a panel discussion on CNN this Sunday about Trump s reaction to Russian interference with our political process, Jones chimed in with a searing takedown. This is baffling to anybody with a functioning brain stem,  Jones began.  We have to be honest about this. Indeed, the CIA and 17 intelligence agencies along with the FBI all agree that Russia launched a cyber attack against our political institutions with one of the goals being to help Trump beat Hillary Clinton.Now Vladimir Putin will have a puppet in the White House for the next four years who refuses to condemn Russia because it would acknowledge that he is illegitimate. Yes, other presidents have tried to say nice things about the Russians,  Jones continued.  Not in the face of an active attack on the country! It s true. Past presidents have made attempts to be friendly toward Russia, but Trump is doing so after our intelligence community just concluded that Russia committed espionage, which is an act of war, against our country. But Trump is defending Russia instead. Cyber war is real war,  Jones explained.  So you have an active attack on our country and you have the president-elect who cannot find in himself to say this is wrong and it needs to stop. Jones pointed out that Trump has responded personally and as a partisan to attacks, but has demonstrated an unwillingness to respond as a patriot to an attack on our nation s sacred election infrastructure. This is an attack on our country!  Jones said in conclusion.  And I just think that everybody sitting here trying to pretend this is normal, this is not normal and it s dangerous. Here s the video via YouTube.Donald Trump recently demanded that China return a United States Navy drone they seized in the South China Sea. He s more upset about that than the attack on our democracy perpetrated by Russia.

23001,FAKE NEWS WEEK: Mainstream Media – All the Fake News That’s Fit to Print," In response to the establishment media s contrived  fake news  crisis designed to marginalise independent and alternative media sources of news and analysis, 21WIRE is running its own #FakeNewsWeek awareness campaign, where each day our editorial team at 21st Century Wire will feature media critiques and analysis of mainstream corporate media coverage of current events   exposing the government and the mainstream media as the real purveyors of  fake news  throughout modern history   SARTRE 21st Century WireUnderstanding the complex relationships that make up human endeavors permeates every aspect of society and politics. The ability to be informed about events is a basic motivation to search out news about what is exactly happening in the world we all live in. Journalism purports to report the first draft of history. In practice, the press and media coverage is systemically bereft of relevant facts and completely void of objectivity. The currency of the realm is trust for all journalists. Their collective credibility is bankrupt for a very simple reason; their newscasts are based upon lies, newspeak and intentional deception.Carlin Romano in We Need  Philosophy of Journalism , asks an essential question that is not at all addressed by the Fourth Estate:  How can it be that journalism and philosophy, the two humanistic intellectual activities that most boldly (and some think obnoxiously) vaunt their primary devotion to truth, are barely on speaking terms? Essentially, every component of the mainstream media multiplex is foremost a business. The business model is to operate under the aegis of monopolies. Even a casual observation of the interlocking ownership of big media must acknowledge that the concentration of likeminded Oligopolists are in unison to construct a consortium of predisposed narratives that has nothing to do with seeking the truth.When the term Pressitude is used to characterize the profession, the uninformed or limited literate news consumers often find comfort in turning on their network disinformation program. Those who take pride in obtaining their news from  papers of record  like the New York Times and the Washington Post rely upon a different motivation. Their aversion to any source that contradicts the establishment worldview is so painful to consider that they adopt a feeble rationalization for self-preservation, which demands rejection of any argument, verifiable facts or documented evidence that challenges their scripted storyline of reality.The example of Sharyl Attkisson, and Judith Miller, have been treated differently by their own employers. The first demonstrating courageous investigative reporting; whereas the second produced a fabricated account that deceived the public about nonexistent WMDs in Iraq. Attkisson was ostracized, while Miller is now a FOX News contributor.Miller s Pulitzer Prize, awarded while employed by the NYT   is no badge of honor. The term  Yellow Journalism  is most closely associated with Joseph Pulitzer and William Randolph Hearst. Their sensational duelling newspapers and extra editions shared the  Fake News  prototype during the late 19th century and early 20th century. What once was conveyed by a cartoon image is now a 24/7 cable news cycle. Granted, the 21st century is different, but the spin and outright lies follow the same pattern of misinformation. Deception, falsification and distortion are absorbed as nonchalantly as a My Pillow advertisement that inundates the propaganda that masquerades as news.The orthodox version of American media journalism was crafted under the guidance of William S. Paley of CBS, setting the highest standard for news reporting at that time. Names like Edward R. Murrow, Elmer Davis, William L. Shirer, Charles Collingwood, Howard K. Smith and Eric Sevareid are icons in the industry. For those who contend that this era invented  The most trusted man in America  Walter Cronkite, one must not forget that the broadcast news division ran budget deficits, while the parent network was most profitable. Yet for all the celebrated accolades that CBS News coveted, the underlying message behind the script was Edward Bernays  propaganda. Fast forward to the internet age and you find that these one-time news bureaus no longer control their monopoly over the news cycle.Immediacy in information dissemination no longer guarantees accuracy in the report anymore than corporatist editing ensures the believability of the popularly accepted viewpoint. Nevertheless, the predominant originator of  Fake News  comes from a far more sinister source; government brainwashing. Indeed, at the very core of vast news media apparatus are state-sponsored operatives and embeds. Any pretense that there is any independence within establishment media outlets is a symptom of the chronic idiocy within the popular culture. Inserting the government fake news version, using unreliable sources to shape an echo chamber of official fiction is the paradigm for mass indoctrination. Controlling gatekeepers to filter out any conflicting accounts uses both covert and overt censorship. The flagship news purveyors devote their resources to discredit genuine freelance reporting from any ideological perspectives. Mainstream Media (MSM) has the mission to smear any alternative news source and label them as disrepute journalists.The American Press Institute states that Journalism s first obligation is to the truth. Then refines this criterion by adding conditionality to the standard:  Journalism does not pursue truth in an absolute or philosophical sense, but in a capacity that is more down to earth. By inserting a subjective value element, any reasonable expectation that the work product is trustworthy is suspect. It becomes the task of the reader or viewer to critically analyze the underlying bias and intention to inculcate the culture.  When Marshall McLuhan coined the phrase,  The medium is the message,  he was foreseeing the extent of the newspeak affixed within the medium was not fully appreciated.Corporations select journalists for their adherence to nihilism in reporting. The MSM s denial of objective facts and practicing deception by generating actual fake news has produced generations of na ve, ill-informed and confused souls   placing a purdah veil over the heads of trendy clones, fostering the shearing of the sheeple society.Escaping this planet of press corps apes requires a withdrawal from the sophism. The coordinated accusations of  Fake News  attacks by the dinosaur media upon autonomous internet reporting is a sure sign that suppressing truth to power is the only storyline that matters to these secular relativists and muckraking crusaders to maintain their stranglehold on headline sound bites.The selection agenda which determines what constitutes news is an editorial function that bears witness to the parameters for public conditioning. All other reporting is declared as  conspiracy theory.  Even a casual assessment of the foreign press provides a contrast to the perception spin machine from K Street or Madison Avenue. As the monopoly media manipulation resorts to their faux news narrative, astute observers understand that their broadcast lies are the real Fake News.*** Author SARTRE is a special contributor to 21st Century Wire.

7486, Humans Of New York Photographer PUMMELS Donald Trump In Scathing Open Letter (IMAGE),"Brandon Stanton, the world-renowned photographer behind the brilliant Humans of New York  Facebook page, usually stays out of politics but this particular election has him all riled up thanks to Republican front runner Donald Trump.Knowing full well that the rise of the business mogul could be the absolute downfall of America, Stanton decided that he could no longer stay silent and penned an open letter to Trump on Monday.  The photographer shot to fame six years ago by photographing people on the streets, documenting and sharing a small piece of their lives with the public. Since then, his popularity has grown tremendously and Stanton has photographed and interviewed notable figures such as President Barack Obama and Syrian refugees   using his tremendous influence to make a statement. Stanton s letter to Trump is no different, but carries an entirely different tone as the photographer has labeled the offensive candidate  hateful  and  racist. First admitting that he was hesitant to become involved in the election, Stanton explained why he was choosing to speak out against the front runner now: I try my hardest not to be political. I ve refused to interview several of your fellow candidates. But I realize now that there is no correct time to oppose violence and prejudice. Because along with millions of Americans, I ve come to realize that opposing you is no longer a political decision. It is a moral one. In the letter, Trump was also called out for the racism and violence that he encourages not only in his Twitter rants, speeches and interviews, but at his rallies as well. I ve watched you retweet racist images. I ve watched you retweet racist lies. I ve watched you take 48 hours to disavow white supremacy. I ve watched you joyfully encourage violence, and promise to  pay the legal fees  of those who commit violence on your behalf. Stanton also spoke about the people he s gotten to interview around the world   such as Muslims in Iran, Iraq, and Pakistan, and Syrian and Iraqi refugees   the very people that Trump warns his supporters about. Stanton blasts the GOPer for comparing refugees to  snakes , claiming that  Islam hates us and  gleefully tell stories of executing Muslims with bullets dipped in pig blood.  The photographer railed against Trump s hateful rhetoric and lies: Over the last two years I have conducted extensive interviews with hundreds of Muslims, chosen at random, on the streets of Iran, Iraq, and Pakistan. I ve also interviewed hundreds of Syrian and Iraqi refugees across seven different countries.And I can confirm  the hateful one is you. Stanton ends his scathing letter by saying that even if Trump changed his tone, he will never be able to truly  rebrand  himself as  presidential  or a  unifier    because he s not. Stanton wrote: Though your words will no doubt change over the next few months, you will always remain who you are. You are a man who has encouraged prejudice and violence in the pursuit of personal power. The post has now been shared over 590,000 times, and you can read it in full below:HONYStanton s message is such a powerful one, and a reminder of what Trump truly stands for.

6704," ‘Big Government Tyranny’ Once Again Saves Ted Cruz’s Beloved Texas, Obama Approves Disaster Aid","Texas Sen. Ted Cruz is busy criss-crossing the nation to spread his message of small government fanaticism, but his own state just got a lesson in why the federal government isn t just important, it can be lifesaving.While Cruz spent his time making offensive jokes about trans people this week, Texas has been hit with a horrific run of severe weather. Many areas of the state, particularly in Harris County, have seen their homes and jobs literally washed away in major flooding. The severe weather, which saw parts of major cities like Houston and Austin go underwater, is estimated to cost over $5 billion.Cruz, whose typical response to tragedy involves tweeting  thoughts and prayers  to the victims, has offered little else. Meanwhile, President Obama and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) have gotten to work. This week, Obama approved federal disaster relief funding to the parts of Texas affected by the flooding.Federal assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the disaster. The presidential disaster declaration, which includes all of Harris County, allows FEMA and other federal agencies to begin providing relief to individuals affected by this most recent flood. Harris County continues to work with local nonprofit and volunteer organizations to provide immediate relief,  said Harris County Judge Ed Emmett.Cruz, of course, famously voted against giving similar aid to New Jersey after Hurricane Sandy (which may explain why New Jersey Governor Chris Christie wanted nothing to do with endorsing Cruz for president). His logic was that states should be left on their own, and federal aid was little more than government overreach. Citing the potential aid package s extra funding for other government projects   a standard procedure   Cruz said at the time: This bill is symptomatic of a larger problem in Washington   an addiction to spending money we do not have. The United States Senate should not be in the business of exploiting victims of natural disasters to fund pork projects that further expand our debt. Some of the  pork projects  included funding scientific research into extreme weather events that scientists had hope to be able to help states avoid future disasters. Or as Cruz calls it  wasteful spending. Despite Cruz s adherence to strict  no hand outs  when it came to other states, Texas being a massive state with tens of millions of people and lots of potential disasters has always stuck out its own hand when it came time for help.The recent onslaught of floods in Texas come at a bad time for Cruz politically. It certainly undermines his nearly pathological aversion to the federal government. It might be just the thing to remind people that Ted Cruz infamously shut down the very government that they are now counting on to help them rebuild after a horrific natural disaster.

22536,"MISSING DETAILS: Orlando Shooting 911 Transcripts Questioned, Survivor’s Story Challenged","Shawn Helton 21st Century Wire The FBI have finally released the written transcripts from shooter Omar Mateen s supposed 911 call   and now apparently unredacted. Meanwhile, another story of survival at Pulse nightclub is called into question.Will this tell us anything new about this event, or will it just prompt even more questions? NIGHT OF TERROR?   A serene setting following the Orlando shooting attack on June 11th (Image Source: twitter)Shaky Storyline, Missing DetailsWhile the focus on Orlando shooter Omar Mateen s 911 transcripts is over what was included and what was not, and while the national media argue endlessly over the need for more gun control in the US   the most important aspect of the FBI supplied transcript seems to have gone virtually unnoticed. There s no discussion of an actual shooting occurring inside of the Pulse nightclub.While the report has a basic outline of  America s largest mass shooting  it fails to account for any of the shootings said to have occurred within the Pulse nightclub, with no mention of individuals being shot at or reportedly shot at in the FBI s official narrative. It s as if they just left out the biggest piece of the puzzle.This has become an all to common theme, as media press conference rituals shape a narrative within the first hours of a mass casualty event and even if that story turns out to be mostly false, the media runs with it anyway, whether or not law enforcement information and crime scene analysis belies the original narrative pushed by media. The most clear example of this happened during the aftermath of the WTC 1993 bombing, where major media outlets exposed it as an FBI run sting with their operators in control   yet still, media anchors called it an al-Qaeda led attack.So when you consider what happened in Orlando, one should question the lack of shooting details- why is this aspect of the story left open for interpretation when every other part of the official timeline appears to be accounted for?While the media conveniently overlook this important detail, the implications of this could be very significant in determining who shot who, and when.Interestingly, the description of the Orlando shooting even includes mention of the Orlando Police Department pulling an air conditioning unit out of a Pulse  dressing room  to evacuate victims, a multi-call crisis negotiation, the alleged shooter s outrageous claims of a  bomb-laced vest  and authorities breaching the back wall of the nightclub with an explosive charge   and yet, no mention of additional shots fired at patrons inside the club?Here s a portion of the FBI s summary of events that excludes any mention of shots fired within the interior of the club itself: Based on OPD radio communications, there were no reports of shots being fired inside Pulse between the initial exchange of gunfire between responding officers and shooter, and the time of the final breach. During this time, the shooter communicated with an OPD 911 operator and an OPD crisis negotiator, and OPD radio communications reported that victims were being rescued. Here s a more basic chronology of the Orlando shooting, as told by the FBI: 2:02 a.m.: OPD call transmitted multiple shots fired at Pulse nightclub. 2:04 a.m.: Additional OPD officers arrived on scene. 2:08 a.m.: Officers from various law enforcement agencies made entrance to Pulse and engaged the shooter. 2:18 a.m.: OPD SWAT (Special Weapons and Tactics) initiated a full call-out. 2:35 a.m.: Shooter contacted a 911 operator from inside Pulse.3:03 a.m.: Second crisis negotiation call occurred lasting approximately 16 minutes. 3:24 a.m.: Third crisis negotiation call occurred lasting approximately three minutes.4:21 a.m.: OPD pulled an air conditioning unit out of a Pulse dressing room window for victims to evacuate.4:29 a.m.: As victims were being rescued, they told OPD the shooter said he was going to put four vests with bombs on victims within 15 minutes.5:02 a.m.: OPD SWAT and OCSO Hazardous Device Team began to breach wall with explosive charge and armored vehicle to make entry.5:14 a.m.: OPD radio communication stated that shots were fired. 5:15 a.m.: OPD radio communication stated that OPD engaged the suspect and the suspect was reported down. The Orlando shooting details state multiple shots [were] fired at Pulse nightclub at 2:02 am, as Additional OPD officers arrived on scene,  at 2:04 am, with law enforcement engaging the shooter at 2:08 am   there is no other mention of shots fired until police exchange fire with the alleged suspect after breaching the wall at 5:15 am.Question: Would it really be possible for Mateen to have accurately shot over 100 people, take hostages and engage in a fire fight with officers in just a 6 minute time frame?This scenario is hardly likely, if not impossible.Additionally, what happened during the apparent crisis negotiation from 3:24 am to 4:21 am, why have the FBI chosen not to elaborate on those details?Matten s weapons of choice during the apparent attack were a Sig Sauer MCX .223 caliber rifle and a Glock 17 9mm semi-auto pistol    and according to the official story, was far more accurate than most well-trained law enforcement agents, defying statistical averages as examined by the Rand Corporation.Let s take another look at the extensive Rand study involving the NYPD, here are the following statistics as it relates they firearm accuracy: According to a 2008 Rand Corporation study evaluating the New York Police Department s firearm training, between 1998 and 2006, the average hit rate during gunfights was just 18 percent . When suspects did not return fire, police officers hit their targets 30 percent of the time.Another aspect of the Orlando shooting attack was the possibility that many club goers could have been injured by authorities, something that also seemed to be absent from the official story. Here s a passage from WFAA8, an ABC affiliate discussing this point: Orlando Police Chief John Mina and other law enforcement officers offered new details about the shooting, including the possibility that some victims may have been killed by officers trying to save them. I will say this, that s all part of the investigation,  Mina said.  But I will say when our SWAT officers, about eight or nine officers, opened fire, the backdrop was a concrete wall, and they were being fired upon. Police also used an explosive charge and a Bearcat armored vehicle to breach the wall as civilians were allegedly holed up in a bathroom. This has led some critics to consider the possibility that non-combatants could have become collateral damage during the SWAT siege at Pulse.Political Fallout & Media EngineeringAlso of note regarding the Orlando shooting event, was the obvious attempt to ramrod new ready-made gun legislation (struck down just two days ago)   just over a week after the incident.Back in November of 2012, it was reported that the White House, along with other Democrats were already busy rewriting old gun-ban legislation just prior to the Sandy Hook shooting. The Assault Weapons Ban and Law Enforcement Protection Act of 2007, otherwise known as H.R. 1022 of the 110th Congress, it introduced an early list of gun-bans and restrictions but was dropped due to lack of public support. A similar set of laws failed after the Oregon campus shooting in 2015.While big media has been busy trying to sell the public on the most tragic shooting in America. They ve also been attempting to fill in a series of unexplainable blanks by seemingly re-writing the Orlando narrative, with a wave of contradictory information. In essence, the corporate media has boiled down two choices in the motive for the Orlando Pulse nightclub shooting   suggesting it s either a hate crime or terrorism.And since then it s become problematic to blend certain elements of the official story in the Orlando shooting case, prompting Attorney General Loretta Lynch to state the motive may never be known in the alleged crime   after key aspects of the 911 transcript were redacted and a decision was made to block audio from the 911 call.No motive, no audio, redacted transcripts and conflicting reports of the shooting, isn t that convenient.The whole episode immediately recalls the much fabled death of Bin Laden and the political and media fiasco that followed the Abbotabad raid in Pakistan   all of which failed to reveal any real forensic evidence, as President Obama withheld post-mortem images of Bin Laden, including  video  of the sea burial of the purported terror leader.The fact is, none of the media s grandstanding or politicized hyperbole has offered anything in terms of actual evidence   as the public has been deliberately steered towards multiple storylines   while politicians go through another gun control/gun reform ritual on the Senate floor.  QUIET EMERGENCY?    A calm scene at Orlando Regional Medical Center hospital prior to apparent Pulse nightclub victims arriving for medical attention. (Image Source: twitter)Orlando s Staged Elements & False ClaimsRecently here at 21WIRE, we discussed much of the corporate media s theatrical depiction of the Orlando shooting and the widespread characterization of the event, which has been reduced to two categories   that of a  lone gunman  and a saddened community centered on the sociopolitical ramifications of the incident, rather than an in-depth forensic analysis of the alleged crime itself.In addition, we outlined some of the various Hollywood and media connections observed in the aftermath of the apparent Orlando shooting attack, as it was revealed that the world s largest security firm G4S, who had employed the man named in the Orlando pulse nightclub shooting, Omar Mateen  is also client of the mass casualty and crisis actor staging company called CrisisCast.As if that wasn t enough, we re also now being told that alleged Pulse nightclub  survivor  Clint Lampkin s account of the shooting has been called into question by media. The following is a YouTube clip from Wochit news reviewing the inconsistencies found by the CBS-affiliated television station WHNT-TV The following was released by FOX6 on June 21st, examining WHNT-TV s findings over the weekend that have since been removed from the network s website: On Saturday, hundreds of people in Alabama were captivated by an impromptu speech by Clint Lampkin, a man who claimed to be a survivor of the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando. I was in the bar when it all happened,  Lampkin told the crowd at the Rocket City Pride Memorial Service in Huntsville.  It s been hard on me  seeing people get shot. Lampkin said the hate he witnessed first-hand is still overwhelming. It s really strong. I mean not just for my friend but all the others that lost their lives. It s hard you know. It really is. It s really sad,  Lampkin says.Continuing, the recently published article outlined the contradictory nature of Lampkin s comments made during a memorial service and a Facebook post on his personal account on the morning after the shooting:(Left side screen shot of Lampkin s strange comment after the Orlando attack) But now, Lampkin s story is being called into question.One of Lampkin s Facebook friends sent WHNT a screenshot of one of Lampkin s Facebook posts from June 12, which shows he shared the story about the shooting and wrote:  Glad I wasn t at that one. Lampkin told WHNT his Facebook account was  hacked  and that he never made that post. He still claims he was at the Pulse Nightclub the night of the shooting. I have really bad anxiety attacks, so I just kinda, I don t know, my mind is just gone,  he told WHNT.WHNT asked for other details surrounding the night of the shooting, and Lampkin gave the same response   that the trauma he witnessed has somehow erased his memory and made it difficult to remember the name of the friend who was allegedly shot dead: I did lose a friend that got shot,  he told the crowd on Saturday. WHNT asked Lampkin for the name of his friend who died inside the club. He answered that he had only known each other for a short time and didn t remember the victim s name.  Lampkin s Facebook profile states that he s an associate at Tobacco Warehouse and a cashier at Arby s. CEO of Free2Be and organizer of the Rocket City Pride Memorial Service, James Robinson, has subsequently fielded calls claiming Lampkin s story is untrue.This again has become another unexplained and unresolved aspect in the Orlando shooting event.Rehearsal Drills Train the PublicThe staging of inter-agency drills often precedes an area stricken by a tragic event. Here at 21WIRE, we ve documented a number of drills taking place in the days, months, years, in a nearby city leading up to a dramatic mass casualty incident.As we previously reported Orlando s Orange County had been running a number of  mass casualty  drills in recent years.As stated before, these emergency response drills often take place prior to a real-life active-shooter scenario. The Orlando Sentinel reported the drill on October 2nd, 2015, one day after the Oregon shooting, an event that also saw drills prior to a shooting at Umpqua Community College. Here s a passage of the Sentinel s report: During the Emergency Nurses Association s annual meeting on Friday, a mock shooter blew himself up, killing and injuring 100 local volunteer actors. There was blood, screams and moans, wounds and dead people   all fake   to create a realistic training environment for more than 40 nurses who had signed up for the exercise.They quickly began tending to  patients,  assessing the extent of their injuries. The  NBC-affiliated WESH2 in Orlando stated that  Nurses attending to mock patients knew they were in for a drill, but they had no idea it would be a mass casualty/active shooter test. Was the Pulse nightclub shooting a drill gone live, with both real and unreal elements?  HEAVY MAKE-UP    In another plot twist, an alleged ex-lover of Mateen s named  Miguel  has re-energized the hate crime narrative pushed by media.(Image Source: xaluan)According left-leaning latin American broadcast TV outlet Univision: Omar Mateen, the Muslim gunman who committed the Pulse nightclub massacre in Orlando, was  100 percent  gay and bore a grudge against Latino men because he felt used by them, according to a man who says he was his lover for two months. I ve cried like you have no idea. But the thing that makes me want to tell the truth is that he didn t do it for terrorism. In my opinion he did it for revenge,  he told Univision Noticias anchor Maria Elena Salinas in an exclusive interview in English and Spanish on Tuesday. He said Mateen was angry and upset after a man he had sex with later revealed he was infected with the HIV virus.Asked why he decided to come forward with his story, he said:  It s my responsibility as a citizen of the United States and a gay man. The man said he had approached by the FBI and been interviewed three times in person by agents. Univision was unable to independently verify his account. The FBI confirmed to Univision that it had met with him. Suddenly, the alleged shooter Omar Mateen is a gay lover scorned, and not an ISIS-inspired terrorist? Note here that  Miguel  could be seen wearing a very expensive, complex Hollywood-level make-up facade, and one could easily deduce here that  Miguel  is an actor of sorts, if not a professional.It should also be noted that Univision, who collaborate heavily with CNN on a number of sensational and politicized stories, led the way in spoiling the crime scene of the alleged shooter Omar Mateen s apartment in Orlando   accessing his property and fiddling with the suspects belongs on camera only days after the Pulse nightclub event. This media segment was clearly staged, not least of all because at that time law enforcement announced they were conducting a  terrorism  and mass-murder investigation. If that were the case, then the suspect s home would have been classed as a crime scene and its contents considered as evidence.Judging by Univision s immediate media access to the property, it should be fairly obvious, as it was after the exact same San Bernardino media fiasco last December, that the apartment would not have been deemed a real crime scene in an international or domestic terrorism investigation. Watch: For over a week, the public has been drip fed information about the Orlando shooting attack   much of which has led to even more questions. To major media, the event is all but a forgone conclusion tightly wrapped up with all the fear-inducing talking points on both the left and right side of the political aisle without clearly looking at the alleged crime itself.In fact it seems, that the media has sought to draw the viewer away from the incomplete Pulse nightclub story line, a narrative that as of yet   has failed to explain the connection of a crisis staging company (CrisisCast) to that of the alleged shooter s security company (G4S), as well as many Hollywood/acting/media connections discovered, such as Luis Burbano, Shawn Royster Santiago, Patience Carter, Omar Mateen, Francesca Hunt and Brian Mitchell   add to that, those who witnessed multiple shooters or any shooting within the interior of the nightclub, in addition to the mismatched tweets and Facebook posts that displayed inaccurate time frames or cult of personality types such as Clint Lampkin, whose story just doesn t add up.We re now told that the FBI is continuing to build a timeline of Mateen s whereabouts before the attack, stating he paid for entry at Pulse then subsequently disappeared for a two-hour period between when he left the club and returned. It s anyone s guess what will be next in the Orlando shooting story.END OF PART 3Stay tuned for more Orlando shooting updates SEE ALSO: CASTING CRISIS: Orlando s Actors, Agents and Casualty Role PlayersREAD MORE ORLANDO SHOOTING NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Orlando FilesHelp support us by becoming a 21WIRE Member at: 21WIRE.TV",US_News,"June 22, 2016"

The brilliance of this video is the narration by Detroit s Democrat Mayor Duggan. He revisits the tired old  hope and change  that we all heard 8 years ago, only this time, Hillary s going to fix it. There are no jobs in Detroit. The manufacturing has been shipped overseas. There is little hope in the city of Detroit, because every time the city gets a large infusion of cash, someone from the Democrat Party is there to mismanage the money or use it in ways it was never intended to be used. Of course, we in the suburbs continue to bail out the schools and bail out those who can t (or won t) pay their water bills.  Meanwhile, principals and anyone who has access to Detroit school funds are stealing the from money designated for the kids, while stories of corruption by city officials (all Democrats) barely get a blip in the local news.Here s the real  comeback city  our Democrat Mayor wants you to believe Hillary gives a damn about: ",left-news,"Aug 1, 2016"
709, Maxine Waters Reveals The REAL Reason Pence Is Putting Up With Trump’s Madness,"Donald Trump becomes more unhinged by the day. The week we just witnessed is his craziest yet. First, there was the hyper-partisan, free-wheeling speech he gave to a bunch of children at the Boy Scouts  Jamboree. The speech outraged so many people that the Boy Scouts of America had to apologize. Then, while speaking in front of police officers in Long Island, New York, Trump openly endorsed and encouraged police brutality in a racist speech sure to fire up his mouthbreathing base. And of course, there was the ouster of White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus via Twitter, who he humiliated as he was pushed out the door. To top it all off, he called for banning transgender soldiers from the military without even telling the Pentagon and the Joint Chiefs of Staff first. This major, sweeping policy change was also made via Twitter.Through all of this madness, there were, of course, Trump s repeated and sustained attacks on his own Attorney General, Jeff Sessions. Even though this should have Republicans reeling with outrage, and some Capitol Hill Republicans have fired warning shots at Trump about Sessions, there is one person who has been suspiciously silent throughout the chaos: Mike Pence, Trump s second-in-command.Well, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) thinks she knows the reason for that. Taking to Twitter on Saturday evening, Rep. Waters said what anyone watching is likely thinking: Pence is just riding out the Trump insanity until the Republicans on Capitol Hill finally decide they ve had enough, and they pull the trigger on Trump. This, of course, would make Pence President. Here is that tweet:Mike Pence is somewhere planning an inauguration. Priebus and Spicer will lead the transition.  Maxine Waters (@MaxineWaters) July 30, 2017Rep. Waters is likely right. There s no way establishment Republicans like Mike Pence actually like living with Donald Trump as president. He is, and always has been, nothing more than a vehicle to put them in power. And honestly, because of the chaos, Trump has exactly zero legislative achievements. Sure, Jeff Sessions is doing awful things from the DOJ, but those horrific policies can be promptly reversed once a new administration arrives. Trump is ignorant, incompetent, and crazy. Pence, however, is much more dangerous. I can t believe I m saying this, but I truly hope Rep. Waters  predictions never come to pass. America will be an Evangelical theocracy in no time under Pence.In short, either way, America, we re screwed.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"July 30, 2017"
6244, Donald Trump Makes Another Truly Pathetic Attempt At Making Hispanics Like Him (VIDEO),"Donald Trump just can t accept that he has completely demolished any and all chances of winning over the Hispanic vote.Refusing to be discouraged by the fact that he s offended the Hispanic community since day one of his disgraceful presidential campaign and continuously pummeled the minority group throughout the election cycle, the presumptive Republican nominee is trying to reach out to the very community that he said was made up of  rapists  and  drug dealers. Trump gave his  first direct message to Hispanic conservatives  over the phone, while sitting alone on a private plane. It s truly bizarre and uncomfortable to watch, but then again so is everything else The Donald does. During his 2-minute message, which was aired at the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference in California, Trump promised to do away with minority unemployment and stop illegal drug cartels. While Trump rattled off a few more talking points, the business mogul s main message to Hispanics could be summed up in these few sentences: National. Hispanic. Christian. Three great words. We re going to take care of you. We re going to work with you. You re going to be very happy. You re gonna like President Trump. You can watch Trump s awkward message below:The idea of Trump sincerely trying to portray himself as a great candidate for Hispanic voter is, quite frankly, hilarious. As much as Trump loves his polls, he must be absolutely oblivious or in severe denial   it s been widely reported that Trump is still struggling big time to get support from the Hispanic community, and that s probably not going to change anytime soon.Many Hispanic voters have pledged their support to Trump s rival, Democratic front runner Hillary Clinton, with only 23% of them stating that they would vote for Trump in November. In fact, many Hispanics registered for the first time this year for the sole purpose of voting AGAINST Trump. No matter how hard Trump tries to undo the damage he did in the beginning of his campaign, his attempts will likely fall short. The Hispanic community will not forget his offensive, hateful rhetoric, and neither should the rest of us.Featured image via Scott Olson / Getty Images",News,"May 21, 2016"
4530," Stolen Valor: GOP Senator Disgracefully Lies, Makes Up Military Service","Senator Mark Kirk (R-IL) has been caught red-handed lying about the details of his military service, and it isn t the first time he has done it. From The Huffington Post:CNN reported Wednesday that Kirk s campaign website erroneously stated that he is  a veteran of the Iraq War.  In reality, the senator stayed in the United States during the war as he served in the Navy Reserve.His campaign chalked it up to a staff error, saying that particular page on Kirk s website was not meant to be public and that staff members were making edits to it. Staff moved the page behind a password-protected firewall after CNN investigated.Kirk, who is up for re-election this year, has previously been caught in the middle of lies about his military career.He claimed in 2010 that he had been named  Intelligence Officer of the Year,  when the award was for work his entire unit had done. He also promoted a story alleging that his reconnaissance plane had come under fire, but there was no record of that. Kirk claimed that he had served in  combat  in Kosovo, but he didn t. He claimed he had been deployed to Afghanistan, but he had been sent there for training, not for combat service. He also previously falsely claimed to have been deployed to combat in Operation Desert Storm.Kirk s lies about his service would be a major issue at any time, but they are even more notable because he is facing a strong challenge from Rep. Tammy Duckworth (D-IL). Duckworth is an actual combat veteran who served in the Iraq War. In that conflict, Duckworth received a Purple Heart after her helicopter was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade. She is a double amputee after her severe injuries forced the removal of her right leg near the hip and her left leg below the knee.In polling averages, Duckworth is currently 7% ahead of Kirk.Featured image via Flickr",News,"September 21, 2016"
17186,SEATTLE MAYOR WANTS TO HELP MUSLIMS FOLLOW SHARIA LAW BY OFFERING PLAN TO HELP BUY HOMES,"No word yet about the Mayor developing a plan to help Christians who refuse to bake wedding cakes for gays based on their religious beliefs For some Muslims, it can be hard to buy a house, and Mayor Ed Murray plans to do something about it.On Monday, Murray s housing committee released its recommendations for ways the city can increase housing in the city. Most ideas were what you d expect, including increasing the city s housing levy and implementing new rules and regulations to foster development of market-rate and lower-income housing.One suggestion would help followers of Sharia law buy houses. That s virtually impossible now because Sharia law prohibits payment of interest on loans. The 28-member committee recommended the city convene lenders and community leaders to explore options for increasing access to Sharia-compliant loan products.Based on what he called  rough anecdotal evidence,  Bukhari estimated a couple hundred people aren t borrowing money for houses due to their religion. He said this includes even high-wage earners, such as the more than 1,000 Muslims who work for Microsoft (Nasdaq: MFST) and more than 500 Amazon.com (Nasdaq: AMZN) employees.They could easily qualify for home loans but opt not to apply  simply because they don t want to pay interest,  Bukhari said.Murray will send legislation based on the committee s ideas to the City Council for consideration. During a press conference, he said he wants to help Muslims. We will work to develop new tools for Muslims who are prevented from using conventional mortgage products due to their religious beliefs,  Murray said.More and more lenders are offering Sharia-compliant financing, according to a USA Today report. The sector has grown to more than $1.6 trillion in assets worldwide over the past three decades, and analysts see potential for continued growth as the number of Muslims in the United States and Europe grows.It s unclear how many Muslims in Seattle would benefit from Murray s plan. The Washington state chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) estimates more than 30,000 Muslims live in the greater Seattle area, and Chapter Executive Director Arsalan Bukhari on Tuesday said it s  fairly common  for some not to seek loans.

21173,"THE NEW SWEDEN: Rapes, Riots, Severed Heads, Freeloading Foreigners And Shocking Acquittals","The consequences of throwing out the welcome mat for people who have no intention of obeying your rules or living in a world with morals or values  Some 30 Muslim men thought that the woman was in violation of Islamic sharia law, by being in Sweden unaccompanied by a man. They thought that she should therefore be raped and her teenage son killed.  Two Swedish citizens were convicted by a Gothenburg Court of joining an Islamist terror group in Syria and murdering two captives. Video evidence showed one victim being beheaded.  Every night when I have gone to bed, I have seen a head hanging in the air.    Court Chairman Ralf G. Larsson.  Sometime during the night, the victim was awakened by the Iraqi as he raped her. The woman managed to break free and locate a train attendant. At first, the woman did not want to call the police.  She felt sorry for him [the rapist]   and was afraid he would be deported back to Iraq. One week after Sweden raised its terror alert level to the highest ever, the police raised another alarm   saying their weapons are simply not good enough to prevent a potential terror attack.November 4: The Swedish Immigration Service sent out a press release, saying that it had hired close to a thousand additional employees since June. The Immigration Service now has over 7,000 employees, including hourly workers and consultants   double the 3,350 employees who worked there in 2012. Most of the new recruits work with the legal processing of asylum applications, but the units dealing with receiving migrants and filing their initial applications have also expanded considerably. As if the record influx of migrants this autumn were not crushing enough, the Immigration Service also had trouble retaining its staff. Employees complain about being badly treated: they are always expected to be on call, and possibly even work Christmas Eve.November 4: Bobel Barqasho, a 31-year-old Syrian, was sentenced by Sweden s Supreme Court to 14 years in prison. Before his case reached the Supreme Court, Barqasho had been sentenced by a lower court to 9 years in prison, then acquitted by the Court of Appeals. In February 2013, Barqasho threw his wife off a sixth-floor balcony. Against all odds, the woman survived the 13-meter (about 43 feet) fall, but was badly injured. When she woke up after five weeks in a coma, her head was held together by a helmet, her face felt loose, and her teeth were gone. In the Court of Appeals, the defense managed to plant reasonable doubt about the man s guilt by claiming the woman was depressed and had jumped of her own free will] so the Court of Appeals set him free. By the time the Supreme Court pronounced its sentence of 14 years, Barqasho had disappeared. He is now being sought by Interpol.November 6: The Gr nkulla School in Alvesta closed after reports of a rape at the facility spread on social media. A Somali boy had apparently been sexually harassing a 12-year-old girl for some time. On October 17, he allegedly took his attentions a step farther, pulled the girl behind a bush and raped her. The girl s father had been unsuccessful in trying to get the school to address the problem earlier, but even after the reported rape, the school s management did not act. The boy was allowed to continue going to the school   just on a schedule different from the girl s. Her distraught parents told the news website Fria Tider:  We are being spat on because we are Swedish.  In protest against the school s management, many parents, viewing the school as having sided with the perpetrator, moved their children to other schools.November 9: Social commentator and whistleblower Merit Wager revealed on her blog that administrators at the Immigration Service had all been ordered to  accept the claim that an applicant is a child, if he does not look as if he is over 40.  A staggering 32,180  unaccompanied refugee children  had arrived during 2015 by December 1   since then another 1,130 have come   and the government finally decided to take action.If its proposition is approved by Parliament, everyone who looks adult-aged will be forced to go through a medical age-determination procedure. One of the reasons Sweden stopped doing these in the first place, was that pediatricians refused to take part in them. They said the procedures were  unreliable. November 10: A 28-year-old Iraqi man was prosecuted for raping a woman on a night train between Finland and Sweden. The man had originally planned to seek asylum in Finland, but had found the living conditions there too harsh. He had therefore taken a train back to Sweden. In a couchette (sleeping car where men and women are together), the rapist and two other asylum seekers met one of the many Swedish women whose hearts go out to  new arrivals.  The woman bought sandwiches for the men; they drank vodka. When two of the men started groping the woman, she told them to stop, yet chose to lie down and go to sleep. Sometime during the night, she was awakened by the Iraqi as he raped her. The woman managed to break free and locate a train attendant. To the attendant s surprise, the woman did not immediately want to press charges. The court documents state:  The train attendant asked if he should call the police. At first, the woman did not want him to do so, because she did not want to put N.N., an asylum seeker, in a tough spot. She felt sorry for him  and was afraid he would be deported back to Iraq. The man was given a sentence of one year in prison, payment of 85,000 kronor (about $10,000) in damages, and deportation   but will be allowed to come back to Sweden after five years.November 10: An Algerian and a Syrian asylum seeker were indicted for raping a Swedish woman in Str ngn s. The men, 39-year-old from Algeria and 31-year-old from Syria, met the woman in a bar one night in August. When the woman left, one of the men followed her, pulled her to the ground, and assaulted her. Afterwards, the woman kept walking, and ran into two other men   the Syrian and another unidentified man   and was raped again. The Syrian reportedly also spit her in face and said,  I m going to f k you, little Swedish girl.  The men, who lived at the same asylum house, denied knowing each other when questioned by the police.The verdict was announced on December 1. Rapist number one was sentenced to 2.5 years in prison, 117,000 kronor (about $14,000) in damages, and deportation to Algeria. Rapist number two was convicted of aggravated rape and sentenced to four years in prison. He cannot be deported, however, because  there are currently hindrances towards enforcing deportations to Syria.  He was also ordered to pay the woman 167,000 kronor (about $20,000) in damages.November 13: A trial began against eight Eritrean men, between the ages of 19 and 26, who according to the District Court,  crudely and ruthlessly  gang-raped a 45-year-old woman. She had been waiting in a stairwell for a friend when the men invited her into an apartment. Inside, she was thrown on the floor, held down, beaten and brutally raped. When questioned by the police, she said,  It felt as if there were hands and fingers everyplace. Fingers penetrated me, vaginally, anally. It hurt very much. I could feel the fingernails.  She said she could also hear the Eritreans laughing and speaking in their own language while they raped her.  They seemed to be enjoying themselves,  she said.When two of the men started fighting over who should rape her next, she tried to flee, but one of the men hit her over the head; she fell unconscious. After coming to, she escaped out a window and was able to reach a neighbor.The District Court of Falun established that several men had taken part in the attack, but the District Attorney was unable to prove who had done what. Therefore, only one man was convicted of aggravated rape, and sentenced to five years in prison. The others were sentenced to only 10 months in prison for helping to conceal a serious criminal offense. After serving their time, the men will be allowed to stay in Sweden.November 14: The Swedish Security Service, S po, warned again of Muslim terrorists hiding among migrants. The number of individuals listed as potential security threats has tripled this year, and includes several hundred who may be ready to carry out  Paris-style  attacks.As the Immigration Service has a huge backlog in trying to register all 150,000 asylum seekers who have come to Sweden so far in 2015, there are probably also many migrants that would be considered potential security threats.November 14: Sweden s Foreign Minister, Margot Wallstr m, made yet another strange statement with diplomatic consequences. The day after the Paris attacks, in an interview with Swedish Public Television, Wallstr m was asked,  How worried are you about the radicalization of young people in Sweden who choose to fight for ISIS?  Wallstr m replied: Yes, of course we have a reason to be worried not only here in Sweden but around the world, because there are so many who are being radicalized. Here again, you come back to situations like that in the Middle East, where not least the Palestinians see that there isn t any future for us [the Palestinians], we either have to accept a desperate situation or resort to violence. Two days later, the Swedish ambassador to Israel, Carl Magnus Nesser, was called to a meeting at the Israeli Foreign Ministry. Its spokesman, Emmanuel Nahshon, later told Reuters,  The Swedish Foreign Minister s statements are appallingly impudent  [She] demonstrates genuine hostility when she points to a connection of any kind between the terror attacks in Paris and the complex situation between Israel and the Palestinians. In a formal statement, the Swedish Foreign Ministry denied that Margot Wallstr m s remark had connected the Paris attacks with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. A Swedish Conservative (Moderaterna) Member of Parliament, Hanif Bali, sarcastically tweeted that it seemed the Foreign Minister is suffering from an  obvious case of Israel-Tourette s. November 18: The Authority for Civil Protection and Contingency Planning (MSB) warned that the asylum situation was not only  very strained,  but that things keep getting worse   and that in some parts of Sweden, the authorities can only function until the end of December. Meanwhile, the Immigration Service calculated that another 13,000 beds are needed in so-called evacuation accommodations.  The problem cannot be fully solved even if the Armed Forces help provide more housing or if the MSB could arrange more tent accommodations,  the authority wrote.The massive influx of asylum seekers has also led to native Swedes  being crowded out of the health care and social services systems,  according to the MSB.  It [the MSB] is so busy handling unaccompanied children and asylum seekers, that there simply is not enough time to tend to the everyday functions, such as healthcare and social services,  said Alexandra Nordlander, Chief of Operative Analysis at the MSB, to the daily tabloid, Aftonbladet.November 19: A fire broke out at Lundsbrunn Spa, a few weeks after plans were announced to convert the historic building into the biggest asylum-seekers  home in Sweden. According to the police, the fire was not an arson, but started in a wood-pellet stove.Many hotels and spas have transforming themselves into asylum-seekers  housing, in order to profit from lucrative deals offered by the Immigration Service. Lundsbrunn Spa, near a mineral spring, dates back to 1890; in 1817, a hospital was established on the grounds. The nearby village is home to fewer than 1,000 people, so when Lundsbrunn Spa decided to accept an offer from the Immigration Service, the village faced a doubling of its population. The owners of Lundsbrunn wrote on the Spa s website that they see the transformation from spa to asylum-seekers  home as a temporary measure.November 20: Norwegian businessman Petter Stordalen, the billionaire owner of Nordic Choice Hotels, announced that the chain s many properties in Scandinavia and the Baltic states would no longer serve their guests sausage and bacon for breakfast. The breakfast buffet of the Nordic Choice s Clarion Hotel Post in Gothenburg was named earlier this year the best hotel breakfast in the world by the British newspaper, The Mirror. But apparently, this award did not matter.The cause for the hotel s decision was cited as  health reasons.  The internet, however, was soon abuzz with speculation that the real reason was adaptation to Islamic dietary laws (halal). One week later, Stordalen backtracked. The reaction from hotel guests had been too strong. Many people vented their anger over the withheld bacon on Stordalen s Facebook page. Stordalen commented:  The guests have spoken. Comfort Hotels are bringing back bacon. November 23: Hassan Mostafa Al-Mandlawi, 32, and Al Amin Sultan, 30, were indicted in the Gothenburg Municipal Court, suspected of having traveled to Syria in 2013 and murdering at least two people there. The charge was terrorist crimes, (alternatively crimes against international law) and murder. Chief Prosecutor Agnetha Hilding Qvarnstr m, of the National Unit for Security Cases, said:  The act [was] committed with the intent to harm the state of Syria and intimidate the people, thus the classification: terrorist crimes. The hard part is to clarify fully whether these men have been part of an armed group, and acted within the frames of the armed conflict, or not. The accused men came to Sweden, one from Iraq and one from Syria, as children, but grew up in Sweden and are Swedish citizens. They traveled to Syria in 2013, and joined one of the many Islamist terror groups there. According to the prosecution, they murdered two captured workers in an industrial area of Aleppo by slitting their throats. The prosecutor wrote that,  Al-Mandlawi and Sultan have both expressed delight at the deeds. During the trial, films of the executions were shown, but both men still denied having committed the crimes. Those present in court agreed that the films were among the most disturbing ever displayed in a Swedish court. First, they show a man having his throat slit, the blood gushing before he dies. Then, the other victim s head is severed from his body, and the killer holds up the severed head to loud cheers from the others. The court s chairman, Ralf G. Larsson, told the news agency, TT:  Every night when I have gone to bed, I have seen a head hanging in the air. The verdict was announced December 14: Both men were convicted of terrorist crimes and sentenced to life in prison. The verdict will be appealed, the defense lawyers said.Via: Gatestone Institute",left-news,"Jan 2, 2016"
21766,LYING WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: “OBAMA HAS SCRATCHED AND CLAWED FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS”,"It s interesting that Josh Earnest still carries around the line of bs that all middle class Americans know is a lie. He is, after all,  the chief propagandist for Obama so lying is what he does professionally. The truth is, Obama s presidency has been horrific for the middle class but great for the uber wealthy. Once again, they re counting on the American people to buy the line of bs and propaganda instead of looking at facts One moment of unintended   and unnoticed   levity occurred near the end of the White House briefing Tuesday, when White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest claimed that President Obama has been  a president of the United States that for the last six and a half years has scratched and clawed to protect the interests of middle-class families all across the country. Not sure about who or what he has scratched and clawed. Because the markings are difficult to discern.The White House is careful to dress up its policies as  middle class economics.  Because the middle class is where the votes are. But the Obama presidency is not about the middle class.You can agree or disagree with Obama s methods and policies. But his chief enthusiasm has been helping the lower classes by expanding the welfare state and regulating businesses. The middle class stuff is camouflage for the real agenda.The proof is in the pudding. Here s the pudding.According to Reuters:Barack Obama enters the final two years of his presidency with a blemish on his legacy that looks impossible to erase: the decline of the middle class he has promised to rescue.Federal Reserve survey data show families in the middle fifth of the income scale now earn less and their net worth is lower than when Obama took office. In the six years through 2013, over the recession and recovery that have spanned Obama s tenure, jobs have been added at the top and bottom of the wage scale, a Reuters analysis of labor statistics shows. In the middle, the economy has shed positions   whether in traditional trades like machining or electrical work, white-collar jobs in human resources, or technical ones like computer operators.Between 2010 and 2013, as recovery took hold and stock markets soared, the average net worth of families in the top 40 percent of income earners grew. For all others average net worth shrank, declining 19 percent for the middle fifth.These results stem from specific policies. Obama s chief domestic initiative, Obamacare, is not a middle class program. It s an effort to get health insurance to the lower class, including a massive expansion of Medicaid. Expanding health insurance is a good goal, but the way he has done it involves turning insurers effectively into wards of the state and raising the price and lowering the quality of healthcare for everyone else.Among his other battle cries are raising the minimum wage and legalizing illegal immigrants. He pushed and signed legislation containing massive new regulations on the banks, wants to regulate carbon emissions by fiat, and has enlarged the government s share of the economy while running up trillions in debt.Meantime the WEALTHY have benefited during Obama s tenure for the zero-interest rate Fed policies needed to keep the economy afloat in the absence of any serious presidential leadership on expanding the economy. The low rates have grandly goosed everyone s stock portfolios and made the rich richer.These things he scratches and claws for. Not private sector expansion and business-friendly policies that would promote middle class expansion.And the results speak for themselves.Via: White House Dossier",left-news,"May 7, 2015"
19859,IRANIAN SCIENTIST HANGED For “Revealing [Nuclear Weapons] Secrets To The Enemy” After Hillary Revealed Top Secret Intel About Him Through Unsecured Email,"Reckless Hillary couldn t have cared less about the seriousness of exposing America s top-secret intel to the world by using an unsecured email server. Why would any American want to put her in charge of our troops? Why would any voter trust her with our national security. The job of Commander In Chief is too important to leave to a self-serving grifter simply because she is equipped with female genitalia. Just ask the family of Shahram Amiri a friend of the US who paid the ultimate price for providing America with Iran s nuclear weapons secrets while Hillary was our crooked Secretary of State Hillary Clinton used her private email server to discuss details of the Iranian nuclear scientist who was executed for giving information to the CIA.Shahram Amiri, who was hanged for  revealing secrets to the enemy , was in the US and allegedly informing on Tehran s extensive nuclear program during the Democrat s controversial reign as Secretary of State.At the time she stressed researcher had been there of his  own free will  and was described as  our friend  in correspondences. But he maintained he had been kidnapped by intelligence agents. Emails sent by Clinton s advisers point to the scandal involving Amiri   suggesting it was a  diplomatic, psychological issue , but not a  legal one .One aide also warned he would lead to  problematic news stories Richard Morningstar, a former State Department special envoy for Eurasian energy wrote to Clinton:  We should recognize his concerns and frame it in terms of a misunderstanding with no malevolent intent and that we will make sure there is no recurrence. Our friend has to be given a way out. Our person won t be able to do anything anyway. If he has to leave so be it.  Senior adviser Jake Sullivan sent another email about Amiri on July 12, 2010.It appears he is referring to the scientist just hours before he showed up at the Iranian interests section of the Pakistani Embassy in Washington D.C., demanding he be sent home.He said:  The gentleman  has apparently gone to his country s interests section because he is unhappy with how much time it has taken to facilitate his departure. This could lead to problematic news stories in the next 24 hours. Amiri went missing in 2009 after leaving for a pilgrimage to Mecca, but appeared in a video   apparently recorded in the U.S.   in which he claimed to have been put under pressure to  reveal sensitive information  to the intelligence agency.In interviews he has claimed he was drugged, put on a plane, and then kept under  psychological pressure  at an undisclosed location in the U.S.There he was asked to hand over classified documents, but he claims he never did as he didn t want to betray his country.He then walked into the Iranian interests section at the Pakistani Embassy in Washington and demanded to be sent home.He came back to a hero s welcome and insisted he was a  simple researcher .Amiri worked for a university affiliated with Tehran s extensive nuclear program.He is said to have had an in-depth knowledge of Iran s nuclear program and was kept at a secret location after returning to the country.According to CBS, he told officials in interviews he was being held against his will by Saudi and U.S. spies.But American officials said he was set to receive millions for informing.Amiri s mother told the BBC that his body had been sent to her with rope marks around his neck.On Sunday, an Iranian judicial spokesman confirmed the execution had taken place.Iran confirms execution of Iranian nuclear scientistHe told the Mizan Online news site:  Shahram Amiri was hanged for revealing the country s top secrets to the enemy (US).  In another recording filmed when he was missing, the scientist suggested he had fled from the USA, where he had been held against his will.But US officials said they paid Amiri some $5 million to defect and provide  significant  information about Iran s atomic program. Amiri later fled the U.S. without the money.Iranian officials previously touted Amiri s claim he had been abducted by U.S. agents while on a pilgrimage to holy sites in Saudi Arabia.They welcomed him home in 2010 as a hero.But his family confirmed to the BBC he had been given a lengthy jail sentence after returning to the Middle East.The State Department declined to comment on Amiri s execution.Via: Daily Mail",left-news,"Oct 6, 2016"

18696,NEW BIOGRAPHY Exposes Barack Obama’s Dream Of Becoming Donald Trump,"Barack Obama s white college girlfriend Sheila Miyoshi Jager, who is now a professor at Oberlin College, tells a story of a very calculating man who was not about to let her race get in the way of his political ambitions: In the winter of  86, when we visited my parents, he asked me to marry him,  she told Garrow. Her parents were opposed, less for any racial reasons (Barack came across to them like  a white, middle-class kid,  a close family friend said) than for concern about Obama s professional prospects, and because her mother thought Sheila, two years Obama s junior, was too young.  Not yet,  Sheila told Barack. But they stayed together.In early 1987, when Obama was 25, she sensed a change.  He became. . . so very ambitious  very suddenly,  she told Garrow.  I remember very clearly when this transformation happened, and I remember very specifically that by 1987, about a year into our relationship, he already had his sights on becoming president. Discussions of race and politics suddenly overwhelmed Sheila and Barack s relationship.  The marriage discussions dragged on and on,  but now they were clouded by Obama s  torment over this central issue of his life . . . race and identity,  Sheila recalls. The  resolution of his black identity was directly linked to his decision to pursue a political career,  she said.At Harvard, the Obama the world has come to know took clearer form. In his late 20s now and slightly older than most classmates, he had a compulsion to orate in class and summarize other people s arguments for them.  In law school the only thing I would have voted for Obama to do would have been to shut up,  one student told Garrow. Classmates created a Obamanometer, ranking  how pretentious someone s remarks are in class. If Garrow is indeed correct in concluding that Obama s romantic choices were influenced by his political ambitions, it is no small irony that Michelle Obama became one of those most skeptical about Obama s political prospects, and most dubious about his will to rise. She constantly discourages his efforts toward elective office and resents the time he spends away from her and their two young daughters. Obama vented to a friend how often Michelle would talk about money.  Why don t you go out and get a good job? You re a lawyer   you can make all the money we need,  she would tell him, as the couple struggled with student loans and the demands of family and political life. (Garrow sides with Michelle, highlighting how, on the day after Sasha was born, Barack went downtown for a meeting.)As he considered a U.S. Senate bid, Obama s team commissioned a poll that covered, among other questions, his name.  Barry,  as he was known from childhood into his early college years, polled better than  Barack,  but Obama never considered resurrecting the old name. He had made his choice, of identity and image, long ago. Sheila recalls that one of the few times Obama became genuinely angry with her was in Hawaii, when she heard relatives calling him Barry, and she did so as well, just for fun. He became  irrationally furious,  she said.  He told me that under no circumstances was I ever to use that name with him. There was no going back.The sense of destiny is not unusual among those who become president. (See Clinton, Bill.) But it created complications. Obama believed that he had a  calling,  Garrow writes, and in his case it was  coupled with a heightened awareness that to pursue it he had to fully identify as African American. Obama had considered Donald Trump long before either man won the presidency, and brushed off his existence as a misguided national fantasy. Americans have a  continuing normative commitment to the ideals of individual freedom and mobility,  Obama wrote in the old Harvard book manuscript, now more than 25 years old.  The depth of this commitment may be summarily dismissed as the unfounded optimism of the average American   I may not be Donald Trump now, but just you wait; if I don t make it, my children will.

3583, WATCH: Racist Republican Gets Her A** Handed To Her For Claiming Trump Campaign Wasn’t Racist,"Conservatives are damned liars and they need to be called out every time they claim Donald Trump s campaign wasn t racist.Throughout the 2016 presidential campaign, Donald Trump constantly winked and nodded at white supremacists and white nationalists to the point where they threw their support to his campaign and starting showing up at his rallies.In fact, the only group of voters that Donald Trump did not insult or denounce were white racists while he consistently spewed hateful and discriminatory rhetoric at Latinos, black people, and Muslims.It is common knowledge that racism was a key part of Trump s vicious campaign. But Trump supporter Betsy McCaughey repeatedly claimed otherwise and actually had the gall to accuse Democrats of being the real racists during a Saturday appearance on CNN with Democratic counterpart Symone Sanders, who is black. I think the campaign has been very gracious in victory,  McCaughey claimed.  But what disturbs me the most is to see the Democratic Party leaders and spokespeople like Symone are still making false accusations of racism   in fact, behaving like racists themselves. One reason Donald Trump won is Americans are sick and tired of reverse racism and that s what they heard from Hillary Clinton at the beginning. Except that Hillary Clinton s message was about coming together and building a stronger America for everyone. Trump, meanwhile, questioned President Obama s place of birth for years, accused a judge of being biased because  he s a Mexican,  repeatedly condoned beatings of black protesters at his rallies, and refused to denounce white supremacists among many other examples.McCaughey ranted on about how Democrats are to blame for racism in this country, only to be absolutely BURIED by Sanders. We ve got to cut this out,  Sanders said.  Betsy, people of color in America are victims of systemic racism and I think it s really important to note that while the Trump campaign, yes, they won. Donald Trump is going to be the next president, there are still some real underlying issues. The rhetoric that the campaign elevated, these fringe elements that they brought into the mainstream. These are the things that people in America are still dealing with. The Trump campaign has to at least own that so we can move forward. And the truth-bomb that Sanders dropped made McCaughey lose her shit to the point that she actually directed a racist term at Sanders and instantly proved Sanders  point. I don t appreciate these accusations of racism because they are untrue and the only reason that people like Symone constantly label their opponents as racist is because they don t have an argument they can win on the merits. Again, Symone Sanders is a black woman, so when McCaughey said  people like Symone,  it was instantly recognized as racist. Racists often use the term  you people  as a racial slur in order to dehumanize their opponent and blame an entire class or race of people for something.Even Sanders pointed it out.  Betsy just  You people-d  me. Thank you. Thus, Sanders won the argument and made McCaughey reveal herself as a racist on national television.Here s the video via YouTube.McCaughey is also dead wrong about Trump being gracious in victory. He has been anything but gracious. In fact, he s rubbing it in by going on an unprecedented victory tour. If President Obama had done that in 2012, conservatives would have thrown temper tantrums across the country and hurled the N-word at will.The bottom line is that Donald Trump did NOT win this election by having better policies. He won because he energized the racists in this country to vote for him. And the fact that he picked people like Jeff Sessions and Steve Bannon for key positions in his administration speaks volumes about how racist he is, especially since the KKK and white nationalists overwhelmingly approve of those two choices.Featured image via screenshot",News,"December 3, 2016"

The parents should be getting regular visits by social services and the fired school manager and teacher should be reinstated and given an award for the courage to do the right thing Two school staff members say they were fired for refusing to call a six-year-old girl a boy and addressing her by a new masculine name.According to Madeline Kirksey, a manager at the Children s Lighthouse Learning Center in Katy, Texas, her staff was told a six-year-old student is transgender after the child s parents cut her hair short, Fox26 reported. They were instructed to begin referring to the student as a boy and call her by a boy s name.School administrators reportedly gave staff a handout to refer to when addressing questions from other students. It caused confusion,  Kirksey told Fox26.  I don t think we should be talking to other people s children who are under the age of 18 about being transgender. She said the school fired her after she insisted the parents of other students be notified and allowed to address the issue with their children.Not only where the other students disoriented by the sudden change, but the transgender student seemed to be confused as well. One day, she wanted to be a girl, the next day she wanted to be a boy,  Kirksey said.  The other kids are confused as well, calling her a boy and she would start screaming,  I m not a boy!

It s the civility many of us have come to expect from Trump supporters who ve been unjustly attacked by uncivil and in many cases, unlawful Bernie Sanders supporters. A politically-motivated vandal in Washington State admittedly vandalized a Trump supporter s car, slashing its tires and dumping rotten yogurt through its sun roof, according to a police report filed last Monday.The suspect, named in the report as one Riley M. Silva of Gig Harbour, Washington, confessed his crime to the police. Showing no sign of remorse, he claimed his victim was an  ignorant bigot  and that he  improved the community  by vandalizing the car. According to the report, the culprit became angry after noticing that the car sported a Donald Trump sticker.His full confession to the police, which was originally posted on the blog of lawyer and author Mike Cernovich, reads as follows:I on the 11th day of the 4th month of 2016 did maliciously attack a hate symbol protected by the first amendment. After disabling the vehicle and dumping rotten food into the interior I feel I have improved the community and supported our nation s values by stopping a promoter of hate speech. I do not wish to have ignorant bigots in my town and in a just world the person deserved what was received and the situation is made whole.As America is far from just, I expect the bigot will want to be made whole. With this I declare he is owed nothng. But as the situation is what it is, I intend to make the individual whole provided he cease to promote ignorance and hate. I do not expect the law to recognize damage to tools of hate or fascism. Such things need to be destroyed so good people may remain and become free.The victim, Nathan Elliot, later posted pictures of the damage to his vehicle. In his statement to the police, he said that the damage to the tire alone would cost $500 to repair.Bernie Sanders supporter didn't like my Trump bumper sticker, so he vandalized my personal property.

7541, Watch Megyn Kelly Prove She Has No Idea How The First Amendment Works (VIDEO),"On Friday night, Megyn Kelly decided to weigh in on the protest in Chicago that sent Donald Trump packing. She, like must conservatives, accused the protestors of denying Trump and his supporters their first amendment rights. His First Amendment free speech rights have been shut down,  Kelly said.  The right of those to listen to him, and as that one gentleman put it so well:  I just want to hear him for myself, wanna hear him for myself.  That was shut down by folks who have an agenda and that s fine. You can oppose Donald Trump. Go for it. But, is this the way?  Kelly continues.  Is this the way to shut down the ability of Chicagoans and those, in some cases, who have traveled for miles and miles and waited for hours and hours to get in, to have their say and hear him for themselves. For all these people know, they weren t Trump supporters. Maybe they would have walked away saying,  You know what? He s not for me.  We ll never know now. Well, seems that Kelly has forgotten a very key component to the First Amendment. Freedom of assembly is a right granted to everyone. That means that the protestors had just as much of a right to go protest Trump, as Trump has a right to go spew whatever hateful rhetoric he wants.No one forced Trump to run away. The Chicago police did not advise Trump s campaign to cancel the rally. This wasn t a  safe space  for Trump and his supporters to preach hate against minorities and make jokes about how big their d*cks are, it was an event open to the public.

1571, MSNBC BRILLIANTLY Smacks Offended Trumpkins Who Want Colbert Fired For A Joke (VIDEO),"By now, everyone knows that Stephen Colbert laid into Donald Trump in spectacular fashion on Monday night with a tirade that culminated with the Late Show host declaring that the wannabe president s mouth isn t good for anything but serving as Russian President Vladimir Putin s  cock holster.  Now, considering all the vulgar language Trump has used and continues to use, and his cavalier attitude toward said language   and, in some cases, even actions   one would think this sort of thing would be accepted as par for the course in this administration. But, alas, common sense is scarce here, so of course Trump and his supporters are offended. Hell, even the Federal Communications Commission is trying to go after Colbert for the joke. Well, an MSNBC panel has just about had enough of the double standards and hypocrisy on this one, and they let Trump and his cronies know it on Saturday.Dean Obeidallah, Scott Blakeman and Judy Gold appeared on Saturday s edition of Joy Reid s weekend show, AM Joy, and lit into the people going after Colbert for making fun of Trump in a crude way. First, Obeidallah railed against the idea that GOP types could ever think   much less care   that joke was homophobic. He also alluded to how it is Trump who took our politics into the gutter, and therefore he is not immune to being the subject of such crude jokes: Nothing is off limits with this guy. I think comedians are playing a role in preventing him from being normalized. Too bad little snowflakes. We re going to make as many jokes as we want. You need a safe space, go hide. Put on your big boy pants because it s just beginning. Judy Gold then chimed in, reminding everyone that right-wingers bitched about Ann Coulter being too nasty to speak at Berkeley, and how right-wingers reacted to that. Either they like free speech or they don t. Gold said: The outrage that we had to listen to about Ann Coulter and her hate speech at Berkeley that the conservatives were,  Oh, you know, there s too much political correctness, too much of this and too much of that.  Colbert is a comedian. He is telling a joke. Funny is funny. This panel is correct. The Right wants to cry foul if someone shuts down one of their speakers, but they want a late night comedian fined if he says something that is a little too off color for their tastes about their great orange leader. Get used to it, conservatives. Elect a clown, expect a circus. And expect the people who realize what a clown he is to make fun of said clown and its circus.Watch the video below:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"May 7, 2017"
3978, DAMNING New Poll Shows A BIG Chunk Of Federal Employees Could Quit Their Jobs If Trump Wins,"It seems that Donald Trump is rather unpopular with the workforce that will have to answer to him if he s elected. Despite the union representing ICE endorsing him, other federal workers in various ederal agencies view Hillary far more favorably than Trump. That s not too terribly surprising. What is surprising, though, is that a number of them may just up and quit their jobs if they find their agencies answering to a President Trump.A large number of them. A recent poll, from a federal publication called Government Executive, surveyed a random sample of 1,085 federal employees across 35 agencies and found that Hillary has a commanding lead over Trump, with 53 percent saying they d vote for her vs. 35 percent saying they d vote for Trump if the election were today.Image via Government ExecutiveBut the more damning statistic was that 27 percent said they would, would consider, or might leave the federal service if Trump was elected. That s compared to 16 percent for Hillary. Nine percent said they didn t know what they d do if Trump was elected, compared to just five percent who said that about Hillary.Image via Government ExecutiveImage via Government ExecutiveFederal employees do tend to lean Democratic in part because their jobs are more secure, and they do better economically, under Democratic presidents rather than Republicans. Donald Trump just adds to the GOP s woes in this area because he s a completely incompetent fool that they allowed to become their nominee.In fact, that s evidenced in another damning part of the poll. Thirty-one percent of respondents feel that Hillary would be very effective at managing federal agencies, whereas only 18 percent feel Trump could do that job very well. Just 27 percent said that Hillary would be  not at all effective  in that arena, compared to a whopping 51 percent who believe that about Trump.Image via Government ExecutiveImage via Government ExecutiveThe federal workforce is made up of more than four million people, including our 1.5 million members of the military. Assuming everyone who resigned was in the civilian workforce, that s well over 700,000 employees who would leave under Trump. Add the military members who could consider early retirement into that, and Trump s in a lot of trouble. At the bare minimum, Trump would have to face a workforce that, by and large, doesn t like him, along with a quick loss of hundreds of thousands employees.As for the rest of the country, the federal workforce would then fill up with Trumpkins, which could make life worse for us even faster. We sooo do not need a federal workforce full of deplorables. That would be deplorable.Sure, Republicans would probably paint that as a good thing because they say we need to shrink the size of the government anyway, but the whole thing could backfire spectacularly depending on which agencies suffered the heaviest losses.But really, we can t blame them for feeling this way. Trump would be the worst president to happen to this country.Featured image by Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images",News,"November 1, 2016"

1609, Andrew Jackson Biographer: Trump Actually Said He Could Have Prevented The Civil War (VIDEO),"Donald Trump s Andrew Jackson-Civil War debacle just continues to get worse and worse.Yesterday, Trump had a massive history fail during a radio interview, where the moronic POTUS stated that Andrew Jackson   who had died 16 years before the Civil War even started   was angry that the war had not been avoided. Trump also said that Jackson could have stopped the Civil War from happening, lavishing praise upon the slave-owning seventh president. And apparently, Trump also thinks that HE could have stopped the Civil War.Trump s disgusting Civil War comments have prompted Andrew Jackson biographer and historian Jon Meacham, the author of  American Lion: Andrew Jackson in the White House, to speak out and address Trump s comments. According to Meacham, it was White House chief strategist Steve Bannon that made Trump fall in love with Jackson. The historian explained on MSNBC today: I spent an hour, hour and a half with him in May of  16 talking with him about presidents he admired and Jackson never came up. Steve Bannon put this in the conversation after the victory saying this was a Jacksonian moment. It was then that Trump connected himself to Jackson in his usual superficial way. Meacham said: It s a projection of the president s fundamental and enveloping narcissism. And then Meacham dropped this bombshell: He told me a year and a half ago or so, a year ago, that, you know, he thought he could have done a deal to have averted the war. Yes, Trump actually said he could have prevented the war with one of his deals. If it s anything like the  deals  and failed legislation we ve seen so far during his presidency, it s safe to say that Trump would have f*cked that up, too.Meacham also said that being in the White House tends to enhance the  fundamental characteristics  of the serving presidents   which is awful news for America right now. Meacham said: It s very hard, once you re there, to change. Some people do, and that s why we talk about them as great presidents. But most people, once they re in the Oval Office, actually just become more like themselves   and I think in this case that s on a particularly tragic trajectory. We couldn t agree more.

4802, Trump Surrogate Warns Of ‘Taco Trucks On Every Corner’ If Hillary Wins (VIDEO),"MSNBC s Joy Reid filled on All In With Chris Hayes Thursday night, and she had a most interesting guest on. Reid was joined by Marco Gutierrez, founder of Latinos for Trump. The subject was Trump s immigration plan, but it quickly devolved into a situation of the man being racist against his own people.While trying to pimp and sell Trump s very hardline immigration stance, Gutierrez warned of his  dominant  and  imposing  culture, and how it will take over the United States if we don t do things Trump s way. He said: We need to understand this is a different time and we re having problems here. Reid, being the tough interviewer that she is, cut him off and asked,  What problems are you talking about? That s when Gutierrez responded with a shockingly racist stereotype: My culture is a very dominant culture. And it s imposing, and it s causing problems. If you don t do something about it, you gonna have taco trucks on every corner. This takes self-loathing to a whole new level. This poor guy has bought the anti-immigrant line about the brown people taking over America hook, line, and sinker. Sad, but true.As for the Trump campaign   they really need to start screening their surrogates before letting them loose on the airwaves.

2631, Yemen Just Told Trump to Stay The F*ck Out Of Their Country After Disastrous FAILURE Of A Raid,"Donald Trump may call his disaster of a raid in Yemen last week a  success,  but the rest of the world views it as just one of the more deadly ways in which he has demonstrated his ineptitude   and now we are paying the price.Not only did Trump completely miss his main target, Qassim al-Rimi,  who is currently mocking him, but the poorly-planned raid slaughtered 30 civilians including 10 women and children (one of them a U.S. citizen). Three U.S. service members were injured and a Navy SEAL was killed.So what went wrong? Everything.Trump reportedly decided to go ahead with the raid over dinner after his cabinet convinced him it was the right thing to do by telling him that Obama would not have the balls to go through with him (seriously, that s all it took). According to a senior U.S. intelligence official,  almost everything went wrong  once the team arrived. Officials say Trump approved the attack without sufficient intelligence, ground support or adequate backup preparations.  On top of failing to kill his target, slaughtering civilians wholesale, murdering a U.S. citizen, and getting a SEAL killed with his bumbling mess of an operation, the intel that was gathered is garbage. The military is touting three videos they recovered from the raid as evidence of success   but the videos are a decade old and available on YouTube.Because of all this, Yemen has decided that they don t want Trump coming in and wrecking their living room again. The New York Times reports:Angry at the civilian casualties incurred last month in the first commando raid authorized by President Trump, Yemen has withdrawn permission for the United States to run Special Operations ground missions against suspected terrorist groups in the country, according to American officials.Grisly photographs of children apparently killed in the crossfire of a 50-minute firefight during the raid caused outrage in Yemen. A member of the Navy s SEAL Team 6, Chief Petty Officer William Owens, was also killed in the operation.While the White House continues to insist that the attack was a  success    a characterization it repeated on Tuesday   the suspension of commando operations is a setback for Mr. Trump, who has made it clear he plans to take a far more aggressive approach against Islamic militants. The fool of the White House got slapped at the beginning of his road in your lands, al-Rimi said in a video following Trump s failed raid. Yemen s decision not to let Trump play with his toys in their house is a bit uncomfortable for The Donald, who promised to step up our approach to fighting terrorism. Now that he is President, he has done nothing but hurt that effort.Watch a report on the raid below:Featured image via Getty Images/Pool",News,"February 8, 2017"
8158, Republicans Furious That Even Fox News Is Reporting How Low The Deficit Is Under Obama (VIDEO),"Something extraordinary happened that is certain to have Republicans and Republican voters everywhere furious   Fox News just admitted that the United States deficit is at its lowest level since 2008. That s right, since the last Republican was in office. You have to admit, this must have taken a lot of courage on the behalf of Fox News to admit something like this. It goes directly against their  bash President Obama for everything  policy.However, there it is, in bold print on FoxBusiness.com:They even published this, which will make every Republican that follows Fox News as a religion and believe without question, do a double take: The U.S. ran a budget surplus in January, dropping the annual deficit to its lowest level since August 2008, the Treasury Department said Wednesday.The U.S. deficit fell to $405 billion over the 12-month period ended January, or around 2.2% of gross domestic product, boosted by a $55 billion surplus in January. The deficit figure was down from the year-earlier $495 billion, or 2.8% of GDP.  Quite a change of heart when Fox News actually sees the results of Obama s actions. Unlike how they behaved years ago after the president first took office, which you can view here, when they completely ignored deficit reduction:Fox Business even explained how the reduction in deficit was achieved: Revenues stood around 6% above their year-earlier levels, while outlays were around 3% higher. Receipts of $314 billion collected by the Treasury was a record for the month of January.The latest report showed annual revenues posted their slowest rate of growth since August 2012. Corporate tax receipts for the fiscal year, which began Oct. 1., ran around 10% below their year-earlier level. Individual taxes withheld by employers and payroll tax revenues were up 3%, while other individual taxes, such as capital gains, were 8% higher. Funny how when you have a president that truly believes in math, they can actually achieve success in regards to deficit reduction, and understands that in order to pay for things, we need revenue coming in. Republicans have yet to figure that out.Now, if only we could get Republicans to actually look at the presidents latest budget, which as of now, they have simply refused to even entertain.The GOP is literally a vomit stain on the rug of America that we can t seem to remove.Featured image from Flickr",News,"February 12, 2016"
9187,JUST IN: Mystery Surrounds Obama Appointee Judge Who Recused Herself From Fusion GPS Case Also Handling DNC Corruption in Awan Brothers Case,"A federal judge in Washington, D.C. has recused herself from a second case involving Trump dossier firm Fusion GPS.Tanya S. Chutkan, an Obama appointee, recused herself on Monday from a case involving a dispute over subpoenas issued for Fusion GPS, the firm that commissioned the dossier.This Obama appointee is like so many others controversial. Change.org has a petition calling for her impeachmentA SUPPORTER COMMENT OF THE PETITION:  There is Clear and Present Danger, in our Government and to our Country. Judge Chutkin needs to do her duty, as Sworn by Oath, to let in ALL of the evidence pertaining to Imran Awan and Hina Alvi. As it stands today, 9/12/2017, Judge Chutkin is not doing her duty to protect the interests and lives of the Citizens of The United States. For this reason, I am standing with others, shoulder to shoulder, and calling for the Removal and Impeachment of Federal District Judge Tanya S. Chutkin. Aleksej Gubarev, a Russian tech executive accused in the dossier of hacking Democrats  computer systems, has sought to subpoena Fusion GPS records and to depose its employees to find out more about the research firm s work on the dossier.Gubarev is suing BuzzFeed for defamation for publishing the dossier earlier this year. He denies the allegations laid out in the document, which was written by former British spy Christopher Steele.Chutkan recused herself last month from another case involving Fusion GPS. The firm had filed suit against its bank, TD Bank, to keep it from complying with a subpoena issued by the House Intelligence Committee, which sought Fusion s bank records.Chutkan presided over that case from Oct. 20 to Nov. 9. It was reassigned to Judge Richard Leon, a George W. Bush appointee. Since taking over the case, Leon has indicated that he plans to allow more transparency into the court proceedings involving the battle over Fusion s bank records. He has ordered several documents be unsealed and made public.Chutkan has presided over the case involving the lawsuit against BuzzFeed since Aug. 31. Her replacement is Trevor McFadden, a Trump appointee who assumed office in October.The reasons for Chutkan s recusals remain a mystery Chutkan refused to comment on the recusal but her work with a medical technology firm also represented by Fusion GPS could be the reason.In any case, this is yet another case of the Obama hand in just about everything that has to do with corruption and intel agencies.Read more: Daily Caller",politics,"Dec 16, 2017"
22771,Fake News: The Collapse of the MSM’s ‘Facebook Russian Bot’ Story,"As 21WIRE said last year, the Russian hacking, or Russiagate story was a political hoax from the start. What this story can now demonstrate, is that for the last 18 months, the entire mainstream media has been promulgating a highly politicised, and relentless campaign of fake news designed to implicate Russia in an imaginary scandal. Leading the pack are former  papers of record  The New York Times and The Washington Post, flanked by America s premier broadcast TV propaganda outlet CNN.Last week, we revealed how powerful politicians in Washington had pressured Facebook executives to come up with any evidence to support the Democratic Party s theory of  Russian meddling,    demonstrating clear collusion between the Obama Administration and Silicon Valley corporation Facebook, with the goal of fabricating a scandal in order to scapegoat Vladimir Putin and the Russians for the electoral collapse of Hillary Clinton last November.As a result, US-Russian relations have been sacrificed at the altar of petty partisan politics and a failing deep state agenda.It certainly begs the question: with so much at stake, why would Washington and MSM lie and risk pushing global tensions closer to a world war level confrontation? If they are prepared to lie about this, what else are they prepared to lie about?Consortium News Exclusive: The U.S. mainstream media is determined to prove Russia-gate despite the scandal s cracking foundation and its inexplicable anomalies, such as why Russia would set up a Facebook  puppies  page.By Robert ParryWhat is perhaps most unprofessional, unethical and even immoral about the U.S. mainstream media s coverage of Russia-gate is how all the stories start with the conclusion    Russia bad    and then make whatever shards of information exist fit the preordained narrative.For instance, we re told that Facebook executives, who were sent back three times by Democratic lawmakers to find something to pin on Russia, finally detected $100,000 worth of ads spread out over three years from accounts  suspected of links to Russia  or similar hazy wording.These Facebook ads and 201 related Twitter accounts, we re told, represent the long-missing proof about Russian  meddling  in the U.S. presidential election after earlier claims faltered or fell apart under even minimal scrutiny.In the old days, journalists might have expressed some concern that Facebook  found  the ads only under extraordinary pressure from powerful politicians, such as Sen. Mark Warner, D-Virginia, the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and a leading legislator on the tech industry. But today s mainstream reporters took Warner s side and made it look like Facebook had been dragging its heels and that there must be much more out there.However, it doesn t really seem to matter how little evidence there is. Anything will do.Even the paltry $100,000 is not put in any perspective (Facebook has annual revenue of $27 billion), nor the 201 Twitter accounts (compared to Twitter s 328 million monthly users). Nor are the hazy allegations of  suspected   links to Russia  subjected to serious inspection. Although Russia is a nation of 144 million people and many divergent interests, it s assumed that everything must be personally ordered by President Vladimir Putin.Yet, if you look at some of the details about these $100,000 in ads, you learn the case is even flimsier than you might have thought. The sum was spread out over 2015, 2016 and 2017   and thus represented a very tiny pebble in a very large lake of Facebook activity.But more recently we learned that only 44 percent of the ads appeared before Americans went to the polls last November, according to Facebook; that would mean that 56 percent appeared afterwards.Facebook added that  roughly 25% of the ads were never shown to anyone.   For 50% of the ads, less than $3 was spent; for 99% of the ads, less than $1,000 was spent. So, as miniscule as the $100,000 in ad buys over three years may have seemed, the tiny pebble turns out really to be only a fraction of a tiny pebble if the Russians indeed did toss it into the 2016 campaign.What About the Puppies?We further have learned that most ads weren t for or against a specific candidate, but rather addressed supposedly controversial issues that the mainstream media insists were meant to divide the United States and thus somehow undermine American democracy.Except, it turns out that one of the issues was puppies.As Mike Isaac and Scott Shane of The New York Times reported in Tuesday s editions,  The Russians who posed as Americans on Facebook last year tried on quite an array of disguises.   There was even a Facebook group for animal lovers with memes of adorable puppies that spread across the site with the help of paid ads. Now, there are a lot of controversial issues in America, but I don t think any of us would put puppies near the top of the list. Isaac and Shane reported that there were also supposedly Russia-linked groups advocating gay rights, gun rights and black civil rights, although precisely how these divergent groups were  linked  to Russia or the Kremlin was never fully explained. (Facebook declined to offer details.)At this point, a professional journalist might begin to pose some very hard questions to the sources, who presumably include many partisan Democrats and their political allies hyping the evil-Russia narrative. It would be time for some lectures to the sources about the consequences for taking reporters on a wild ride in conspiracy land.Yet, instead of starting to question the overall premise of this  scandal,  journalists at The New York Times, The Washington Post, CNN, etc. keep making excuses for the nuttiness. The explanation for the puppy ads was that the nefarious Russians might be probing to discover Americans who might later be susceptible to propaganda. The goal of the dog lovers  page was more obscure,  Isaac and Shane acknowledged.  But some analysts suggested a possible motive: to build a large following before gradually introducing political content. Without viewing the entire feed from the page, now closed by Facebook, it is impossible to say whether the Russian operators tried such tactics. [Seriously, this is what the New York Times is passing off as  journalism  now]The Joe McCarthy of Russia-gateThe Times then turned to Clinton Watts, a former FBI agent and a top promoter of the New McCarthyism that has swept Official Washington. Watts has testified before Congress that almost anything that appears on social media these days criticizing a politician may well be traceable to the Russians Continue this story at Consortium NewsREAD MORE RUSSIAGATE NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Russiagate FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE  SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @ 21WIRE.TV",Middle-east,"October 5, 2017"
6973," White Crowd Chants ‘Donald Trump, Build That Wall!’ And Then The Black And Latina Players Did This","At a Wisconsin high school soccer game, players from the visiting team walked off the field as the home team crowd disgraced themselves with racist chants of  Donald Trump, build that wall! :BELOIT, Wis.  Officials from the Elkhorn Area School District are investigating racist taunts directed at Beloit Memorial High School soccer players by a group of its students attending a game.The incident happened Thursday night as the Beloit Memorial girls varsity soccer team visited Elkhorn.Beloit Memorial girls soccer coach Brian Denu said the Elkhorn students taunted black and Latina girls soccer players with racial slurs and chants like  Donald Trump, build that wall. Considering the young age of the students doing the chanting, it s hard to say if they actually meant what they were saying or if they just thought it would be a clever way to distract the opposing team. Either way, the effect was devastating: They came off the field and weren t able to finish the game because they were too upset and distraught over what happened to them,  Denu said. One of the girls was cradled in the arms of one of our assistant coaches for a good 15 to 20 minutes. Denu said even though the chants came from a small group of Elkhorn students, their words had a big impact on his players. I could just see the hurt and pain on their face and know that this was obviously something that they hadn t seen before,  Denu said.I want to give the benefit of the doubt but in all likelihood, this is the Trump Effect spilling down. It s not difficult to imagine that the parents of these students are ardent Trump supporters that have been gleefully teaching their children that it s OK to hate if the other person has dark skin. That is, after all, the core of Trump s popularity. It s not just that he s openly racist, he s telling his followers that it s permissible, encouraged even, for them to openly hate as well.School officials are looking into the incident but it s unclear if they will be able to do anything about it. At the very least, it would be nice if the other students from Elkhorn publicly shunned their fellow classmates for their racism.Featured image via AI archives",News,"April 11, 2016"
186, Milo Yiannopoulos Tells Aussies To Vote Against Marriage Equality Weeks After His Own Gay Wedding,"Milo Yiannopoulos will do anything to keep his name in the spotlight after his shameful resignation from his position as senior editor for Breitbart News back in February and now the homosexual far-right media troll has a new avenue   Trying to convince Australians to vote against marriage equality, despite marrying an unnamed man in a private ceremony in Hawaii just weeks ago.Australians are currently being asked by their federal government to take part in a postal vote to decide whether the law should be changed to allow same-sex couples to marry, as the law in Australia was altered in 2004 to define marriage as between a man and a woman. Surveys were sent out to Australians aged over 18 years of age and enrolled on the Commonwealth Electoral Role, with results of the mail-in only poll scheduled to be announced on November 15.The vote, coming at a cost of AU$122 million (US$94 million), has stirred up more than its fair share of controversy, with the nation divided over whether to vote  yes  or  no.  Surprisingly, Yiannopoulos has become a rather loud proponent for Australians to vote against same-sex marriage, just weeks after his own gay marriage. My gut would be to vote against it, Yiannopoulos told the Daily Mail, adding  I m gay and a Catholic. The highest priority for me is making sure no church, no believer anywhere, is required to violate their religious conscience. I think those things can co-exist perfectly peacefully. I think the state probably should recognize a gay couple who want to commit to one another,  He continued.  But the paramount consideration is not those gay couples   it is religious freedoms. Another fear that Yiannopoulos has is the effect same-sex marriage could have on gay culture.  One of the few advantages of being gay was that you could tumble out of a nightclub at 1am on a Tuesday and no one could have a go at you for it. But if we re buying into these institutions like marriage, I worry that there will be a deadening effect on gay culture. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but comments like these are more than just a little ironic when they come directly from the mouth of a man who recently had his own gay marriage. Photos surfaced of Yiannopoulos  marriage ceremony in Hualalai, Hawaii late last month, with his spouse named on Wikipedia as  John,  although little else is known.Yiannopoulos resigned from Breitbart in February of this year amid a cloud of controversy after a video emerged where he stated that the relationship between a man or woman and 13-year-old boys can be  perfectly consensual  and a positive experience for the boys.Featured image via Stephanie Keith/Getty Images",News,"October 26, 2017"

3221, WATCH: NY School Board Chair Just Delivered A BRUTAL F*ck You To Racist Trump Campaign Chair,"Recently, Donald Trump s New York campaign co-chair, Carl Paladino, did what Trump fans do best and made some incredibly racist remarks about the President and First Lady. Asked about his wish for Barack Obama by a weekly Buffalo, New York, paper, Paladino explained that he hoped Barack Obama would be caught having sex with a cow and die from Mad Cow Disease. As for Michelle, he explained that he wanted her to  return to being a male  and released in Africa to live among the apes.Naturally, Paladino s racist and hateful rhetoric   the exact sort that is, unfortunately, popular among the Stupid Part of America   didn t exactly make him friends outside of his racist little bubble. In fact, some (almost everyone) had a bit of an issue with the fact that he serves on the Buffalo school board. Words matter, Mr. Paladino,  School Board President Barbara Seals Nevergold said during a meeting intended to oust the Trump-loving bigot.  Our president, the Commander in Chief of this nation for the last eight years, Mrs. Obama, our First Lady, and Mrs. Valerie Jarrett, special presidential council [SIC] are all African-Americans. Among other things, they are accomplished, intelligent, beautiful people and that s not just my opinion. The impact on children of color, especially African-American children is incalculable,  she continued.  How do we encourage them to use their God-given talents to soar, to reach for the stars, when a sitting board member responsible for their education demonstrates such contempt of their role models?

8298, Here’s The One Thing That Scares Trump And His Racist Followers (VIDEO),"We are all aware by now of Donald Trump s racist rhetoric. One young but very intelligent and articulate student understands how the media can at times sensationalize everything, so he decided to see for himself by attending a Trump rally. His findings were not surprising: Trump s followers are very racist. James Patterson, whose high school assignment was for him to volunteer at Trump s campaign as part of a student-based civics activity, perfectly analyzes the Trump phenomenon and he exemplifies what racists are afraid of: The baseline of his campaign is to make America white again. It speaks to fundamentalist Christian, white middle class Americans who feel like their power has been taken. Even though that s a false accusation, they feel like because minorities are making strides that they re losing power. [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh8VGKqqunA]Patterson was also stunned to see just how many people actually support Donald Trump. He said: That s the scary part about the Trump campaign, they re everyday people, people we work with, people at schools, people who hold these resentments. As an African American, that s very scary  that I can talk to somebody and they can hate me because of my skin color. Patterson said that what concerned him the most was how nice people pretended to be to him, yet they were in favor of Trump s racist policies, policies that have come out against minority populations, specifically Muslims and Mexicans: They were very friendly, they were normal people but in the back of their mind, and openly, they were advocating for Trump s policies which are inherently exclusive for people who look like me. However, as he made his way through the crowd, Patterson said that the pretense of friendliness went away and he could feel the hostility: When I would bump into various members of the crowd, there were hostile looks when I would attempt to excuse myself. Many people in the crowd looked me up and down as I was walking. If I had to describe the feeling it would be that of isolation. This all reminded Patterson of what he s made to feel like as an African American in this country. The difference with Trump and his followers is that they normalize all this and make it fine.The most effective response to Trump and his racist army is for minorities to continue the march toward self-empowerment through education and activism. This young man is an excellent example and an effective counter punch to the racists. Featured image from Wikimedia Commons",News,"February 6, 2016"
7294," Elizabeth Warren Tears Trump Apart AGAIN, Praises Dem Candidates","Sen. Elizabeth Warren is on a roll with her brutal eviscerations of Donald Trump. Following her epic Twitter takedown of the racist billionaire earlier this week, Warren spoke to the Associated Press. It was during this interview that Warren once again took the opportunity to give the GOP presidential front-runner another tongue lashing. Warren also took a break from her avowed silence on the Democratic primary race to praise Bernie Sanders.Warren says that Trump s claims about his business successes are major exaggerations.  In reality, Trump s wealth comes from his father. Warren says that the only way that Trump has been able to retain his inheritance is by  cheating people  and  defrauding people.  Warren goes on to say: Donald Trump claims that the reason he s qualified to be president of the United States is that he is a very, very, very successful businessman. Donald Trump is not a great business success and it s time he s called on it. This isn t the first time Warren has called out Trump for his bad business decisions. Warren, a former Harvard Law professor, who specializes in bankruptcy law, wrote about Trump s nefarious failed business schemes. She also urged people to  listen to the experts who ve concluded he s so bad at business that he might have more money today if he d put his entire inheritance into an index fund and just left it alone. Warren also went on to note Trump s Mussolini quote gaffe.Warren also spent some time praising Bernie Sanders and the influence he has had on the Democratic Party and the nation. He s out there. He fights with the heart. This is who Bernie is. He has put the right issues on the table both for the Democratic Party and for the country in general so I m still cheering Bernie on. However, Warren does say that Clinton or Sanders would be far better leaders than what the GOP is offering. While the Democrats are saying,  Gee is the right answer to improve the Affordable Care Act in the following six ways or go all the way to single payer    which is a good debate to have   the Republicans are saying they are going to repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it with something they can t quite describe. Warren has not disclosed who she voted for in the primary election. However, she did make progressive politicos sitting on the edge of her seat, saying that she will make an endorsement. That being said, she didn t say is she plans on making an endorsement before the primary election is over. Should she do so, I guarantee it will be done at a key strategic moment in the race. Possibly before the Washington caucus or the New York primary. Though, a pre-nomination endorsement seems unlikely.You can read the AP interview with Warren here.Featured image from Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"March 25, 2016"
16335,BREAKING: DEVICE THAT BUSTED HILLARY CLINTON Discovered To Have Tens Of Thousands Of Emails,"Here s why Clinton and Abedin should be flipping out: Multiple State employees  told the FBI that they considered emailing Abedin  the equivalent of e-mailing Clinton.  Another close Clinton aide told the FBI that  Abedin may have kept emails that Clinton did not. The electronic device shared by Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin and husband Anthony Weiner on which the FBI found more Clinton emails was a laptop and it contained tens-of-thousands of emails, a senior law enforcement official told Fox News on Saturday.The FBI announced Friday that it had restarted an investigation into emails Clinton sent on a private server system while secretary of state, as a result of a probe into Abedin s husband, disgraced New York Democratic Rep. Anthony Weiner,  sexting,  of sending sexually-suggestive electronic messages, to a teenage girl.The law enforcement official told Fox News that the laptop had  five digits  of emails, meaning tens-of-thousands of them. However, federal investigators remain unclear whether Abedin or Weiner own the laptop.The FBI conducted a roughly two-year investigation into Clinton s use of a private server system, finding several emails marked as classified and concluded that she had been  extremely careless.  However, the agency did not find evidence that Clinton had been criminally negligent and did not recommend criminal charges to the Justice Department.People familiar with the case say it was restarted by the FBI because the agency thought the new emails were  pertinent to the investigation. The source also told Fox News that law enforcement officials think it s highly unlikely that all of the new-found emails are duplicates, as the Clinton campaign has suggested.Read more: FOX News",Government News,"Oct 29, 2016"
18296,BOOM! ACTOR JAMES WOODS Has Hilarious Response To Angry Feminist MSNBC Host’s Criticism Of Ivanka’s “Girly” Dress,"The hate for the Trump family by the defeated liberal press is visceral MSNBC political analyst Joan Walsh, a self-proclaimed feminist, questioned what  message  Ivanka Trump was trying to send at the G20 Summit by wearing a pink  girly  dress with bows.Walsh suggested that the dress Trump chose when sitting in for her father at the summit made her look like  property  and undermined her own value. I don t mean to sound sexist, it can be dangerous to comment on what women wear, but the fact that she sat in for her father in a dress that was so incredibly ornamental was such a contradiction,  Walsh said.  In patriarchal, authoritarian societies, daughters have great value. They are property. I think it s really pretty frightening,  she continued.  It s a pink dress with big bows on the elbows that s not a dress that s made for work. MSNBC host Thomas Roberts pushed back and asked if Walsh was suggesting that women can not dress in a feminine manner and be taken seriously. You can be a feminist and be girly, we all have our girly days, but showing up, taking your father s seat in a pink dress with big bows on the sleeves is a really interesting message,  Walsh argued.

5952, Target Women’s Bathroom Is Bombed Amid Transphobic Right-Wing Protests (VIDEO),"Police are investigating a possible hate crime after a bomb went off inside a women s restroom in Target.On Wednesday, law enforcement responded to the Target retail store in Evanston, Illinois after a small explosive device went off inside the women s bathroom. No one was hurt and the damage was minor, but authorities are looking into whether or not this was a hate crime.According to WGN:Early indications are that a plastic bottle was used but no projectiles like nails or tacks were inside it. Investigators are gathering evidence including examining store security camera video.For months, conservatives have been viciously protesting the retail giant over the decision to let transgender customers use the bathroom that corresponds to their gender identity.An online petition to boycott Target has been signed by over 1 million people and right-wingers have literally entered the store to harass employees and customers with annoying religious rhetoric and hate speech.Here s the video via WGN.The hate against the LGBT community has reached fever pitch in many red states, where Republicans have passed and enacted discriminatory laws allowing business owners to refuse service to LGBT people if they have a  sincere religious belief. It would certainly not be surprising if the perpetrator of this bombing ends up being a disgruntled right-wing bigot. After all, they are the only one obsessed with stopping people from using the women s bathroom and this bomb certainly achieved that goal, albeit temporarily.Conservatives certainly better hope that one of their own rabid extremists isn t responsible for this act of terrorism.Because if that turns out to be the case, then right-wing nut jobs would have proven themselves far more dangerous to women s safety in bathrooms than transgender people have ever posed since there has not been one instance of a transgender person sexually assaulting a woman in the bathroom across the 17 states and over 200 cities that have protections in place for transgender people.Featured image via screen capture",News,"June 9, 2016"

Is that racist as well? When will Disney owned ESPN figure out their fans aren t watching for their ignorant, racist commentary? ESPN Magazine  senior writer Howard Bryant argued in has latest column that police officers and military personnel should not sing the national anthem before sporting events.But it s not because he thinks they have bad voices   but rather because it amounts to a display of  staged patriotism  signaling an  authoritarian shift at the ballpark. Why don t more athletes speak out on behalf of their communities?  Bryant wrote.  Perhaps more of them would if there wasn t a chilling force looming over them. Bryant s column became a subject on a  Fox and Friends Weekend  segment, and the gang totally disagreed with him.Anna Kooiman noted that Bryant had written similar columns, in which he took the exception to  doing the flyovers and singing the national anthem and  God Bless America. In today s political climate, where kids in some district can t recite the Pledge of Allegiance, she asked  What is the problem here with expressing some patriotism? It s not forced patriotism! Peter Doocy said that, according to Bryant, these displays are  feeding into the 9/11 hero narrative,  which butts heads with the Black Lives Matter movement.He does not believe that police officers on 9/11 were heroes,  he said, and then wondered why a sporting magazine was opining about politics in the first place.

Tuesday morning at Orrs Elementary School, 10-year-old Jason Newberry said he and one classmate put their hand over their heart while reciting the Pledge of Allegiance. He said when they did, others in the class called them names. Me and him got called KKK, Nazi, and we just kept getting bullied the whole day,  said Newberry.Newberry said it wasn t until his second-period teacher showed them a news clip of NFL players kneeling that he realized the present controversy surrounding the flag.The teacher made a poll on paper and passed it out to all the students to see what they thought was right or wrong about taking a knee. The teacher even told students that she would never stand for the Pledge of Allegiance and that if she did stand she would not really mean it.A spokesperson for Spalding School District tells CBS46 the assignment was supposed to be a lesson on First Amendment Rights, but they wouldn t say if the teacher was disciplined for her comments.In a letter sent home to parents Wednesday, the teacher wrote the following: I apologize for expressing my views to my students. I recognize that while this was not a one-sided lesson, the topic itself and the expression of my views were not appropriate, my intentions were well-meaning.Parents say they plan to stand with their children Thursday morning in front of the school s flagpole when the National Anthem is recited over the loudspeaker.

18517,FEDS: Dozens of Muslim Girls had Genitals Mutilated at Michigan Clinic…The Landmark Defense is Shocking,"Changing the name of something doesn t change the TRUTH of what it is female genital mutilation is the name used for the secretive practice in the Muslim world  of making sure young girls never have a chance to feel sexual pleasure. It is a horrific practice of destroying the genitals of a girl to make sure she isn t promiscuous. A doctor in Michigan was doing this under the radar on as many as 100 girls. We cannot accept this as a  religious and cultural right  as the lawyers for this doctor are trying to do. Freedom of religion doesn t include the criminal act of mutilating a woman s genitals. This is what the lawyer said to defend this horrible practice: The defense has argued that the Attars did not engage in any criminal act and that the procedure at issue is a protected religious rite-of-passage that involves no cutting, but rather a ***scraping of genital membrane. They also argued the Attars are not a danger to the society and have no reason or desire to flee, convincing U.S. District Judge Bernard Friedman to release them on bond.***The  scraping  comment is a lie. The girls were looked over by a doctor who said the injuries were far worse that first thought.Here s the latest:A federal prosecutor dropped a bombshell in court Wednesday, telling a federal judge that the government estimates that as many as 100 girls may have had their genitals cut at the hands of a local doctor and her cohorts.Assistant U.S. Attorney Sara Woodward disclosed the information while trying to convince a judge to keep a doctor and his wife locked up in the historic case. It involves allegations that two Minnesota girls had their genitals cut at a Livonia clinic in February as part of a religious rite of passage and were told to keep what happened a secret. Due to the secretive nature of this procedure, we are unlikely to ever know how many children were cut by Dr. (Jumana) Nagarwala,  Woodward said, referring to the lead defendant in the case, later adding,  The Minnesota victims were not the first victims.

10401,LIST OF 24 REPUBLICANS Who Voted “YES” To KEEP Obama’s Taxpayer-Funded Sex-Change Surgeries In Place For Transgenders In Military,"If you re not okay with taxpayers paying for exorbitant medical costs, including transgender surgeries for military members, you ll want to remember these names in 2018 A majority in the House voted down a proposal to restrict funding for transgender members of the military, standing by social policy changes enacted by the Pentagon under former President Barack Obama.Rep. Vicky Hartzler, R-Mo., succeeded in forcing a vote, arguing that Obama s  transgender decision is costly in dollars and short on common sense.  The attempted rollback failed on a 209-214 vote, however, as 24 Republicans joined a unanimous Democratic caucus in opposing the proposal. The Obama transgender policy, which was implemented without input from members of Congress, is ill-conceived and contrary to our goals of increasing troop readiness and investing defense dollars into addressing budget shortfalls of the past,  Hartzler said in June.  By recruiting and allowing transgender individuals to serve in our military we are subjecting taxpayers to high medical costs including up to $130,000 per transition surgery, lifetime hormone treatments, and additional surgeries to address the high percentage of individuals who experience complications. Her amendment would have barred the Defense Department from  provid[ing] medical treatment (other than mental health treatment) related to gender transition  to members of the military. Proponents of transgender military service argued that her proposal  would reduce military readiness  by discouraging transgender Americans from serving. It would have a negative impact on morale, a negative impact on retention and move us away from the merit-based system which we now have, where we have one set of rules applied to everybody,  Rep. Jared Polis, D-Colo., who co-chairs the LGBT Equality Caucus, said Wednesday.Hartzler maintained that her amendment would increase readiness, however.  The deployability of individuals going through the sex transition process is highly problematic, requiring 210 to 238 work days where a soldier is non-deployable after surgery,  she said.  This recovery time equates to 1.4 million manpower days where transgender personnel cannot deploy and fight our nation s wars, therefore relying on an already stressed force to pick up the burden. It makes no sense to purposely recruit individuals who cannot serve.

3255, This Single Anecdote Tells You EVERYTHING You Need To Know About Trump Voters,"While pundits have been busily dissecting exactly what went wrong for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election, it s becoming increasingly clear that in our  post-fact world,  it was lies, propaganda and the unwillingness of the mainstream media to point out the difference that propelled Donald Trump toward the presidency.The Atlantic spoke to people in Elkhart, Indiana, which has boomed since Obama took office in 2009. Unfortunately, residents of Elkhart seem not to know it, and neither do most Trump voters. Despite the fact that the U.S. economy has been on a constant trajectory of growth, almost since the day President Barack Obama took office, the vast majority of Republicans thought the economy has been horrible under Obama. Who can blame them? That s all Donald Trump and Fox News have been saying. The funny thing is, though, that immediately after the election, nearly half of Republicans thought the economy was getting better.In Elkhart, even the people who would acknowledge that things are getting better for them refuse to give Obama credit for it. They do seem willing to give Trump credit, though, despite the fact that he s done nothing yet. These two paragraphs from the article are going viral and they offer a big glimpse into the minds of Trump supporters:Andi Ermes, 39, offered a number of reasons for disliking Obama. She said Obama didn t attend the Army-Navy football game, even though other presidents had. Obama has actually attended more Army-Navy games than George H.W. Bush. She said that he had taken too many vacations. He has taken fewer vacation days that George W. Bush. She also said that he refused to wear a flag pin on his lapel. While it is true that Obama did not wear a flag on his lapel at points during the 2007 campaign, it was back on his suit by 2008. Ermes told me the news sources she consumes most are Fox News, Rush Limbaugh, and a local conservative radio show hosted by Casey Hendrickson.Perhaps unsurprisingly, Ermes sees the biggest signs for hope in the economy in Carrier deal struck by Donald Trump, which will keep 1,000 jobs in the U.S.  He s not even president yet and already he s helping the economy,  she said.Of course, the Carrier deal was just another Trump lie. Far fewer than the originally touted 1,000 jobs were saved in the Carrier deal, which was just a tax break. President Obama, on the other hand, saved 1.2 million jobs with very little fanfare.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images.",News,"December 27, 2016"

15874,NO TOILET PAPER?! SOCIALISM IS IN ITS FINAL STAGES FOR VENEZUELA SO BYOTP,"Socialism doesn t work but I guess Venezuela didn t get the memo. No toilet paper? No food? Yes, it s come to that in this socialist hellhole Venezuela s product shortages have become so severe that some hotels in that country are asking guests to bring their own toilet paper and soap, a local tourism industry spokesman said on Wednesday .  It s an extreme situation,  says Xinia Camacho, owner of a 20-room boutique hotel in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada national park.  For over a year we haven t had toilet paper, soap, any kind of milk, coffee or sugar. So we have to tell our guests to come prepared.  Montilla says bigger hotels can circumvent product shortages by buying toilet paper and other basic supplies from black market smugglers who charge up to 6-times the regular price. But smaller, family-run hotels can t always afford to pay such steep prices, which means that sometimes they have to make do without. Camacho says she refuses to buy toilet paper from the black market on principle.  In the black market you have to pay 110 bolivares [$0.50] for a roll of toilet paper that usually costs 17 bolivares [$ 0.08] in the supermarket,  Camacho told Fusion.  We don t want to participate in the corruption of the black market, and I don t have four hours a day to line up for toilet paper  at a supermarket . Recently, Venezuelan officials have been stopping people from transporting essential goods across the country in an effort to stem the flow of contraband. So now Camacho s guests could potentially have their toilet paper confiscated before they even make it to the hotel. Shortages, queues, black markets, and official theft. And blaming the CIA. Yes, Venezuela has truly achieved socialism.But what I never understood is this: Why toilet paper? How hard is it to make toilet paper? I can understand a socialist economy having trouble producing decent cars or computers. But toilet paper? And soap? And matches?Sure, it s been said that if you tried communism in the Sahara, you d get a shortage of sand.

6242," Ben Carson Gets Humiliating Trump Campaign Demotion – Claims He Requested it, Fools No One","Ben Carson was (very) briefly the Republican frontrunner for President of the United States   and now he s getting demoted by Donald Trump s campaign for being too big a liability. The campaign which once tweeted a picture of Trump eating a taco bowl with the caption  I love Hispanics  thinks Carson makes them look bad.And sadly, they re probably right.Ben Carson has managed to step on every rake in the yard in his bumbling attempt to help Trump get elected president. He s confided to reporters (on the record) that Trump might make a terrible president, but at least  we re only looking at four years. How bad has Carson been for Trump? Dubbing him the  worst surrogate ever  CBS News  Emily Schultheis pegged Carson early on:A campaign surrogate s job is to travel across the country and go on TV, saying nice things about the candidate and helping boost his or her chances at the presidency.What a campaign surrogate is not, however, supposed to do, is suggest their candidate is a bad person, admit he has a Twitter problem and an issue with  humility,  defend that candidate by suggesting a TV anchor has been charged with a crime, and reassure skeptics that, even if your candidate is a terrible president, it s only for four years.So when Carson made headlines yet again for screwing up   this time naming a list of potential vice presidents Trump was considering including Alaskan campaign death knell Sarah Palin   Carson was removed from the vice presidential planning group. Or as Carson s spin team meekly put it, he asked to be removed because he had many more super important jobs to do.That lie was exposed in less than a week. The real story is that Trump kicked Carson to the curb because Carson had absolutely no idea what he was doing.Three sources close to the Trump campaign said Carson didn t leave on his own. He was pushed.According to sources close to Trump s campaign, Carson was demoted after Trump specifically wanted him to head up the VP selection team. He submitted names that he thought would be valuable picks and inevitably lost his top spot days later. Carson allegedly called Trump afterwards and was angry that the situation played out like this.At this point, it s hard not to feel bad for Carson. Having seen the highs of being a front-runner, Carson got smoked in Iowa thanks to a vicious lie spread by Ted Cruz. Later he would be pulled into a literal closet to hear Ted Cruz tell him  sorry not sorry.  Only to finally give up and throw his lot in with Trump   a man who once called him a pathological liar barely above a child molester. Now that same man is firing him and only because Carson s mouth almost never bothers communicating with his brain before saying things like  He has some major defects, there s no question about it, just like the rest of us. But before we let Carson s sadsack routine tug on our heartstrings, let s remember that this is a man who ran for president on the premise that the Egyptian pyramids were grain silos only to give up and throw his weight behind a man he seems to have nothing but contempt for just to cling a bit longer to the political spotlight. Carson s right about one thing, he does have major defects.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"May 21, 2016"
7180, The Math Behind Why Trump Will NEVER Be President,"I m often told that Trump can beat Hillary, and therefore she shouldn t be the nominee. It s a good argument;  electability  and all that, but it s not true. Even slightly. In fact, never mind Hillary, we could nominate a potted plant on the left and Trump would STILL lose.How can I be so sure? Easy: Trump has to win 70% of the white male vote to become president.Good fucking luck with that.I know what you re thinking: Trump appeals directly to white resentment, how could he not have the angry white male vote totally locked up? Honestly, he probably does. This is something that, as a white male myself, I find incredibly annoying. That more than half of all white males would support such a piece of trash is embarrassing to say the least. But more than half is not the same as 70%.No one gets 70% of the white male vote. No. One.That s a larger percentage than Republicans have ever won before   more than the GOP won in the landslide victories of Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, and far more than they won during the racially polarized elections of Barack Obama.Of course, the argument often made by Trump s followers is that he will win in November because he will bring so many disengaged Americans to the polls. But they re talking about disengaged white voters, mostly mostly men   and unfortunately for him, the turnout rate for white men is already relatively high. Got that? Even when White America went completely insane at the idea of a black president, they STILL couldn t muster more than the 63% Reagan and Poppy Bush took in 1980 and 1988 or the 62% Dubya got in 2004. More importantly, as the country gets less lily white, even that 60%+ is losing its punch:By 2004, however, winning 62 percent of white men barely got George W. Bush past John Kerry in a squeaker. And eight years later, Romney won 62 percent of white men and lost to Barack Obama by 3.5 million votes.So what happened? Between Reagan and Romney, the white male share of the total vote had dropped from 45 percent to 35 percent.Ironically, the very thing Trump is harnessing to propel his campaign, white resentment at the waning of white supremacy, is what will ensure he can never win. It s such a thing a beauty that I want to redefine marriage again so I can walk it down the aisle.If you want a full breakdown of why Trump needs 70% of white men and how women, Latinos and black voters spell his doom, take a look at Politico s excellent analysis.Featured image via AI archives ",News,"March 31, 2016"

Tuberculosis is a very dangerous disease that can spread easily, due to the public health threat Arizona Revised Statutes and good public health practice dictates that we provide healthcare to treat tuberculosis for anyone residing in our county (other than those incarcerated) as a result when the ICE facility releases this individual he will be treated at the local tax payers  expense,  he stated.  From a public health perspective it is essential that anyone who is suffering from TB be treated so they are not a health threat to others, I request that ICE pay the costs of those who are released from their facility.

2360," Jon Stewart Brilliantly Reveals Trump’s MAJOR Character Flaw, And It’s SO True (VIDEO)","Jon Stewart may not be routinely commenting on America s politics anymore, but he certainly hasn t stepped away from the spotlight. Last night, Stewart took a break from his personal projects to hijack Stephen Colbert s The Late Show, where he couldn t resist weighing in on Donald Trump.During the show, Stewart nailed a personality trait of Trump s that shows just how untrustworthy Trump is. While it s well known that Trump lies through his teeth every chance he gets (he was also proven to be the most dishonest presidential candidate last year), there s one behavior of Trump s that gives it all away   and Stewart pointed this out perfectly. Mocking one of Trump s most obvious speech patterns, Stewart said: Nobody says  believe me  unless they are lying. He elaborated: Trump lies more in one press conference than CNN does in a year. And this is coming from a guy, who as you know, hates CNN. Stewart also had some equally harsh words for the media, and advised the press that it should  get its groove back  and stop latching onto Trump s every attack. Stewart said to the media: Let s face facts. You kind of let yourself go a little bit these past few years, put on a few pundits, obsessing 24 hours a day, seven days a week, about this one guy:  What s Donnie up to? Did he say anything about us? You think he s gonna come on our show?' Stewart compared the behavior between Trump and the media to a bad breakup, and suggested that it was an opportunity for improvement. Stewart said,  Take up a hobby. I recommend journalism! Colbert asked Stewart if he felt the press would actually do some self-reflection and improve, and Stewart joked, I really do   believe me.

17547,“DONALD TRUMP DIET”…LIFELONG LIBERAL Tells  How His Leftist Friends Caused Him To Lose 7 Pounds After He Defended Donald Trump [VIDEO],"Every single day, liberals provide more and more evidence that Donald Trump Derangement Syndrome is a real thing. After the treatment liberal Harvard Law School professor emeritus Alan Dershowitz received from his leftist friends for defending the law, and in the process defending President Trump, will he ever be able to embrace the people he used to believe were  tolerant  and  open-minded ?  WFB   Harvard Law School professor emeritus Alan Dershowitz said Friday that he has lost seven pounds because his liberal friends have stopped inviting him to dinner parties for defending President Donald Trump against Democrats calling for him to be charged with obstruction of justice. Fox and Friends  co-host Ainsley Earhardt asked Dershowitz, a lifelong liberal who has donated thousands of dollars to Democrats, about liberals shunning him, noting that he usually agrees with liberals when he appears on the show. Well, I call it the Donald Trump diet,  Dershowitz said with a smile.  I ve lost seven pounds because my liberal friends have stopped inviting me to dinner parties. After four years, I ll be back to my high school weight. He added that many liberals do not want to understand his view and immediately accuse him of being on Trump s side.WATCH: I m on nobody s side. I m on the side of the rule of law, the Constitution, and the Constitution is clear [that if] a president exercises his constitutional authority by firing somebody or by pardoning somebody, that cannot be the basis for obstruction of justice,  Dershowitz said.  If he goes further and lies or tells his people to destroy evidence, of course, that s different. That s how [Richard] Nixon and [Bill] Clinton got in trouble, but President [Trump] cannot be charged with obstruction for simply exercising his Article 2 power under the Constitution. And that s the point of view you expressed on this program a couple of days ago,  co-host Steve Doocy added.  And then the president of the United States retweeted,  Hey you should watch Alan Dershowitz on Fox and Friends make that case,  but then your liberal friends, their heads started exploding, and I understand somebody even suggested that you re being paid off by the Trump people. Dershowitz mocked the idea that he is being paid off or that he wants to become a Supreme Court justice at the age of 79. He then mentioned that he also is being attacked for his article supporting Trump s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital. I m being criticized for that by people because that s what Trump said, and if Trump said it, that means Dershowitz can t say it because that means Dershowitz is on Trump s side,  Dershowitz said.

Remember to discuss this story with your liberal friends when they gush about how Hillary  won CNN s debate.  Hillary won the hearts of progressives and the media when she attempted to brand herself  the most progressive candidate  on the stage. A spate of Islamist graffiti in the multiculturalist Swedish city Gothenburg has been compared to the harassment of the Jewish community in Germany in the 1930s, with Christian business owners being told to  convert or die .The threats are yet another conflict imported to Europe from the Levant, as the Assyrian Christian Asmar family awoke to find their pizza parlour had been daubed with threats in red paint. Their experience is becoming increasingly common in the city, as legitimate asylum seekers fleeing persecution find it has followed them to Northern Europe, thanks to Sweden s open door immigration policy.The Goteborgs-Posten records the remarks of the local Assyrian association s president:  Imagine yourself having fled from persecution in a country and then to find yourself staying next door to ISIS sympathizers here in Sweden.

There is no doubt that it is directed at me as a Christian and Assyrian  It feels like persecution of Jews in the 30s when Jews in Germany had Stars of David painted on its doors.

786," BAD NEWS For Trump: Memo Proves He Is Not Above The Law, Can Be Indicted","If Donald Trump thinks being president means he can t be prosecuted for his crimes, he should think again.As it turns out, Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller has the power to indict Trump if he has enough evidence proving that Trump committed a criminal act such as colluding with Russia in an effort to win the 2016 Election. Donald Trump s son Trump Jr. has already demonstrated that Trump s campaign met with a Kremlin-linked Russian lawyer and a former Soviet Intelligence officer in order to get dirt to use against Hillary Clinton, which is, indeed, the very definition of collusion.Mueller s power to indict is confirmed by a 56-page legal memo written by Ronald Rotunda, a conservative professor of constitutional law and ethics, who was hired as part of Special Prosecutor Kenneth Starr s team during the Bill Clinton presidency.According to the 1998 memo, which was obtained by the New York Times,It is proper, constitutional, and legal for a federal grand jury to indict a sitting president for serious criminal acts that are not part of, and are contrary to, the president s official duties. In this country, no one, even President Clinton, is above the law.That means no sitting president is above the law, including Trump.Watergate special counsel, Leon Jaworski, came to the same conclusion in 1974.The only reason why Jaworski and Starr declined to indict President Nixon and President Clinton is because they chose to let impeachment proceedings play out instead.Well, Republicans have thus far done everything they can to protect Trump from being impeached. So it appears Mueller may not have a choice but to indict Trump if Republicans continue to refuse to do their public duty.Even the Supreme Court has ruled that sitting presidents are not above the law by deciding in 1997 that a lawsuit against Clinton for misconduct prior to becoming president can move forward. And since Trump was not president when he and his campaign colluded with Russia, that makes his misconduct open to indictment, along with any other crimes he committed prior to taking office. That means if Mueller digs through Trump s finances and finds other crimes, Trump could face an indictment for those as well. If there is no recourse against the president, if he cannot be prosecuted for violating the criminal laws, he will be above the law,  Rotunda further wrote. If public policy and the Constitution allow a private litigant to sue a sitting president for acts that are not part of the president s official duties (and are outside the outer perimeter of those duties), and that is what Clinton v. Jones squarely held, then one would think that an indictment is constitutional because the public interest in criminal cases is greater. In short, Trump is in deep shit and he can t blame Hillary Clinton to get out of it. Not even Republicans can dispute the Starr memo. Republicans not only supported Starr s investigation, it was a conservative legal mind who wrote the memo.So unless Republicans proceed with impeachment proceedings to get to the bottom of this once and for all, Robert Mueller must indict Trump. Because it is clear that Republicans won t punish Trump for breaking the law and violating the Constitution.Featured Image: Addicting Info Archive",News,"July 22, 2017"

Chutkan, an Obama appointee, recused herself on Monday from a case involving a dispute over subpoenas issued for Fusion GPS, the firm that commissioned the dossier.This Obama appointee is like so many others controversial. Change.org has a petition calling for her impeachmentA SUPPORTER COMMENT OF THE PETITION:  There is Clear and Present Danger, in our Government and to our Country. Judge Chutkin needs to do her duty, as Sworn by Oath, to let in ALL of the evidence pertaining to Imran Awan and Hina Alvi. As it stands today, 9/12/2017, Judge Chutkin is not doing her duty to protect the interests and lives of the Citizens of The United States. For this reason, I am standing with others, shoulder to shoulder, and calling for the Removal and Impeachment of Federal District Judge Tanya S. Chutkin. Aleksej Gubarev, a Russian tech executive accused in the dossier of hacking Democrats  computer systems, has sought to subpoena Fusion GPS records and to depose its employees to find out more about the research firm s work on the dossier.Gubarev is suing BuzzFeed for defamation for publishing the dossier earlier this year. He denies the allegations laid out in the document, which was written by former British spy Christopher Steele.Chutkan recused herself last month from another case involving Fusion GPS. The firm had filed suit against its bank, TD Bank, to keep it from complying with a subpoena issued by the House Intelligence Committee, which sought Fusion s bank records.Chutkan presided over that case from Oct. 20 to Nov. 9. It was reassigned to Judge Richard Leon, a George W. Bush appointee. Since taking over the case, Leon has indicated that he plans to allow more transparency into the court proceedings involving the battle over Fusion s bank records. He has ordered several documents be unsealed and made public.Chutkan has presided over the case involving the lawsuit against BuzzFeed since Aug. 31. Her replacement is Trevor McFadden, a Trump appointee who assumed office in October.The reasons for Chutkan s recusals remain a mystery Chutkan refused to comment on the recusal but her work with a medical technology firm also represented by Fusion GPS could be the reason.In any case, this is yet another case of the Obama hand in just about everything that has to do with corruption and intel agencies.Read more: Daily Caller",Government News,"Dec 16, 2017"

Could someone tell Obama he doesn t need to dump more money into the Baltimore school system. I think they need to point the finger somewhere else The Baltimore school system ranked second among the nation s 100 largest school districts in how much it spent per pupil in fiscal year 2011, according to data released Tuesday by the U.S. Census Bureau.The city s $15,483 per-pupil expenditure was second to New York City s $19,770. Rounding out the top five were Montgomery County, which spent $15,421; Milwaukee public schools at $14,244; and Prince George s County public schools, which spent $13,775.The Census Bureau also noted the first decrease in per-pupil spending nationally since 1977, the year the figures were first tracked.The per-pupil expenditures were calculated based on taking the districts  current spending on day-to-day operations and deducting payments to charter schools and capital funding. The remaining money was divided by the number of students enrolled in traditional schools. The amounts were not adjusted for inflation.Baltimore schools CEO Andr s Alonso said the city s total could have reflected large infusions of cash to the district, including millions in federal stimulus dollars and federal Race to the Top funds.He also credited state lawmakers for maintaining funding. As many states pulled back on spending, with many districts losing funding, Maryland held the line on education, which is why you see three districts at or near the top,  he said.On Monday, the school board passed a $1.2 billion budget that includes per-pupil funding of $5,190. That amount is different from what the Census Bureau reported because the school system takes out other expenses, such as transportation costs and special-education services, before allocating money to individual schools. In addition, the school system provides extra funding for certain groups of students, such as those in special education and dropout-prevention programs.Via: Baltimore Sun",left-news,"Apr 30, 2015"

1438, WATCH: Republican Analyst Who Worked For Nixon Says Trump Is In Impeachment Territory,"If anybody knows when a president is qualified for impeachment, it s David Gergen.After all, he worked in the Nixon Administration.Donald Trump s Russia scandal has gotten even bigger over the last week. Just a day after firing FBI Director James Comey, Trump met with Russian officials in the Oval Office and leaked highly classified information and compromised the source of that intelligence and our own national security.And now, there s a memo written by Comey noting that Trump asked him to drop the Russia investigation.Interestingly enough, it s the memo that could end up bringing Trump down.You see, asking the head of a federal agency to drop an investigation and then firing that person later on for refusing to do so is the very definition of obstruction of justice and impeding an investigation.As it turns out, obstruction of justice is what led to impeachment proceedings against former President Richard Nixon during the Watergate scandal.Republican analyst David Gergen delivered that explanation during a segment on CNN on Tuesday.When Anderson Cooper asked Gergen to weigh in, the longtime Republican said that Trump has entered  impeachment territory. I was in the Nixon Administration as you know and I thought after watching the Clinton impeachment, I thought I would never see another one,  Gergen began.  But I think we re in impeachment territory for the first time. The obstruction of justice was the number one charge against Nixon that brought him down. Obstruction of justice was the number one charge against Bill Clinton,  Gergen continued. It looks like he was trying to impede the investigation. He was using his power to do that, and when James Comey didn t go along with him, when he wasn t his boy, he fired him This is of enormous consequence for his presidency. Gergen then concluded that all the bombshells dropped over the last week, including Comey s firing, sharing classified intelligence with the Russians, and the revelation that Trump asked Comey to drop the investigation are causing Trump s presidency to unravel. What we see is a presidency that s starting to come apart,  Gergen said.Here s the video via YouTube.It is now clear that Trump fired Comey because he refused to drop the investigation. That is obstruction of justice and should result in Trump being impeached. Of course, Republicans in Congress have no interest in impeaching Trump. That would require having the courage and a soul.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"May 17, 2017"

18828,FUTURE SNOWFLAKE ALERT! Little Girl Gets Birthday Wish: A Poop-Themed Birthday Party,"And we wonder how we keep producing snowflakes? You know, the kind of college kids that can t take no for an answer. They live in their own world and don t take direction or follow social mores.Just wondering why this mom wouldn t fill this little girl in on how this might now be such a great idea and why Not cute but kinda gross, right?Nothing says you love your child more than saying no and gently guiding them to do the right thing It s never too early to start!FUTURE SNOWFLAKE ALERT!A 3-year-old girl in Missouri named Audrey had every immature adult s dream: a poop-themed birthday party.Audrey s mother, Rebecca, said she went all out for her daughter s second birthday, decorating a pumpkin patch and  going a little crazy,  she told Babble. So for the next year, she decided she would do whatever Audrey wanted. For months, every time we mentioned her party, Audrey requested  poop balloons and a poop cake,  the mom told The Huffington Post.  I tried suggesting other themes, but she always insisted on poop. So eventually her mom gave in and decided to have a poo-poo party.But, being an enthusiastic and good mother, this mom didn t just settle for balloons and a cake. Instead, she went all out, getting a poop pinata, a poop cake, poop cookies, poop costumes, whoopie cushions and a game called  pin the poop,  per Fox 13. Think pin the tail on the donkey, but with a toilet and some feces-themed stickers. Audrey herself wore a shirt with the poop emoji on it. In the pi ata, the mom placed Tootsie Rolls, Hershey Kisses and other brown candies. I expected the grandparents to question it, but they all just laughed when I told them She just happens to really, really like poop. I don t think it ever even occurred to her that it was a strange request  As for those who think such a party may be weird or even disturbing, well, this mom doesn t give a crap. This party wasn t for me, it was for Audrey. I love that we will look back at pictures, and it will represent her at 3   my funny and quirky little girl I will never forget how excited she was when she came down the stairs and saw everything   To see how happy she was, was totally worth whatever embarrassment I felt wearing a poop costume.Read more: Charlotte Observer",left-news,"Apr 13, 2017"

19695,HERE’S HOW THE CLINTONS’ Free Private Jet Scam Works: “It’s highly illegal”," It s highly illegal and it s likely that the owners of these aircraft took tax deductions as a gift to the Clinton Foundation,  Charles Ortel, a Wall Street analyst and critic of the Clinton FoundationIra Magaziner, the CEO of the Clinton Health Access Initiative, asked former President Bill Clinton to thank Morocco s King Mohammed VI for  offering his plane to the conference in Ethiopia. CHAI would like to request that President Clinton call Sheik Mohammed to thank him for offering his plane to the conference in Ethiopia,  Magaziner gushed in a November 22, 2011 email released by WikiLeaks.Clinton frequently has expected free, luxurious private jet travel during his post-presidential life. Clinton, his wife and daughter have artfully secured free air travel and luxurious accommodations since they left the White House. It s an effective way to accept gifts of great value without declaring them for the Clinton Foundation. It s highly illegal and it s likely that the owners of these aircraft took tax deductions as a gift to the Clinton Foundation,  Charles Ortel, a Wall Street analyst and critic of the Clinton Foundation.In the Moroccan case, Clinton was able to fly for free, jetting 3,367 miles from Rabat, Morocco, to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia on the King s specially equipped 747-400 jumbo jet.Not including the flight, King Mohammed has donated at least $28 million to the Clinton Foundation. Clinton was traveling to attend a conference organized by Sheikh Mohammed Hussein Al-Amoudi, an Ethiopian-Saudi billionaire who is the second wealthiest man in Saudi Arabia. The sheikh has donated up to $10 million to the Clinton Foundation. But neither the Clinton Foundation nor CHAI have listed any  non-cash contributions    such as free jumbo jet travel   on their 2011 tax return for the free use of the aircraft.Via: Daily Caller ",left-news,"Nov 1, 2016"
6997," Boston Globe Goes #NeverTrump On Its Front Page, You Have To See This (IMAGE)","The Boston Globe will publish a satirical front page on Sunday, April 10, showing just how insane the news could get if Donald Trump is elected President of the United States. The page is part of an effort by the paper s editorial department to get Republicans to break out of their stupor and to stop Trump on his path to the nomination.It is every much the nightmare scenario it sounds like:The banner headline on the fake page, dated a year from Sunday, reads:  Deportations to begin, President Trump calls for tripling of ICE force; riots continue.  The page includes full, realistic articles about Trump s actions as president.The main story includes mentions of an Attorney General Chris Christie, and Fox News  Megyn Kelly tweeting from a bar because she s been placed on a White House black list.Other stories on the fake front page include  U.S. soldiers refuse orders to kill ISIS families  and details such as new libel laws targeting  absolute scum  in the press. Another story is about how Trump had offended the Chinese first lady by naming his new dog after her.Here is an image of the front page, see a PDF here.An editor s note on the page explains their goals: This is Donald Trump s America. What you read on this page is what might happen if the GOP frontrunner can put his ideas into practice, his words into action.

Also featured in the issue is an editorial warning America off Trump:The GOP must stop TrumpDONALD J. TRUMP S VISION for the future of our nation is as deeply disturbing as it is profoundly un-American.Trump has experienced a recent series of setbacks on the delegate front, as the party s establishment attempts to deny him the number of representatives he needs at the convention in order to be granted the nomination. At the same time, much of the establishment is now backing the campaign of the far-right Senator Ted Cruz in a desperate attempt to blunt Trump s momentum.

5269, Trump SHREDS All Remaining Ideas That He’s Not An Egotistical Bastard In Latest Hillary Rant,"Nobody can accuse King Cheeto, a.k.a. Donald Trump, of being classy, even as he expects a classiness from his rivals that he ll never possess. At a rally in Colorado Springs, he bitched and moaned about Hillary s speech, especially how she didn t congratulate him, her worthy opponent, for being so amazingly worthy.Seriously. We wish we were making this up. Unfortunately, with Trump, stories that sound like they should be from The Onion are actually true: I was curious to see whether she would do a class act and not mention my name or mention it with respect.I would like to congratulate my Republican opponent for having something that nobody has ever done in the history of politics in this nation. And I would like to congratulate my opponent for having gotten more votes than anybody in the history of the Republican Party in the primary season. Really? Did he congratulate her for making history as well, as the first woman to secure the nomination of a major political party? No, at least, not anywhere we can find it. He went on a Twitter rant against her instead, accusing her of having terrible judgment, creating ISIS, and continuing to call her  Crooked Hillary. And he expects her to congratulate him? Please.Hillary instead told the world that  A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons,  and gave us this warning:  Don t believe anyone who says  I alone can fix it.'  She also said other things about Trump that he no doubt thinks are completely inappropriate. As if to emphasize his bruised little feelings on her lack of accolades blown in his direction, he also said: I thought she might do something like that. I thought she d give me a big, fat, beautiful congratulations. If she did that, wouldn t that be cool? Wouldn t that be great? She s a woman and she owes him at least that much, apparently. It s more than he d ever give her. But then again, he s the king of the planet. Or his planet, anyway. We must all pay homage to him.

10313,"IT BEGINS: ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI FIRES Suspected Leaker, Anti-Trumper With Ties To Reince Priebus","Scaramucci promised the heads of White House leakers would roll. He clearly wasn t kidding Suspected leaker Michael Short has been terminated from the White House communications office, Breitbart News can confirm. Short, an ally of White House chief of staff Reince Priebus and now former Press Secretary Sean Spicer who resigned last week was terminated on Tuesday by new White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci.Politico s Tara Palmeri was the first to report the news.Short disputes his resignations, says he was assigned to campaign from RNC and merely went back to the RNC to work for campaign from HQ https://t.co/bJ4XBtZR6a  Tara Palmeri (@tarapalmeri) July 25, 2017 Newly appointed White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci said on Tuesday that he plans to dismiss assistant press secretary Michael Short,  Palmeri wrote on Tuesday morning.  It would be Scaramucci s first step toward shaking up the communications shop, which has been dominated by former Republican National Committee staffers loyal to White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, a former RNC chairman. Short originally worked for the Trump campaign placed on it by Priebus and quit the campaign, sources tell Breitbart News, after the Access Hollywood tape came out. Politico confirmed this report, noting that Short walked out in the middle of the campaign leaving his computer behind only to show back up in January at the behest of the Republican National Committee (RNC) allies in the White House. He was scorned by many of his colleagues for quitting the Trump campaign, only to rejoin as a White House staffer because of Priebus,  Palmeri wrote of Short.  In a story often retold by campaign staffers, they arrived at Trump Tower one morning, months before the election, to see Short s computer left open on his otherwise empty desk. He had quit the campaign that day and never returned. The next time he was seen by former campaign staffers was in January on their first day in the White House, where some were stunned to learn that they were going to have to work alongside him or for some of the press assistants subordinate to him. Multiple White House sources tell Breitbart News that Short was a leaker, and worked closely with now former White House deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh another RNC wing official who was terminated earlier this year for her own suspected leaking.  Breitbart NewsCould Reince Priebus be next?Heavy   Could Short s and Spicer s resignations be a bad omen for the future of Priebus, the former RNC chairman turned chief of staff who once ran the Republican Party in Wisconsin?There certainly seems to be a diminishing in the ranks of his supporters inside the Trump bubble (and he was reported to have opposed the hiring of Scaramucci by The New York Times and other publications). However, Priebus and Scaramucci have publicly spoken positively about each other since Scaramucci was hired. Trump seems to be relying more than before on a tight circle of family members and political outsiders like Scaramucci. The potential shake-up has exacerbated long-simmering tensions between Scaramucci and chief of staff Reince Priebus,  reported The Washington Post.

Everyone that voted against Trump   which was the majority of Americans   likely felt combinations of disbelief, depression, disgust, fear, and anger that such an unqualified, undeserving human being could somehow come out on top despite losing the popular vote.Recently on the WTF podcast, singer Bruce Springsteen summed up how many of us feel about Trump s upcoming presidency perfectly. When host Marc Maron asked him if he was scared of what the new Commander in Chief might mean for the future of our country, Springsteen said, Yeah. Of course. How could you not be? Then Sprucesteen elaborated, dropping the devastating truthbomb that all of us feel. He continued: I ve felt disgust before, but never the kind of fear that you feel now. It s as simple as the fear of, is someone simply competent enough to do this particular job? Do they simply have the pure competence to be put in the position of such responsibility? Remarking on the fear mongering tactics that Trump used to appeal to his gullible supporters, Springsteen said he understood why Trump was able to attract support from his voters, but made sure to acknowledge the fact that they d all been played for fools. He said: I think if you were effected deeply by the industrialization, globalization, and the technological advances, and you have been left behind; and somebody comes along and tells you  I m gonna bring all the jobs back. Don t worry about it. They re all coming back.  You re concerned about America changing, the browning of America  I m gonna build a wall.

9300,FLASHBACK To 2014 WaPo Headline: “Obama Should Fire John Brennan” For Lying…Only One Year After James Clapper Was Caught Lying Under Oath,"Yesterday, the leftist media spent the day wringing their hands in anticipation of finally pinning a Russian collusion story on President Trump, after General Flynn admitted to lying to the FBI about meeting with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, during the Trump transition period. It now appears that Flynn s testimony is a big nothingburger. In fact, if the media was being honest with the American people, they would be telling them that Flynn s admission doesn t hold a candle to the lies former President Barack Obama s regime was caught telling. Barack Obama s regime lied about matters that actually were much more serious in nature. Many of their lies were about covering up for the deaths of innocent Americans. From Obama s crooked former AG, Eric Holder, who lied about the illegal gun running program Fast n  Furious that was responsible for the death of US Border Agent BrianTerry, to the lies his former national security advisor, Susan Rice told, when she went on a media-blitz to knowingly lie, when she told Americans the death of 4 Americans in Benghazi, was caused by a video. It s got to be pretty bad, when a staunch Obama media ally, the Washington Post, tells him he should fire his CIA Director, John Brennan for lying.  From the Washington Post:In March, at the Council on Foreign Relations, CIA Director John Brennan was asked by NBC s Andrea Mitchell whether the CIA had illegally accessed Senate Intelligence Committee staff computers  to thwart an investigation by the committee into  the agency s past interrogation techniques. The accusation had been made earlier that day by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who said the CIA had  violated the separation-of-powers principles embodied in the United States Constitution.  Brennan answered:As far as the allegations of, you know, CIA hacking into, you know, Senate computers, nothing could be further from the truth. I mean, we wouldn t do that. I mean, that s   that s just beyond the   you know, the scope of reason in terms of what we would do. { }And, you know, when the facts come out on this, I think a lot of people who are claiming that there has been this tremendous sort of spying and monitoring and hacking will be proved wrong.Watch Brennan lie to Andrea Mitchell here:Now we know that the truth was far different. The Post s Greg Miller reports:CIA Director John O. Brennan has apologized to leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee after an agency investigation determined that its employees improperly searched computers used by committee staff to review classified files on interrogations of prisoners. { }A statement released by the CIA on Tuesday acknowledged that agency employees had searched areas of that computer network that were supposed to be accessible only to committee investigators. Agency employees were attempting to discover how congressional aides had obtained a secret CIA internal report on the interrogation program. Some employees acted in a manner inconsistent with the common understanding reached  between the CIA and lawmakers in 2009, when the committee investigation was launched, according to the agency statement, which cited a review by the CIA s inspector general. The CIA statement was first reported by McClatchy.That committee s investigation is said to be sharply critical of the CIA, finding that it exaggerated the effectiveness of harsh interrogation measures and repeatedly misled members of Congress and the executive branch. The findings are expected to be released publicly within weeks.After briefing committee leaders, Brennan  apologized to them for such actions by CIA officers as described in the [inspector general] report,  the agency statement said. Brennan also ordered the creation of an internal personnel board, led by former Sen. Evan Bayh (D-Ind.), to review the agency employees  conduct and determine  potential disciplinary measures. An apology and an internal review board might suffice if this were Brennan or intelligence leaders  first offense, but the track record is far from spotless. In 2011, Brennan claimed that dozens of U.S. drone strikes on overseas targets had not killed a single civilian. This remarkable success rate was not only disputed at the time by news reports   even supporters of the drone program called it  absurd    but as the Bureau of Investigative Journalism and the New York Times both reported later, President Obama received reports from the very beginning of his presidency about drone strikes killing numerous civilians. As Obama s top counterterrorism adviser at the time, Brennan would have received these reports as well, so either Brennan knew that his claim was a lie, or he is secretly deaf. Similarly, Brennan denied snooping on Senate computers six weeks after Feinstein first made the accusation to the CIA in private, which means either that he was lying, or he had ignored a serious charge against his agency for six weeks, then spouted off about it without any real knowledge   hardly the behavior expected of an agency director.And last year, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper lied under oath to Congress when he told Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and the Senate Intelligence Committee that the National Security Agency did not collect any kind of data on millions of Americans, a claim later disproved by documents leaked by former NSA employee Edward Snowden. Despite Clapper receiving criticism from both sides of the aisle, the damage to Clapper s and the White House s credibility on intelligence and civil liberties issues and, well, the fact that lying to Congress is a crime (though one that s difficult to prosecute), Obama has not disciplined Clapper in any way.",politics,"Dec 2, 2017"
1192, Newt Gingrich’s New Tell-All Book Reveals Trump’s Grossest Habits While On Campaign,"The eating habits of President Trump have been scrutinized by the press many times during his campaign and presidency. Once again, the President s diet will be under the microscope of the media because of former Speaker New Gingrich providing an advanced copy of his new tell-all book,  Understanding Trump,  to the Washington Examiner. Anytime a meal was served when I flew with candidate Trump aboard his nicely outfitted 757, it was invariably McDonald s, Wendy s, or a similar fast food,  wrote Mr. Gingrich in his new book. Gingrich doesn t hold his tongue in his new tell-all that accounts the time he spent as a Trump advisor during his campaign and as acting President.Ironically, Gingrich is not the first House Speaker to comment on Trump s nasty health habits.  I think his family should be concerned about his health,  Rep. Nancy Pelosi said on MSNBC Thursday.  I m concerned about his fitness for office. Time reported that his staff are forced to cater to his big ego AND bad diet choices As he settles down, they bring him a Diet Coke, while the rest of us are served water, with the Vice President sitting at one end of the table. With the salad course, Trump is served what appears to be Thousand Island dressing instead of the creamy vinaigrette for his guests. When the chicken arrives, he is the only one given an extra dish of sauce. At the dessert course, he gets two scoops of vanilla ice cream with his chocolate cream pie, instead of the single scoop for everyone else.

2847," Washington Post Issues PRICELESS ‘Apology’ To Trump, Puts Out ‘True, Unbiased’ Inauguration Story","The Washington Post, after being repeatedly dragged through the mud at the (tiny) hands of Donald Trump, not to mention also being labeled  fake news,  has decided it owes Trump an apology. They ve (sarcastically) conceded that the press has been mean and has hurt Trump s feelings, and that they ve even lied through their teeth. And they ve published the  true, unbiased  version of Trump s inauguration that he no doubt sincerely believes we should all heed.And it s amazing. It s hilarious. Its sarcasm is over the top, as it should be because Trump s overinflated opinion of himself is over the top. If it wasn t, he wouldn t have told the CIA,  Wait a minute, I made a speech. I looked out, the field was   it looked like a million, million and a half people. The Post s story addresses all of this and more with hilarious abandon. Written by Alexandra Petri, it starts off with an abject apology: I apologize to Donald Trump. As Sean Spicer so wisely said at his first news conference on Monday (It was the first. The one that happened on Saturday did not happen at all, and I recognize that!), it is unfair to be so mean and negative all the time.Here is the fair and unbiased story about the inauguration written in compliance with the Trump style guidelines that we should have been obeying all along. She also  reports  on the  apology  that all the media gave to Trump, which touches on his childish temper tantrums, his inability to let even the tiniest of slights go, and Sean Spicer s whining that the press hurts Trump s feelings:The media was there, too, and they were very sorry.  Donald,  the newscasters said,  we were mean to you. We used to laugh and call you names. We were no better than all of the other reindeer. How can you ever forgive us? Forgive you?  Donald Trump asked.  I ve already forgotten.  He smiled a big, beautiful smile.And she says,  Nothing that has ever happened or will ever happen was as great as Donald Trump s inauguration. Truth. Not. But Trump doesn t know that. In his mind, he can do no wrong. His accomplishments are great and many, his failures and faults don t exist, and the press is very, very wrong to not focus on his great accomplishments. He s a legend in his own mind.Trump, we should all remember, has the best speeches, the best words, the best everything, and Petri highlights his incessant, exaggerated bragging with this: Everyone liked Donald Trump s speech and the words that he used. They liked even more the part where he rolled up his sleeve and showed off his bicep. It was a great bicep. It made the Rock so upset to see it that he threw something down on the ground and said  darn. However, the true zingers start when Petri talks about how Trump walked through the crowd (he didn t), touching everyone  in a way that they all thought was welcome and appropriate,  (ha!) and curing diseases, kind of like Jesus, so nobody would ever need vaccines again. She then points out a piece of Trump s agenda in this gem of sarcasm: It was like the Oscars, but also like Woodstock, but also like the Super Bowl, but also like the Sermon on the Mount. If you were not there, you should just go home and die, because nothing in your life will have purpose or meaning by comparison, not even holding your newborn child in your arms or having health insurance.  [emphasis mine]And finally, she closes with the biggest zinger of all: Donald Trump is the star. People love him.He won the popular vote, too.  [emphasis mine]Considering he plans on wasting taxpayer dollars with an investigation to prove he won the popular vote, that s the best of all of them. Maybe Trump will notice this story, but not its sarcasm, and make an even bigger fool of himself on this.Featured image by Drew Angerer via Getty Images",News,"January 25, 2017"
22656,Syria Ceasefire Deal: A Cynical Ploy by Washington’s ‘Coalition’ to Buy Time for Terrorists,"21st Century Wire says This latest diplomatic development certainly appears positive on its surface, this week s declared  Syrian Ceasefire    a three-way agreement between Washington, Russia and the Syrian government (and begrudgingly by the West s other regional  stakeholders ) looks increasingly like it may just be the latest attempt to buy time   so that Washington, Turkey and Saudi Arabia can re-arm and replenish various militant fighting groups currently laying waste to Syria.Since the entrance of the Russian Air Force into the Syrian conflict theatre last October, the Washington-led Axis has gradually lost proxy-control of a number of key terrorist strongholds in Northern Syria, namely in Aleppo, and thus are unable to dictate crucial  facts on the ground  required to dictate the international media and political narratives. Unable to craft and package these narratives, the West and its dubious  coalition  are completely unable to sell an escalation of military violence in Syria.The fact that the Washington Axis has already threatened to move to a  Plan B    even before the agreement has been implemented, indicates that this diplomatic effort may in fact be  dead on arrival .

2466, Trump Gives Press Credentials To A Racist Blog That LITERALLY Publishes Fake News,"Gateway Pundit is a popular publication among white supremacists, which means it will fit right in with the Trump administration. The New York Times reports that The Donald has seen fit to grant the far-right website s Washington correspondent, Lucian B. Wintrich, press credentials, allowing him to attend White House press briefings and ask Sean Spicer questions.If Gateway Pundit sounds familiar to you, that s because the site s founder, Jim Hoft, was the source of the lie that Michael Brown fractured Officer Darren Wilson s eye socket before the Ferguson cop gunned him down in the street. Hoft claimed a stock photo of an x-ray (he removed citations from the bottom of the photo) was of Darren Wilson s alleged  orbital blowout fracture.  This literal fake news, as opposed to Trump s  fake news,  was repeated by Fox News and other right-wing sources. In reality, the officer was diagnosed with a small bruise.In November, Hoft claimed that Michelle Obama had deleted Hillary Clinton from her Twitter history all the way back to 2013. This story was repeated without fact-checking by Fox s Sean Hannity, but both were ultimately revealed to be shameless liars.Correction. Live on radio I read a gateway pundit report that @MichelleObama had deleted mentions of HRC. And a listener said BHO and  Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) November 1, 2016Elizabeth Warren did same. Fact is they didn't. I humbly apologize. Live radio  Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) November 1, 2016He sources 4Chan, for f*ck s sake:Most recently, Hoft falsely accused Washington Post editor Doris Truong of taking pictures of Rex Tillerson s notes. He has also claimed a photo of a NBA parade was a Trump rally, and helped fuel Trump s  paid protesters  lies with a fake story about a bus full of them traveling from Trump rally to Trump rally.Hoft and his cronies may be liars, but they have been staunchly pro-fascism as long as they have existed and they love him, so let them in! It s not like they re those  fake news  purveyors at CNN, after all.Trump has as of late been favoring  friendly  news sources, and it is likely that he will continue to do so   especially when he is filling the press pen with people who are willing to lie for him.featured image via Getty Images/Sean Rayford",News,"February 19, 2017"

22275,Chinese Media Warns of ‘War’ with US Following Tillerson’s Remarks South China Sea," 21st Century Wire says During yesterday s cabinet confirmation hearing in Washington DC, hawkish comments made by President-Elect Trump s Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson were very pleasing to pro-war Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham. Not so for Chinese war hawks Tillerson s remarks referred to the 3,000 acres of reclaimed land in the South China Sea in the Spratly Island chain, presumably for use by the Chinese Navy, but also as a shipping resource. China denies the new facilities will restrict freedom of movement for any international shipping.It s important to note that there is a tremendous amount of pressure being put to bear on the incoming Trump Administration by neoconservatives and perpetual war advocates like McCain, Graham, Tom Cotton, Marco Rubio and others. This relentless pressure appeared to affect Tillerson during yesterday s hearings.In response, a Chinese Communist Party publication penned a scathing OpEd in response to Tillerson s comments .Telegraphlocking Chinese access to islands in the South China Sea would require the US to  wage war , an influential Chinese state-run tabloid said on Friday, after US Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson suggested the strategy on Wednesday. The media salvo from China is the latest sign of increased tensions between the countries since President-elect Donald Trump accepted a telephone call from Taiwan s leader, Tsai Ing-wen.Mr Tillerson told his confirmation hearing before the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee that he wanted to send a signal to China that their access to islands in the disputed South China Sea  is not going to be allowed . He did not elaborate.The United States would have to  wage a large-scale war  in the South China Sea to prevent Chinese access to the islands, the Global Times said in an English language editorial.[ ] Tillerson had better bone up on nuclear power strategies if he wants to force a big nuclear power to withdraw from its own territories,  the paper added Continue this story at The TelegraphREAD MORE CHINA NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire China FilesSUPPORT OUR WORK BY SUBSCRIBING & BECOMING A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",US_News,"January 13, 2017"
3127," WATCH: Florida Gov. Rick Scott Disrespects President Obama, Calls Trump After Fort Lauderdale Mass Shooting","Rather than call the sitting president who could actually help him, Florida Governor Rick Scott dissed President Obama by calling Donald Trump instead.On Friday, a gunman entered the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport and killed five people while wounded eight others. The incident unfolded throughout the afternoon and police finally took the shooter into custody.When a tragedy like this occurs, a governor usually makes a phone call to the White House to speak to the president. But Florida Governor Rick Scott disrespected President Obama and contacted Trump to speak with him and Mike Pence about the situation.Scott went out of his way to mention that to reporters and seemed to suggest that President Obama should have reached out to him.The Scott dodged follow-up questions from reporters about his disrespect towards the sitting president by claiming that now isn t the time for politics, even though shunning President Obama while speaking to Donald Trump is clearly political.Here s the video via Twitter.Florida Gov. Rick Scott says he has reached out to Trump and Pence since the shooting, but not POTUS. pic.twitter.com/y8iVykaxV3  ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) January 6, 2017So Rick Scott chose to keep Trump and Pence informed but not the one man who can actually do something to assist Florida during this tough time? Seriously?!Republicans have been disrespecting President Obama for eight years and with 14 days left until Inauguration Day, one would think that Republicans would at least be more respectful. But no, they would rather continue hypocritically calling for unity behind Trump and asking everyone to respect Trump while continuing to disrespect the sitting President of the United States. They would rather pretend that Trump is already president. Republicans couldn t even show respect to President Obama in the wake of a mass shooting and used it to as opportunity to insult him.This is the last straw. In no uncertain terms should Democrats step one toe across the aisle to work with Republicans over the next four years and Trump deserves to be disrespected at all times no matter what. Turnabout is fair play. All of Trump s nominees should be blocked and his agenda obstructed 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year for ALL four years. If disrespect is what Republicans want, then that s what they should get.And people were NOT happy about Rick Scott talking to Trump instead of President Obama like he should have done.@ABCPolitics PRESIDENT is BARACK OBAMA  the only one with legal authority to do anything at this point.

The complaint says Sturman then pulled out a flag and began to light it on fire.The Trump supporters attempted to put out the fire, which  enraged  Sturman.

111, GOP Senate Candidate Turns Out To Be A Disgusting Child Molester,"The Republican favorite in Alabama s Senate race next month is being accused of inappropriate sexual conduct with a 14-year-old girl in 1979, The Washington Post reports. It s not just one child that the uber-Conservative Christian is accused of approaching when he was in his 30s, but the newspaper also found three other women who said that Roy Moore had approached them around a similar time when they were between the ages of 16 and 18.Leigh Corfman says she was 14 years old when Moore, then 32-years-old, approached her outside a courtroom in Etowah County, Ala. At that time, Moore was an assistant district attorney. Corfman s mother went inside for a child custody hearing after Moore offered to watch her daughter. He said,  Oh, you don t want her to go in there and hear all that. I ll stay out here with her,    says Corfman s mother, Nancy Wells, 71.  I thought, how nice for him to want to take care of my little girl. Once he was alone with Corfman, Moore asked for her phone number. It was days later that he picked her up around the corner from her house, drove her about 30 minutes to his home in the woods, then flattered her by telling her how pretty she was and kissed her. But by the second visit, things turned even worse when he took off the 14-year-old s shirt and pants and removed his clothes. Moore then allegedly touched her over her bra and underpants and guided her hand to touch him over his underwear, according to the paper. I wanted it over with   I wanted out,  she recalled thinking at the time.  Please just get this over with. Whatever this is, just get it over. Two of Corfman s childhood friends explained that she told them that she was seeing an older man, and one said that Corfman identified the man as Roy Moore.Corfman s mother said that her daughter told her about the encounter more than a decade later, during the time that Moore was becoming more prominent as a local judge.The Post spoke with three other women who said that Moore pursued them when they were between the ages of 16 and 18 and he was in his early 30s. All three of the women the paper spoke to said that they never had any sexual contact with Moore outside of kissing. According to one woman who was 18-years-old and in high school at the time, Moore would bring bottles of wine to their dates, even though the legal drinking age was 19.One woman, Wendy Miller, said that she first met Moore when she was a 14-year-old working as  Santa s helper  at a mall. He began asking her out when she was 16 years old.But, conservatives will overlook Moore trying to diddle children.This is such a sad, punk move from Breitbart, and people are going to remember it. pic.twitter.com/V8tndfAeCD  Dave Weigel (@daveweigel) November 9, 2017Conservatives voted an admitted sexual predator into the highest office in the land, so Moore might get more votes following this explosive report.

2385, Muhammad Ali’s Son Detained At Airport Because His Name Sounds Too Muslim,"Immigration officials in Florida proved how out of control things are in Trump s America by detaining the son of Muhammad Ali because his name happens to sound too Muslim for their liking.Muhammad Ali Jr. and his mother, Khalilah Camacho-Ali, were on their way home after speaking at a Black History Month event in Montego Bay, Jamaica. On Feb. 7, they flew into Fort Lauderdale, Florida. And then things took a disturbing turn.Chris Mancini, a lawyer and friend of the family says they were pulled to the side as they were going through customs. Khalilah Camacho-Ali was released when she pulled out a photo of her with the legendary boxer, but Muhammad Ali Jr. didn t have such a photo. Apparently, being related to a famous person would have meant more to officials than the fact that he s an American citizen with a U.S. passport to prove it.Ali Jr. was held by immigration officials and questioned for almost two hours. Where did you get your name from?  they asked him over and over. When they asked him if he was a Muslim, he said yes, and that really set off alarm bells for officials. They continued to question him about his religion and repeatedly asked him where he was born. Just for the record, he was born in Philadelphia in 1971.USA Today reports:While Ali Jr. was detained, Camacho-Ali ran around the airport asking,  Where s my son?  and begging for help, according to Mancini. Because incidents involving customs officials are considered to be on federal soil, local police had no jurisdiction to help her. Ali Jr. was eventually released two hours later, and the family contacted Mancini the following day.They have both traveled all over the world and never, ever, have they been subjected to this kind of treatment, said Mancini.  To the Ali family, it s crystal clear that this is directly linked to Mr. Trump s efforts to ban Muslims from the United States,  he added. Imagine walking into an airport and being asked about your religion,  he said.  This is classic customs profiling. According to Mancini, the Ali family is debating whether or not to file a federal lawsuit and are searching for others who have been subjected to this kind of racial profiling and harassment.Featured image via Andrew H.

367, Ohio Fireman In Deep Sh*t For HORRIBLE Remarks About Saving ‘N*****s’,"A firefighter in Ohio recently came under fire for expressing his  economic uncertainty  (a synonym the media concocted for  racism  while attempting to explain why people voted for Trump) about rescuing black people.If it came down to choosing to rescue a single dog or  a million n*ggers,  Franklin township firefighter Tyler Roysdon says he would save the dog, which is  more important than  all those African-Americans he hates.According to Roysdon s Facebook  likes,  he is a fan of Donald Trump, Duck Dynasty, and far-Right Facebook group  Uncle Sam s Misguided Children    just so you know what sort of person we re dealing with.Roysdon was suspended from his position  indefinitely  as soon as township officials learned of the post, which went viral on social media because that s what happens when terrible people say terrible things. It s also very likely he will lose his job according to a statement from officials: Recently, a Franklin Township volunteer firefighter posted unacceptable remarks on social media.  Upon gaining knowledge of this information, Fire Chief Steve Bishop immediately contacted the firefighter and directed the comments be removed.  The firefighter was suspended without pay until the Board of Township Trustees could meet to determine a course of action.  Chief Bishop does not have the authority to terminate employees.  Termination of any township employee requires a vote by the Board of Trustees. It s unclear if Roysdon s racism has ever affected his work or if he has caused anyone to die, but this is absolutely something that should be investigated.Featured image via screengrab",News,"September 16, 2017"

They told East Liverpool administrators they needed to stop their choir from singing the Lord s Prayer at graduation.Rather than fighting legal battles, the school removed the song from Sunday s program. But instead of losing part of the ceremony, students decided to lead their own prayer.Graduation at East Liverpool is filled with tradition, and this year students rejected change. I know a lot of my student body was uncomfortable with it, just because it is tradition to have prayer at our school,  said Cami Post, class of 2016 vice president.

11569,UNPRECEDENTED: New York Times To Run 30 Sec Ad During Oscars…Bashing Trump…Defending FAKE News [VIDEO],"The New York Times is set to launch a television ad during the Academy Awards that seems to heavily target statements made by President Donald Trump.The 30-second ad, entitled,  The Truth,  features black text flashing on a white screen with the words  The truth is,  followed by a variety of statements.According to a report in The Hill, at least three of the statements were in reference to Trump. The truth is the media is dishonest,  reads one statement, a likely reference to Trump s frequent comments slamming the media s honesty.Here s another statement from the ad:  The truth is alternative facts are lies.  That one s an obvious reference to a comment made by Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway.The ad runs through a series of other phrases, some targeting conservative talking points such as  we have to protect our borders,   the emails are dangerous,  and  climate change is a hoax. The ad finishes up with the phrase  The truth is hard to find,  which then switches to  The truth is hard to know,  and finally concludes with  The truth is more important now than never.   MRCTVThat final phrase is pretty clearly seen as a parting shot at the Trump administration s relationship with the press:Recently the Times featured an article touting the  renewed sense of mission  for journalists in the Trump era looking to take down the Republican president by uncovering a Watergate-style scandal.The New York paper is not alone in its pretentious claims of being the guardian of truth, on Tuesday, The Washington Post added this slogan to its website:  Democracy dies in darkness.  Apparently only the light of the Post s reporting can save the nation from the  darkness  of a Trump presidency.Just on Sunday, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus was forced to shoot down yet another misleading report from the Times about supposed contact between the Trump campaign and Russian intelligence officials. On NBC s Meet the Press, he told moderator Chuck Todd:I mean we ve spent days talking about a story that says that our campaign had constant contacts with Russian spies. And I can tell you, I ve talked to the top levels of the intelligence community. And they ve assured me that that New York Times story was grossly overstated, and inaccurate and totally wrong .It is this sort of fake news stuff that is enormously important that, when you get a front page story of The New York Times without a single source on the record saying that your campaign had constant contacts   they didn t say one contact. They didn t say two contacts. It doesn t matter. We have not been informed of even that. But to say,  Constant contact? On Friday, NBC s Today was thrilled by the upcoming Times television spot, with reporter Joe Fryer declaring:  No matter who wins, politics will likely take the stage Sunday .The New York Times will even debut its first-ever Oscars ad, with the message,  The truth is more important than ever.

6309, Obama’s Doing Something BIG To Raise Pay For Millions Of Americans (VIDEO),"Throughout his presidency, President Obama has dedicated himself to exploring policies with the goal of making life better for working Americans and making sure they are fairly compensated for their time and effort.Unfortunately, the GOP has become a major obstacle for the President ever since he stepped foot in the White House. After a Republican Congress made it perfectly clear that they won t even consider a minimum wage increase, the Obama administration was forced to seek out another alternative   and it s finally going to pay off. Thanks to Obama s overhaul on overtime pay   which doubles the salary level that workers must be paid overtime, millions of Americans are going to have more money in their pockets. This is major news, because this law hasn t been changed in over ten years!When Obama first mentioned that he wanted to revamp overtime pay, hardly anyone took him seriously. At his State of the Union address last year, the President said,  We still need to make sure employees get the overtime they ve earned.  Then, he unveiled a proposal to raise the income thresholds for those who would be eligible for overtime. It still seemed like faraway goal, until yesterday when the Labor Department finalized those new rules   an initiative that the Huffington Post called  one of the most ambitious economic reforms of the Obama era. Vice President Joe Biden announced the decision on Tuesday, stating that middle-class workers have  been getting clobbered  for decades. Biden said: The American people want to work. They want a fair shot. No handouts, no guarantees. Just a good job at a fair wage. Under the new rules, all workers earning salaries under the overtime salary threshold are entitled to time-and-a-half pay when they work over 40 hours per week   which many do. The previous threshold was only $23,660   making millions of struggling, hard-working Americans ineligible. But thanks to the Obama administration, that number will be doubled to $47,476, which guarantees overtime rights for any salaried workers earning underneath that number. Before this was changed, only 7% of Americans were eligible for overtime. And it gets better   the threshold will be updated by the Labor Department every three years to make sure that it keeps up with inflation.
