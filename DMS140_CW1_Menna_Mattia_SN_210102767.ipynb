    "\n",
    "According to [[2]](#references) the problem of automatically detecting fake news is not easy to solve because of two factors: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The Fake news content can be images or video or a podcast, very easy to fake but a lot more complex to analyze and preprocess than normal text.\n",
    "2. There is no way in knowing where people take their information from. The web is full of platforms that provide news and governance is basically non-existent\n",
    "\n",
    "But nonetheless, the ML community has developed a series of solutions to tackle the problem with promising results (at least in the text-based news domain). In the survey by Shivam B. Parikh and Pradeep K. Atrey [[3]](#references) the approaches are divided into six methodology groups: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Linguistic Features-based Methods, based on the extraction and classification of linguistic features from fake news, usually using a tf-idf representation of the text.\n",
    "2. Deception Modeling based Methods, based on the extraction of the relations between text units on a story as a hierarchical tree.\n",
    "3. Clustering based Methods, based on agglomerative clustering algorithms (such as KNN) trained on a large number of data sets.\n",
    "4. Predictive Modeling based Methods, based on logistic regression and positive or negative coefficients to point out the deception probability of a given text.\n",
    "5. Content Cues based Methods, based on the assumption that the fake news is created solely to engage the readers, unlike real news,  and some form of the linguistic pattern are an indicator of this purpose\n",
    "6. Non-Text Cues based Methods, focuses on the analysis of two non-text components of news: images and user behavior.\n",

    "<b>Precision</b>\n",
    "\n",

    "<b>Recall</b>\n",

    "Recall is the rate of positive instances that were correctly identified by the classificator over all the real positive instances, it is calculated as $\\frac{TP}{TP + FN}$, where FN is the False Negative.

    "\n",
    "<b>Accuracy</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Accuracy is the rate of correct prediction identified by the classificator over the entire sample, it is often expressed as the percentage of correct answers given against a test set. It is calculated as $\\frac{TP+TN}{TP+TN+FP+FN}$\n",

    "<b>F1-Score</b>\n",
    "    \n",
    "F1 Score is the harmonic mean of the precision and recall, it is calculated as  $2*\\frac{Precision*Recall}{Precision+Recall}$. It takes into consideration both precision and recall and gives an overall score of the model. An F-score of 1 means that the model has perfect precision and recall, an f-score of 0 means that either recall or precision is 0.\n",
    "\n",

    "### 2.3 Classification Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The classificators that we'll be building are three different flavors of ensembles: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Hard Blending Ensemble**, is a type of ensemble algorithm under the stacking generalization. There's is a meta-model that is created using the predictions of the base models, then the \"blender\" is fitted using a classificator model and the final prediction are the prediction of the blender model. In our case, the classificator of choice is the Logistic Regressor. The difference with the stacking generalization is that the meta-model is trained using a holdout dataset instead of k-fold cross-validation. The functions that implement this model are the \"fit_ensemble\" and the \"predict_ensemble\" taken from the beautiful article in [[10]](#references) with some minor modification.\n",
    "2. **Soft Blending Ensemble**, is the same as the hard, the difference is that the meta-model is composed of the probability of the given class instead of the actual prediction. It is implemented with the same functions as above with the difference in the hard parameter\n",
    "3. **Soft Voting Ensemble**, is a simple voting ensemble in which the majority vote of the base models is the model prediction. It is soft because the base model's votes are weighted with the accuracy score of the models themselves on the validation set. The implementation is from sklearn but there's the \"evaluate_models\" function that is used to calculate the accuracies across the base models to be used as weights for the vote\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach is similar to [[9]](#references), with different ensemble methods and base models.\n"

    "### 3.2 Summary and conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis has presented 6 commonly used algorithms for classification and used them to create an ensemble with three different methodologies. \n",
    "The objective of the paper was to create an ensemble that outperforms the models it is composed of. The objective has been partially met for the LIAR dataset and fully met for the ISOT dataset. The secondary objective was to find out which of the three methodologies to train an ensemble is the best and the answer seems arguable to be the probability blending ensemble. \n",
    "Another reflection must be done on the very low accuracy performance of the algorithms for the LIAR dataset, seems that the tf-idf matrix did not capture enough information from the statements to be anywhere accurate. In this paper, we focused on the text statement ignoring the other interesting columns presented in the dataset. The Non-text attributes of the dataset could be a key factor in training a successful algorithm, the speaker of the statement and the affiliation party can be a key indicators for tweaking the probability of a statement being fake news.\n",
    "\n",
    "This work is further validation of the work presented in [[8]](#references) and [[9]](#references), an additional quantitative proof that the ensembles showed an overall better score as compared to the weak learners.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further extensions on the idea presented in this work could be the hyper-parameter optimization for the learners with cross-fold validation, one of the hyper-parameter being the ensemble components (different sets of classificators). This can be a very slow process if using the entire ISOT dataset for example, and can probably increase the overfitting of the final ensemble."
